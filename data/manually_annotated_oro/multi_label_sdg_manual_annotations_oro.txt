493194085	Anti-Trafficking (ILL-)Efforts: The Legal Regulation of Women‚Äôs Bodies and Relationships in Cambodia	Global imaginations on human trafficking have been captured by a robust mythology that constructs the consenting Third World sex worker as simply a victim of trafficking for sexual exploitation. This anti-trafficking discourse has influenced Cambodia‚Äôs legal reform, which has resulted in an increase of abuse against sex workers and has denied Cambodian women their right to marry foreign men. Despite evidence indicating the diversity of the sex industry and its correlation to different levels of sex workers‚Äô autonomy, decision-makers have failed to revise the anti-trafficking framework to reflect the reality of the divergent lives of women who engage in sex as a livelihood	['SDG05', 'SDG08']
479296219	Unemployment and Making a Living	The issue of employment seems simple on the surface but conceals complexity and contestation. The massive transformations in global economy and society over the last decades include the huge change from rural to urban societies; disruptive changes from predominantly agrarian towards precarious service sector 'informal' employment; and moves from mechanical forms of industry towards the information age and the rise of the internet	['SDG08', 'SDG10']
478833192	‚ÄòEpidemics in a Mist‚Äô: Medical Climatology and Cholera in Victorian Visual Culture	The article explores how Victorian visual culture was a vital force in the construction and dissemination of medical theories on the connection between climate and health. During the nineteenth century, the seemingly inexplicable and deadly nature of many epidemic diseases compelled British medics to investigate all possible reasons for their spread. Focusing on cholera, the article will examine how, in an effort to understand what was seen at the time as a mysterious disease, Victorian medics increasingly concentrated on the climate of India and unusual weather in Britain as propagators of the malady. Supplementing the dominant miasma theory, medics explained how the seemingly airborne sources of cholera resulted from a state of England‚Äôs air that resembled the tropical environment of the subcontinent. In an effort to highlight the correlation between cholera and the atmosphere, they produced medical climatology reports containing diagrams that juxtaposed the data on the disease‚Äôs mortality rates with measurements of meteorological phenomena. These images, rather than serving simply as illustrations, became a crucial part of medical arguments. As the article will demonstrate, in attempting to visualize the medical climatology of cholera, the diagrams mapped the disease to certain atmospheric conditions, suggesting that cholera could be quantified and controlled. Yet, in doing so, the images also implied that cholera had a real material presence in the air of Britain, powerfully evoking visual tropes of the disease as a substance that had the potential to contaminate the very landscape of the nation	['SDG03']
541720690	Mobile Messaging and Resourcefulness: A Post-digital Ethnography	This book advocates a new post-digital linguistic ethnography approach to unpacking mobile communication and enabling a more informed understanding of individuals‚Äô communicative practices in cities today. Drawing on data from a group of ordinary working people, multilingual individuals from superdiverse cities across the United Kingdom, the volume brings observations from this data together to form a new concept of ‚Äòresourcefulness‚Äô as a means of explaining the emergent sense of agency individuals develop towards remediating existing forms of technology in their everyday lives. The book in turn establishes the notion of the ‚Äònetworked individual‚Äô by way of demonstrating the ways in which communicative practices cross spaces and platforms. Further chapters detail examples to highlight resourcefulness at work in enabling more efficient business communication, routes to self-expression and the creation and development of social support systems, while a concluding chapter looks at both the limitations and possibilities of resourcefulness and directions for future research. This innovative volume will be of particular interest to students and researchers in applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, linguistic ethnography, and media and communication studies	['SDG04']
428927379	Toward an LGBT-affirmative informed paradigm for children who break gender norms: A comment on Drummond et al	In this commentary, the author reviews methodological and conceptual shortcomings of recent articles by K. D. Drummond, S. J. Bradley, M. Peterson-Badali, and K. J. Zucker (2008) as well as G. Rieger, J. A. W. Linsenmeier, L. Gygax, and J. M. Bailey (2008), which sought to predict adult sexual identity from childhood gender identity. The author argues that such research needs to incorporate a greater awareness of how stigmatization affects identity processes. Multidimensional models of gender identity that describe variation in children‚Äôs responses to pressure to conform to gender norms are particularly useful in this regard (S. K. Egan & D. G. Perry, 2001). Experiments on the interpretation of developmental data are reviewed to evidence how cultural assumptions about sexuality can impact theories of sexual identity development in unintended ways. The author concludes that understanding the development of children presumed most likely to grow up with sexual minority identities requires a consideration of the cultural contexts in which identities develop and in which psychologists theorize	['SDG04']
590242813	Nursing students experiences of end-of-life care	Background: Undergraduate nursing students spend a significant amount of time in clinical placements where they are involved in care at the end of a person's life and care after death. While their role is to provide compassionate care, some students feel wholly unprepared. Aims: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore student nurses‚Äô experiences of care in death, dying and post death care, and to explore how students can be better prepared to provide such care. Methods: This is a qualitative descriptive study that is concerned with the subjective reality of participant's experiences. Findings: Six themes were developed from the analysis: first encounters with death and dying; preparedness; mentoring and support received; the caring role; striving to cope; working with families and working through COVID-19. Conclusion: Students described their experience of placements in end-of-life care as challenging, yet were also able to adopt ways to develop as compassionate practitioners	['SDG04']
541720661	(Wo)men in the Middle: The Gendered Role of Supporting Prisoners	Prisons are, by their very nature, gendered institutions. Despite women making up a small percentage of the prison population (House of Commons Library, 2020), those supporting prisoners are generally women - especially mothers and partners (Booth and Masson, 2021; Codd, 2008). In understanding women‚Äôs experiences of criminal justice, it is prudent to consider the women who are punished by the system despite not being incarcerated themselves. This chapter sheds light on these women‚Äôs experiences. First, through a review of the growing international literature that illustrates how the economic and relational implications as well as the health, stigma and care for children of prisoners are overwhelmingly experienced by women in the community attempting to keep their families together. Following this, a case study showcasing the excellent work of one organisation, The Straight Path Resettlement Project (SPR) in Leicester, England, discusses Ferzana Dakri‚Äôs experience of working in the community with ‚ÄòBAME‚Äô Muslim women who have imprisoned loved ones. In viewing prison as sites of punishment, and appreciating how these pains extend beyond those incarcerated, this chapter draws attention to the multiple ways that women supporting prisoners are simultaneously harmed	['SDG16', 'SDG05']
564341549	ChatGPT and the Future of Legal Education and Practice	The launch of ChatGPT, a natural language open-source AI platform, in November 2022 has taken the world by storm and artificial intelligence appears to be at a watershed moment in technological advancement. This article explores the emergence of ChatGPT and considers the implications for legal education and practice. It will examine how Law Schools can develop strategies for assessments to make them more challenging for generative AI while educating students on its potential in the workplace. All legal educators are now on a journey to navigate the complexities of open-source AI technology and comprehend its implications. We cannot ignore or underestimate the potential impact on both legal education and legal practice, and we must consider new methods to incorporate AI technology into our teaching	['SDG04']
591806949	Validation of Chinese version of the 5-item WHO well-being index in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients	Background: For better disease management and improved prognosis, early identification of co-morbid depression in diabetic patients is warranted. the WHO-5 well-being index (WHO-5) has been used to screen for depression in diabetic patients, and its Chinese version (WHO-5-C) has been validated. However, its psychometric properties remain to be further validated in the type 2 diabetes patient population. The aim of our study was to examine the reliability and validity of the WHO-5-C in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 patients from July 2014 to March 2015. All patients should complete the WHO-5-C, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the 20-item Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID-20), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Internal consistency of WHO-5 was revealed by Cronbach‚Äôs alpha, and constructive validity by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Relationship with PHQ-9, HAM-D, and PAID-20 was examined for concurrent validity, and ROC analysis was performed for criterion validity. Results: The WHO-5-C presented satisfactory reliability (Cronbach‚Äôs alpha = 0.88). CFA confirmed the unidimensional factor structure of WHO-5-C. The WHO-5-C had significant negative correlation with HAM-D (r = -0.610), PHQ-9 (r = -0.694) and PAID-20 (r = -0.466), confirming good concurrent validity. Using M.I.N.I as the gold standard, the cut-off value of WHO-5-C was 42, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.75. Conclusion: The WHO-5-C holds satisfactory reliability and validity that is suitable for depression screening in type 2 diabetes patients as a short and convenient instrument	['SDG03']
478547507	Mapping Disagreement around Smart City devices	This paper is a preliminary report of a longterm participant-actor ethnography following a Smart City mobile phone app that is part of a EU research project. The study uses an actor-network theory approach to follow the app and via interviews with the app designer and observations of the EU research project, argues that these technologies are surprising human/machine hybrids whose main qualities are their affective affordances which enrol large numbers of users. The paper tracks a number of contradictory framings and uncovers ontological disagreement about what the app is sensing. Smart City technologies have not been black boxed yet, and are still at the stage of performing as affective hybrids that need to enrol actors. This means that the networks around Smart Cities are still malleable and it is still possible to critique existing tools and to develop new models and forms of agency for Smart City technologies	['SDG09']
564341486	Innovations in cancer nursing education across Europe.	With 2.7 million people in the European Union diagnosed with cancer, 1.3 million people dying from cancer in 2020 and, without intervention, the mortality rates attributed to cancer projected to increase by 24% by 2035, there have been powerful mandates at European level to tackle the burden of cancer across Europe and at national level ( European Commission, 2021a , European Commission, 2021b ). Nurses play an important role caring for people affected by cancer as members of multi-disciplinary teams and playing a pivotal role in delivering, leading, developing cancer care and services at clinical and strategic levels ( Mitema et al., 2019 ; European Oncology Nursing Society, 2022 ). However, nursing and cancer care face challenges arising from workforce shortages, under-investment in services, variable education opportunities and under representation in decision-making. In response, Drury et al., 2023 set out an agenda for innovation and disruption across education, policy, research, profession and practice to ensure the sustainability of cancer care services and care for people living with, and after cancer. These authors argue for partnership, exchange of learning and co-design for the continued advancement of cancer nursing, with a critical focus on identifying and addressing inequities in role recognition and access to specialist cancer nursing education throughout Europe	['SDG04']
564341466	Beliefs of fun in learning and attitudes to inclusive education	A significant proportion of teachers are concerned about their capacity to satisfy the educational requirements of students with disabilities in general education classrooms. Fun in learning also has a good effect on the implementation of inclusion, as does the attitude of the teachers. There needs to be more data to support the differing perspectives on inclusive education held by general and special education teachers. This study's objective is to examine the outlook on inclusive education held by general and special education instructors in Indonesia and the link between their belief in fun teaching and learning. The Multidimensional Attitudes toward Inclusive Education Scales (MATIES) will be used to investigate attitudes about inclusive education. It comprises of 18 questions that are aimed at assessing the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of attitudes toward inclusion in an efficient way. The ten-item questionnaire has been devised to assess the fun of teaching and learning. Validity and dependability were used in the development of the instruments, whereas the Bivariate Correlate test was utilized to analyze the data. The highest subscale mean of teachers‚Äô attitudes towards inclusion on the 1 to 6 scale is a behavioral scale which has a mean of approximately 4,82 (SD=0,79), and the mean for teachers belief about fun in learning is 3,27 from range 1 to 4 and SD=0,29 which is a high level of belief of fun in teaching	['SDG04']
591441790	A Device for Prehabilitation of Total Knee Replacement Surgery (Slider): Usability Study	Background: Rehabilitation, or ‚Äúprehabilitation,‚Äù is essential in preparing for and recovering from knee replacement surgery. The recent demand for these services has surpassed available resources, a situation further strained by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a pivot toward digital solutions such as web- or app-based videos and wearables. These solutions, however, face challenges with user engagement, calibration requirements, and skin contact issues. This study evaluated the practicality of a low-contact, gamified device designed to assist with prehabilitation exercises.Objective: The study aimed to assess the practicality and user-friendliness of a newly designed physiotherapy device (Slider) that enables exercise monitoring without the need for direct contact with the skin.Methods: A total of 17 patients awaiting knee replacement surgery at a UK National Health Service (NHS) hospital participated in this study. They used the device over a 2-week period and subsequently provided feedback through a usability and acceptability questionnaire.Results:The study was completed by all participants, with a majority (13/17, 76%) finding the device intuitive and easy to use. The majority of patients were satisfied with the device‚Äôs ability to meet their presurgery physiotherapy requirements (16/17, 94%) and expressed a willingness to continue using it (17/17, 100%). No safety issues or adverse effects were reported by the participants.Conclusions: The results indicate that the device was found to be a feasible option for patients to conduct presurgery physiotherapy exercises independently, away from a clinical setting. Further research involving a larger and more diverse group of participants is recommended to validate these findings more robustly	['SDG03']
492011049	Long-term floristic and climatic stability of northern Indochina: Evidence from the Oligocene Ha Long flora, Vietnam	The antiquity of the tropical Asian flora is being revealed by recent detailed work on a number of Cenozoic plant megafossil sites, some of which have been radiometrically dated for the first time, but our knowledge of how the highly diverse modern biota came into being remains poor due to a sparsity of records. In this paper, we describe fossil plant assemblages from the Oligocene Dong Ho Formation of the Ha Long region, northern Vietnam. The Oligocene Ha Long megafossil flora has so far yielded 38 species, including conifers and angiosperms mainly belonging to Fagaceae, Lauraceae and Dipterocarpaceae, all with significant tropical Asian kinship. The Ha Long flora is similar to other Paleogene floras from southern China, especially those from the Pan Gulf of Tonkin region. The Ha Long floral composition is typical of a tropical-subtropical ecotone and the vegetation is reconstructed as a lowland tropical evergreen forest mixed with calcicole (limestone-loving) taxa. These taxa and the vegetation type they comprise still exist in this area. Palaeoclimate reconstruction made using both the Coexistence Approach and the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program indicate a mean annual temperature of ~20 ¬∞C, a coldest month mean temperature around 10 ¬∞C, and yearly precipitation averaging almost 2000 mm. These results suggest a warm and humid peripheral tropical environment. Floristic and climatic comparison within the Ha Long and other southern China palaeofloras reveals a long-term environmental, floristic and vegetational stability in this region since the Paleogene. This long-maintained plant diversity also provided a source for populating the East Asian flora and vegetation after the late Paleogene East Asian arid belt retreat	['SDG13', 'SDG15']
479004898	Techno-Legal Supertoys: Smart Contracts and the Fetishization of Legal Certainty	Smart Legal Contracts: Computable Law in Theory and Practice is a landmark investigation into one of the most important trends at the interface of law and technology: the effort to harness emerging digital technologies to change the way that parties form and perform contracts. While developments in distributed ledger technology have brought the topic of 'smart contracts' into the mainstream of legal attention, this volume takes a broader approach to ask how computers can be used in the contracting process.This book assesses how contractual promises are expressed in software and how code-based artefacts can be incorporated within more conventional legal structures. With incisive contributions from members of the judiciary, legal scholars, practitioners, and computer scientists, this book sets out to frame the borders of an emerging area of law and start a more productive dialogue between the various disciplines involved in the evolution of contracts as software. It provides the first step towards a more disciplined approach to computational contracts that avoids the techno-legal ambiguities of 'smart contracts' and reveals an emerging taxonomy of approaches to encoding contracts in whole or in part. Conceived and written during a time when major legal systems began to engage with the advent of contracts in computable form, and aimed at a fundamental level of enquiry, this collection will provide essential insight into future trends and will provide a point of orientation for future scholarship and innovation	['SDG09']
565843280	The Implications of Large Language Models for CS Teachers and Student	The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has generated a significant amount of excitement both in industry and among researchers. Recently, tools that leverage LLMs have made their way into the classroom where they help students generate code and help instructors generate learning materials. There are likely many more uses of these tools -- both beneficial to learning and possibly detrimental to learning. To help ensure that these tools are used to enhance learning, educators need to not only be familiar with these tools, but with their use and potential misuse. The goal of this BoF is to raise awareness about LLMs and to build a learning community around their use in computing education. Aligned with this goal of building an inclusive learning community, our BoF is led by globally distributed discussion leaders, including undergraduate researchers, to facilitate multiple coordinated discussions that can lead to a broader conversation about the role of LLMs in CS education	['SDG04']
591441828	Material Setting and Reform Experience in English Institutions for Fallen Women, 1838-1910	Tracing the history of four English case studies, this book explores how, from outward appearance to interior furnishings, the material worlds of reform institutions for ‚Äòfallen‚Äô women reflected their moral purpose and shaped the lived experience of their inmates. Variously known as asylums, refuges, magdalens, penitentiaries, Houses or Homes of Mercy, the goal of such institutions was the moral ‚Äòrehabilitation‚Äô of unmarried but sexually experienced ‚Äòfallen‚Äô women. Largely from the working-classes, such women ‚Äì some of whom had been sex workers ‚Äì were represented in contradictory terms. Morally tainted and a potential threat to respectable family life, they were also worthy of pity and in need of ‚Äòsaving‚Äô from further sin. Fuelled by rising prostitution rates, from the early decades of the nineteenth century the number of moral reform institutions for ‚Äòfallen‚Äô women expanded across Britain and Ireland. Through a programme of laundry, sewing work and regular religious instruction, the period of institutionalisation and moral re-education of around two years was designed to bring about a change in behaviour, readying inmates for economic self-sufficiency and re-entry into society in respectable domestic service. To achieve their goal, institutional authorities deployed an array of ritual, material, religious and disciplinary tools, with mixed results	['SDG05', 'SDG10']
591441754	Towards a post-imperial and Global IR?: Revisiting Khatami‚Äôs Dialogue among Civilisations	This article argues that Dialogue among Civilisations can be put forward as a crucial contribution to debates addressing IR‚Äôs Eurocentrism. It highlights the blurring of West/non-West, domestic/international, and imperial/post-imperial bifurcations. This is evident in three ways. First, Dialogue among Civilisations needs to be appreciated in Iran‚Äôs wider historical context and its multifaceted intellectual heritages. This demonstrates that the idea of the West as distinctly different from the East is problematic because of engagement between Iran and the so-called West. Second, Khatami‚Äôs intellectual endeavours are based on a simultaneous engagement with Western political thought, Islamic philosophy, and the idea of Ancient Iran. Finally, the notion itself reflects an internal dialogue whereby Western civilisation along with Islam and Iran‚Äôs pre-Islamic heritages are considered integral to Iranian political culture. Furthermore, it is an aspiration for how post-colonial Muslim societies can engage with colonial power while maintaining a post-colonial authenticity. Our contention is that an in-depth understanding of Iran alongside a revisiting of Khatami‚Äôs Dialogue among Civilisations can act as a means of bringing the perspective of the ‚Äòother‚Äô into debates on the international and our epistemological and ontological understanding of the West	['SDG10', 'SDG16']
565284335	The influence of tax authorities on the employment of tax practitioners: Empirical evidence from a survey and interview study	Tax practitioners play a crucial role in the degree of taxpayers‚Äô compliance ‚Äì a role that has increased as tax systems worldwide have become more complex. However, little is known about tax authorities‚Äô impact on taxpayers‚Äô decisions to employ tax practitioners. Based on earlier research on motivations to employ a tax practitioner and the extended slippery slope framework of tax compliance, we conducted two studies which provide some answers. A survey study ‚Äì comprising a representative sample of 500 Austrian self-employed taxpayers‚Äì revealed that financial gain is not the most important reason to employ a tax practitioner but instead the motivation to avoid problems with the tax authorities. Related to that, we also find that taxpayers‚Äô perception of tax authorities wielding coercive power motivates them to employ tax practitioners. In the interview study with 33 self-employed taxpayers and 30 tax auditors, taxpayers indicated that they sought to avoid contact with tax officers by employing tax practitioners. This finding was supported by tax officers who reported preferring interaction with tax practitioners over direct contact with taxpayers. The two studies point to the complex relationship between taxpayers, tax authorities and tax practitioners, and allow the drawing of theoretical and practical implications	['SDG17']
543078028	Migrants as ‚Äúdissonant harmony-seekers‚Äù and migrant life in ‚Äúfoam‚Äù	PurposeMigration of the Turkish new middle-class ‚Äì high-skilled, well-educated, young professionals ‚Äì has been growing in recent years. This paper explores their migration experience and discusses the role of physical and virtual bubbles in the formation of transnational communities and processes of adjustment to a new place.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is based on a qualitative inquiry collecting data via semi-structured interviews with 18 London-based Turkish migrants and a digital ethnographic study of three Facebook groups that bring together the Turkish migrant community in Richmond, London.FindingsFindings indicate that the migration of the new middle class differs conceptually from existing typologies. The paper proposes the concept of ‚Äúdissonant harmony-seekers‚Äù and elaborates on their interactions to demonstrate that, in the Internet age, the traditional image of migrants living in isolated localised bubbles is no longer accurate. Findings also indicate a pragmatic and functional engagement with the bubbles, with migrants sporadically interacting with the bubbles to meet their individual needs in information, education and employment. Originality/valueThis paper contributes to the literature with the concept of dissonant harmony-seekers, which will gain more visibility in a world where the trend of democratic decline and rising authoritarianism will motivate a migratory move for people who confront a moral dissociation from the civil order in their homeland. The engagement of dissonant harmony-seekers with migrant communities challenges the conventional thinking that social identity is central to creating and maintaining bubbles. The other contribution of the paper to the literature is the metaphor of ‚Äúfoam‚Äù to capture the ephemeral and fugacious nature of the dynamics of migrant communities and practices	['SDG16', 'SDG10']
565843302	Understanding Factors Associated with Burnout Symptoms amongst Investigators working on Rape and Serious Sexual Offence (RASSO) investigations in England and Wales	Prolonged stress leading to job-related burnout is of increasing interest in policing. Police officers involved in rape and serious sexual offences (RASSO) investigations experience heightened scrutiny alongside increased forensic demands whilst providing an accountable, victim-orientated service. The objective of the study was to examine correlates associated with burnout symptoms [emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment (PA)]. RASSO investigators (n = 538) completed a cross-sectional online survey across five police force areas in England and Wales. Measures were screened using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator method, and three regression models were run against the three outcome measures. Excessive job demands encompassing workload, work‚Äìlife balance and team pressures from colleagues and managers were strongly related to EE and DP. Male officers reported elevated levels of depersonalization. The learning climate was associated with all three burnout measures. The findings suggest that creating an effective learning environment for RASSO investigations and establishing effective organizational health policies to enhance team cohesion can reduce burnout. Further work is required to understand male officers‚Äô higher levels of depersonalization	['SDG08']
478833172	Earnings Management and Financial Reporting Fraud: Can External Auditors Spot the Difference?	The aim of this paper is to increase external auditors‚Äô knowledge about earnings management and help them spot the difference between earnings management and financial reporting fraud. A thorough literature review was undertaken to achieve the paper‚Äôs aim. The secondary data used in this paper was obtained from different databases like Ebscohost, Business Search Premier, Academic Search Premier, Emerlad, Sciencedirect, and Jstor. The current paper suggests a new approach and way of thinking for external auditors that might help them in spotting the difference between earnings management and fraud. This new approach calls for the importance of considering management‚Äôs motives which is the main driver for all fraudulent activities. A set of recommendations for external auditors, researchers, and standards‚Äô setters are provided in this paper. External auditors have to view external auditing in terms of the audit of motivations. Standards‚Äô setters should provide external auditors with more guidelines regarding the audit of management‚Äôs motives. More research is still needed in management‚Äôs motives and integrity	['SDG16', 'SDG08']
590242830	Curriculum design	Framed by notions of language and what language education aims to achieve, this chapter explores issues around curriculum design for language learning. It asks what language learners may want to communicate and to whom, and how we can establish a framework which will support the development of understanding and competencies that are relevant in a global society. The chapter looks at current practice in UK Higher Education and discusses how language curricula are influenced by trends and policies, and further shaped by documents such as the revised Common European Framework, which is now taking account of mediation skills and plurilingual practices. In a case study, it critically explores the introduction and continued development of a new curriculum framework at the UK‚Äôs largest university, The Open University, between 2014 and 2023. Key issues include static versus more process-oriented approaches to curriculum design, the integration of a wide range of skills into language curricula, ongoing discussions around ‚Äòcontent‚Äô and ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô teaching in Higher Education, and the inclusion of learners‚Äô plurilingual repertoires. The strive to ‚Äòdecolonise the curriculum‚Äô is highly pertinent for languages provisions and it seems essential to reflect on what languages are being offered and for what purpose, in what ways the field could and should be made more interdisciplinary and how diversity can be built into the curriculum itself	['SDG04']
590242828	Equity, diversity, and inclusion in open education: A systematic literature review	Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) and open education are key areas in the current development of educational systems internationally. However, little is known about the general perspective of what has been addressed about EDI in open educational contexts to date. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review of 15 papers where we examined the current state of the art and the main suggestions for EDI implementation. Results indicate that practitioners should involve all stakeholders, including institutions, faculty members, and students, in EDI development to enhance open educational practices as well as in the cocreation of open educational resources which need to consider culture, language, and location, among others. This review of literature contributes an evidence base to support the future development and adoption of EDI in open educational contexts by organizing relevant literature into coherent themes that can inform future research	['SDG04']
493194119	Ethical tension in working with stakeholders	This chapter presents a debate about the ethical tension and conflict that can arise from working with multiple and diverse stakeholders in the context of social marketing. The practice of social marketing has always involved some degree of collaboration between social marketers and a range of different stakeholders. Stakeholder interactions include building relationships with funding agencies to gather the resources needed to support social marketing programmes, working with advertising and other related agencies to develop marketing communications strategies and materials, and engaging with target audiences to understand their needs and implement citizen-centric behaviour change strategies. Responsibilities and objectives for all stakeholders need to be identified, and processes need to be established to enforce appropriate accountabilities by regulating agencies. The chapter reviews McHugh, Domegan, and Duane‚Äôs understanding of a social marketing system as ‚Äúa multiplicity of people and stakeholder groups interacting to create patterns of behaviours, choices, and values over time in a dynamic macro‚Äìmicro context‚Äù	['SDG17']
478268179	Comparing short and long-distance dispersal: Modelling and field case studies	Dispersal is a factor of great importance in determining a species spatial distribution. Short distance dispersal (SDD) and long distance dispersal (LDD) strategies yield very different spatial distributions. In this paper we compare spatial spread patterns from SDD and LDD simulations, contrast them with patterns from field data, and assess the significance of biological and population traits.Simulated SDD spread using an exponential function generates a single circular patch with a well-defined invasion front showing a travelling-wave structure. The invasive spread is relatively slow as it is restricted to reproductive individuals occupying the outer zone of the circular patch. As a consequence of this dispersal dynamics, spread is slower than spread generated by LDD. In contrast, the early and fast invasion of the entire habitat mediated by power law LDD not only involves a significantly greater invasion velocity, but also an entirely different habitat occupation. As newly dispersed individuals soon reach very distant portions of the habitat as well as the vicinity of the original dispersal focus, new growing patches are generated while the main patch increases its own growth absorbing the closest patches. As a consequence of both dispersal and lower density dependence, growth of the occupied area is much faster than with SDD.SDD and LDD also differ regarding pattern generation. With SDD, fractal patterns appear only in the border of the invasion front in SDD when competitive interaction with residents is included. In contrast, LDD patterns show fractality both in the spatial arrangements of patches as well as in patch borders. Moreover, values of border fractal dimension inform on the dispersal process in relation with habitat heterogeneity. The distribution of patch size is also scale-free, showing two power laws characteristic of small and large patch sizes directly arising from the dispersal and reproductive dynamics.Ecological factors like habitat heterogeneity are relevant for dispersal, although its importance is greater for SDD, lowering the invasion velocity. Among the life history traits considered, adult mortality, the juvenile bank and mean dispersal distance are the most relevant for SDD. For LDD, habitat heterogeneity and changes in life history traits are not so relevant, causing minor changes in the values of the scale-free parameters.Our work on short and long distance dispersal shows novel theoretical differences between SDD and LDD in invasive systems (mechanisms of pattern formation, fractal and scaling properties, relevance of different life history traits and habitat variables) that correspond closely with field examples and were not analyzed, at least in this degree of detail, by the previously existing models	['SDG15']
477971427	Luck in Food Finding Affects Individual Performance and Population Trajectories	Energy harvesting by animals is important because it provides the power needed for all metabolic processes. Beyond this, efficient food finding enhances individual fitness [1] and population viability [2], although rates of energy accumulation are affected by the environment and food distribution. Typically, differences between individuals in the rate of food acquisition are attributed to varying competencies [3], even though food-encounter rates are known to be probabilistic [4]. We used animal-attached technology to quantify food intake in four disparate free-living vertebrates (condors, cheetahs, penguins, and sheep) and found that inter-individual variability depended critically on the probability of food encounter. We modeled this to reveal that animals taking rarer food, such as apex predators and scavengers, are particularly susceptible to breeding failure because this variability results in larger proportions of the population failing to accrue the necessary resources for their young before they starve and because even small changes in food abundance can affect this variability disproportionately. A test of our model on wild animals indicated why Magellanic penguins have a stable population while the congeneric African penguin population has declined for decades.

590957740	Biographies and Careers throughout Academic Life	The book draws on the 2007 Changing Academic Profession international survey in order to document the personal characteristics, career trajectories, sense of identity/commitment and job satisfaction of academics in 14 countries with different levels of economic and social development and different higher education systems. With nearly 26,000 academics surveyed in 19 countries (of which 14 are reporting their results in this volume), the empirical basis of the book is the most up-to-date and far-reaching in the area.With major changes taking place both in the local and global contexts of higher education and in the working conditions within individual universities, as exemplified by increasing managerialism and performance-based funding, it is important to consider the impact of these changes on the profiles and working lives of the academic profession across different countries. But it is also important to look at the ways in which the faculty‚Äôs changing profile impacts on the organisation and management of universities and on the delivery of their central functions.Although not always obvious in the short-term, academic work and its conditions attract, incorporate and promote different types of individuals who, in turn, exert considerable influence on the nature of academic work, higher education institutions and, potentially, society. As faculty members are central to the teaching, research and service enterprise activities of higher education, it is important to understand their personal characteristics, career trajectories, sense of identity and commitment, and job satisfaction. These are central for understanding the academic profession in general and, in particular, the factors affecting their involvement and productivity in the work of their institutions. These are a complex result of a mixture of contextual factors (e.g. the status and regulatory framework of the higher education system, the features and atmosphere of the particular institution) and personal factors (e.g. gender, educational attainment, family background, attitudes to work and broader social values).This book examines the different situations facing the academic profession in individual countries and provides comparative studies of country differences	['SDG04', 'SDG08']
492385202	Defining the burden of febrile illness in rural South and Southeast Asia: an open letter to announce the launch of the Rural Febrile Illness project.	In rural areas of South and Southeast Asia malaria is declining but febrile illnesses still account for substantial morbidity and mortality. Village health workers (VHWs) are often the first point of contact with the formal health system, and for patients with febrile illnesses they can provide early diagnosis and treatment of malaria. However, for the majority of febrile patients, VHWs lack the training, support and resources to provide further care. Consequently, treatable bacterial illnesses are missed, antibiotics are overused and poorly targeted, and patient attendance wanes along with declining malaria. This Open Letter announces the start of a new initiative, the Rural Febrile Illness (RFI) project, the first in a series of projects to be implemented as part of the South and Southeast Asian Community-based Trials Network (SEACTN) research programme. This multi-country, multi-site project will run in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Myanmar. It will define the epidemiological baseline of febrile illness in nine remote and underserved areas of Asia where malaria endemicity is declining and access to health services is limited. The RFI project aims to determine the incidence, causes and outcomes of febrile illness; understand the opportunities, barriers and appetite for adjustment of the role of VHWs to include management of non-malarial febrile illnesses; and establish a network of community healthcare providers and facilities capable of implementing interventions designed to triage, diagnose and treat patients presenting with febrile illnesses within these communities in the future	['SDG03', 'SDG04', 'SDG10']
478268209	Death, dying, and end-of-life care	Death is often considered to be a universal life event. However, how death comes about, and is experienced, is neither certain nor equal. Attending to dying ‚Äì the process and events that lead to death ‚Äì as well as death can provide an understanding of this variability and how people make sense of it. In this chapter, the concept of ‚Äúgood death‚Äù is used to critically examine end-of-life care, assisting both life-extensions and dying, and changing mortality trends. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate some of the diversity surrounding death and dying in different contexts, and explore some of the trends that affect how deaths come to be evaluated as ‚Äúgood‚Äù. By discussing these contemporary, global issues, this chapter reveals how thinking about these issues critically illuminates that the social context of death is not as universal or equalising as it is sometimes presumed to be	['SDG03', 'SDG10']
590957737	The dynamics of interpersonal trust: implications for care at times of psychological crisis	'Trust' can describe many different positive features of our social relationships with others. In this exploratory paper, we reflect on some of the ways in which people orient themselves towards others in the context of a psychological crisis, a time when trust may be threatened or eroded. We draw upon qualitative data extracts from two previously reported studies, in order to illustrate and develop some observations about the dynamics of relational trust during such periods of acute distress. We show how these dynamics arise out of particular contexts and have particular consequences for psychological health. We discuss how, in a relationship mediated by trust, it can sometimes be an act of care - towards self, or towards others - to filter and limit the extent of what one entrusts to another. We suggest that further consideration by philosophers can be very helpful to the mental health field here, if we are to understand the negotiation of interpersonal trust in the context of mental health crises. We note that it would be extremely helpful to understand more about how to create the kinds of environments which afford trust	['SDG03']
82980850	Categorising European experience: the ForAge Project and the construction of knowledge of later-life learning	The ‚ÄòForage for Later-life Learning‚Äô Project is an EU Lifelong Learning Programme Grundtvig multi-lateral network, funded 2012-2015. Its rationales are the development of a database of knowledge on later-life learning and the use of that database as a means of promoting discussion, understanding, recognition and change in later-life learning.This article discusses the objectives and rationale of the ForAge database and considers its intended target audiences. In particular, it argues that the database became eclectic, deliberately identifying and drawing on different ‚Äúkinds‚Äù of knowledge. It shows how the main database categories, which determined how the knowledge was ‚Äúconstructed‚Äù were allowed to evolve and define themselves as the content of the database increased.The article discusses the justification and operational implications of the inclusion of material according to criteria of ‚Äúrelevance, quality and usefulness‚Äù and in both English and in other European languages.The article concludes that the database does not reveal the presence in Europe of a significant volume of fundamental research-based knowledge on later-life learning; that much of the knowledge collected is based on the presumption that later-life learning has second-order goals and that the database usefully hedges its bets on what counts as ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù in the field of later-life learning	['SDG04']
82980814	3D Virtual Field Trips as a Service (VFTaaS): Learning Design	Virtual Field Trips as a Service (VFTaaS) involves using game-based technology to enable the creation of a library of three-dimensional (3D) Virtual Field Trips (VFTs) (and other fieldwork experiences) covering multiple sites in the UK and abroad (and even off planet, such as a trip to Mars). In addition to providing access to the library, VFTaaS focuses on the pedagogical and commercial considerations to enable institutions to contribute new artefacts to the library, such as 3D locations (e.g. part of Snowdonia), or 3D simulations (e.g. model of a brain), or processes (e.g. high tides), or activities (e.g. ‚Äòsample virtual transects to gather data on species of heather‚Äô), and contribute new learning experiences (e.g. customised lesson plans) to existing materials in the library.Towards the research objectives, we investigated the following:‚Ä¢ pedagogical underpinnings of 3D virtual environments and 3D VFTs in disciplines such as geology, biology, environmental science/studies and geography which are founded on field observations, exploration and enquiry.‚Ä¢ potential of integrating VFTs within the curricula in schools and in HEIs.‚Ä¢ perceptions of educators, students and assessment bodies towards 3D VFTs, and virtual fieldwork, in general; we used the Virtual Skiddaw App in workshops and presentations to illustrate the concept of a 3D VFT.‚Ä¢ views of stakeholders towards VFTaaS and elicited the advantages, challenges with adopting VFTaaS, and their requirements for VFTaaS.The empirical investigations have been user-centred ‚Äì focussing on the stakeholders and particularly, the end-users such as educators, students and fieldwork specialists, and we have interacted with them via interviews, workshops, demonstrations and a survey to elicit their perceptions and requirements	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
360346727	Exploring the role of humans and climate over the Balkan landscape: 500 years of vegetational history of Serbia	We present the first, well-dated, high-resolution record of vegetation and landscape change from Serbia, which spans the past 500 years. Biological proxies (pollen, spores, and charcoal), geochemical analysis through X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), and a detailed chronology based on AMS 14C dating from a western Serbian sinkhole core suggest complex woodland-grassland dynamics and strong erosional signals throughout the Little Ice Age (LIA). An open landscape with prominent steppe vegetation (e.g. Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae) and minor woodland exists during 1540‚Äì1720CE (early LIA), while the late LIA (1720-1850CE) in this record shows higher tree percentages possibly due to increased moisture availability. The post LIA Era (1850‚Äì2012CE) brings a disturbed type of vegetation with the presence of weedy genera and an increase in regional woodland. Anthropogenic indicators for agricultural, pastoral and fire practices in the region together attest to the dominant role of humans in shaping this Balkan landscape throughout the interval. The changing nature of human interference, potentially as a response to underlying climatic transitions, is evident through large-scale soil depletion resulting from grazing and land clearance during the early LIA and stabilization of arable lands during the late and post-LIA eras	['SDG13', 'SDG15']
360346725	An Examination of Long-Term Environmental-Social Dynamics in the Balkans	This study examines the interactions of environmental and social dynamics in Central Balkans over the past millennium, a period that experienced three major climatic phases (Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and the warm 20th century). Meanwhile, the same period witnessed a complex human history with the emergence-rise-decline of the Ottoman Empire and subsequent socio-political events (e.g. wars, famines, migrations). Environmental datasets for the analysis include biological proxies (pollen, spores, and charcoal), geochemical signals through X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and a detailed chronology based on AMS 14C dating of two western and central Serbian lakes while social datasets include historic population data, land use, settlement patterns, and critical historic events derived from a review of the literature and local archives. Among the environmental datasets, indigenous tree and herbaceous pollen from these Central Balkans records demonstrate fluctuations in woodland-grassland dynamics whereas potassium and titanium counts obtained through XRF act as a proxy for surface erosion and clastic input into the lakes. Microscopic charcoal, cereal pollen and subordinate anthropogenic pollen (e.g. cultivated fruits and vegetables) are used to distinguish strong human impact over the landscape. These key anthropogenic indicators create a more thorough social component of the analysis in association with the social datasets. After reconstructing the individual time series for each environmental and social dataset, the two Central Balkan records are correlated in order to identify the environmental and social homogeneity and heterogeneity patterns occurring at shorter and longer timescales during the period. Results provide insights on how a region responds to social and environmental stressors and our approach demonstrates ways to integrate natural and social science system research	['SDG13', 'SDG15']

82904509	Knowledge Translation Capability and Public-Sector Innovation Processes	Public sector organisations are increasingly becoming aware of the need to harness the innovative capacity of their employees. In the UK many public sector research institutes have put in place processes to increase the speed at which new technological innovations are exploited and commercialised. These types of initiatives have also been implemented into public sector service organisations. For these service organisations innovations occur not just from formal research projects but are also practice based, developed by staff in the course of their normal work. This paper suggests that practice-based innovations can be seen as relying heavily on Mode 2 knowledge production. Using the UK‚Äôs National Health Service as an example, the characteristics of practice-based innovations are characterised as tightly coupled to their development context and combining hard and soft technologies. A model of knowledge translation capability is presented that supports Mode 2 knowledge production and is then used to analyse a case study of a practice based NHS innovation. Implications for NHS innovation policy are suggested and further areas of research into public a sector innovation processes outlined	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82904384	Methods for the microsampling and high-precision analysis of strontium and rubidium isotopes at single crystal scale for petrological and geochronological applications	Micromilling of single crystals to yield microgram-sized solid samples for subsequent isotopic analysis can yield important petrogenetic information from crystals (especially feldspars) in magmatic rocks. Exceptional detail can be gained because the textural context of the sample area can be fully evaluated before milling. Such information is otherwise unknown or lost when performing analysis at the bulk rock scale. Here we present a comprehensive methodology for the precise analysis of ng-levels of Rb and Sr purified from microgram-sized solid samples extracted from minerals in thin sections. Physical sampling techniques are based around a computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine (Micromill‚Ñ¢), newly designed specifically for the sampling of complex accretionary and growth structures in crystalline materials. Chemical procedures for the isolation of Sr and Rb for TIMS and MC-ICPMS analysis, respectively, are presented, and the performance of these analytical techniques is assessed in the context of the small sample sizes produced by micromilling. Despite being time consuming, mechanical sampling, conventional dissolution and chemical separation followed by analysis by TIMS remain the best methods for both highly accurate and precise determinations of Sr isotopic compositions in most geological materials over a wide range of Sr concentrations, Rb/Sr ratios and matrix types. Using these techniques, it is possible to achieve long-term 2 S.D. external precisions of 50 ppm for load sizes as small as 3 ng Sr. We demonstrate the validity of these techniques using two examples. The first is from a < 50 ka single feldspar crystal from Parinacota volcano (Chile) to show that 87Sr/86Sr isotope ranges as small as 0.00006 (2 √ó 2 S.D. external) can be resolved under conditions where radiogenic-Sr ingrowth can be neglected. The second is from the 28.4 Ma Fish Canyon Tuff (Colorado) to demonstrate the utility of isotope dilution measurements of Rb and Sr contents to calculate 87Rb/86Sr and thus perform age corrections to the 87Sr/86Sr ratios in order to establish 87Sr/86Sri variations between single crystals or zones. We demonstrate that biotite crystals in the Fish Canyon Tuff show Sr-isotopic variations well beyond analytical errors and hence that the crystals involved were not in isotopic equilibrium and cannot be used to establish an isochron age. On the other hand, the precision of our isotope dilution measurements may be used to obtain Rb‚ÄìSr geochronological information at the single crystal scale, provided that homogeneity in 87Sr/86Sr at the time of crystallisation can be demonstrated	['SDG09']

It points out that a mixture of motives and goals may inform screening programmes and selective termination for fetal abnormality without the intention being ‚Äúeugenic‚Äù. The paper locates modern genetics within the tradition of humanist medicine by suggesting that parents who choose to terminate a pregnancy because of fetal abnormalities are not making moral judgments about those who are living with these abnormalities already. Rather they are making judgments about their own lives and the lives of their children in relation to this genetic disorder. It concludes by introducing several caveats about the counselling that parents receive after the results of the testing and suggests that counselling inevitably contains a directive element because of the nature of the information covered	['SDG03', 'SDG10']

These algorithms are combined with parallel compilation techniques (compiler farms, compiler caches), to further reduce build time. We demonstrate through experiments their effectiveness in achieving significant speedup for both fresh and incremental builds	['SDG09']
82904345	Surface movements of emplaced lava flows measured by synthetic aperture radar interferometry	Lava flows continue to move after they have been emplaced by flow mechanisms. This movement is largely vertical and can be detected using differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. There are three main components to this motion: (1) movement of surface scatterers, resulting in radar phase decorrelation, (2) measurable subsidence of the flow surface due to thermal contraction and clast repacking, and (3) time-dependent depression of the flow substrate. These effects act in proportion to the thickness of the lava flow and decay with time, although there is a time lag before the third component becomes significant. We explore these effects using SAR data from the ERS satellites over the Etna volcano, Sicily. Phase decorrelation on young, thick a‚Äôa lava flows persists for a few years and probably results from surface block rotations during flow contraction. Maximum measured subsidence rates of the 1991‚Äì1993 lava flow over a period of 70 days are about 0.7 mm day‚àí1, but are potentially greater in areas of data decorrelation. These rates fall to <2.7√ó10‚àí2‚Äâmm day‚àí1 after about 20 years in flows about 50 m thick, sooner for thinner flows. Comparison with measured subsidence rates on Kilauean lava lakes suggests that thermal contraction only accounts for about one third of the observed subsidence. The remaining motion is thought to come from surface clast repacking during cooling and from creep mechanisms in the flow substrate. Measurements of postemplacement surface movement provide new constraints on the thermomechanical properties of lava flows and have cautionary implications for the interpretation of interferometric SAR data of volcanoes. ¬© 2001 American Geophysical Union	['SDG15', 'SDG13']
82904381	The anatomy of Continental Flood Basalt Provinces: geological constraints on the processes and products of flood volcanism	The internal architecture of the immense volumes of eruptive products in Continental Flood Basalt Provinces (CFBPs) provides vital clues, through the constraint of a chrono-stratigraphic framework, to the origins of major intraplate melting events. This work presents close examination of the internal facies architecture and structure, duration of volcanism, epeirogenetic uplift associated with CFBPs, and the potential environmental impacts of three intensely studied CFBPs (the Parana-Etendeka, Deccan Traps and North Atlantic Igneous Province). Such a combination of key volcanological, stratigraphic and chronologic observations can reveal how a CFBP is constructed spatially and temporally to provide crucial geological constraints regarding their development.Using this approach, a typical model can be generated, on the basis of the three selected CFBPs, that describes three main phases of flood basalt volcanism. These phases are recognized in Phanerozoic CFBPs globally. At the inception of CFBP volcanism, relatively low-volume transitional-alkaline eruptions are forcibly erupted into exposed cratonic basement lithologies, sediments, and in some cases, water. Distribution of initial volcanism is strongly controlled by the arrangement of pre-existing topography, the presence of water bodies and local sedimentary systems, but is primarily controlled by existing lithospheric and crustal weaknesses and concurrent regional stress patterns. The main phase of volcanism is typically characterised by a culmination of repeated episodes of large volume tholeiitic flows that predominantly generate large tabular flows and flow fields from a number of spatially restricted eruption sites and fissures. These tabular flows build a thick lava flow stratigraphy in a relatively short period of time (c. 1‚Äì5 Ma). With the overall duration of flood volcanism lasting 5‚Äì10 Ma (the main phase accounting for less than half the overall eruptive time in each specific case). This main phase or ‚Äòacme‚Äô of volcanism accounts for much of the CFBP eruptive volume, indicating that eruption rates are extremely variable over the whole duration of the CFBP. During the waning phase of flood volcanism, the volume of eruptions rapidly decrease and more widely distributed localised centres of eruption begin to develop. These late-stage eruptions are commonly associated with increasing silica content and highly explosive eruptive products. Posteruptive modification is characterised by continued episodes of regional uplift, associated erosion, and often the persistence of a lower-volume mantle melting anomaly in the offshore parts of those CFBPs at volcanic rifted margins	['SDG15', 'SDG13']

491028285	Epistemic public criminology: The fallacies of evidence-based policing	There is now widespread agreement amongst theorists and commentators that there has been a sea-change in the culture of crime control since the 1970s. New paradigms and sensibilities about the institutions of criminal justice have arisen, not least amongst those scholars who concern themselves with questions to do with the institution of statutory policing. The interplay between scientific epistemology and political intelligence continues to provide a backdrop to the contemporary public engagements of criminology. The theory of evidence-based policing assumes that there is a correct, objective analysis of risk that is superior to the knowledge police might otherwise use to resolve their information dilemmas. Community-based policing ‚Äòcapitalizes on the resources of communities to identify and control crime‚Äô and rests upon the idea that citizens can be enlisted to help ‚Äòco-produce‚Äô community safety. The fallacies of evidence-based policing arise through errors resulting from the kind of reasoning that wants to find the evidence to confirm the conclusions it has already reached	['SDG16']
186327547	The atmosphere of the ward: Attunements and attachments of everyday life for patients on a medium-secure forensic psychiatric unit	The climate or atmosphere of a ward in secure psychiatric care is typically studied by examining the relationship between social and environmental factors. However the experiences of patients are irreducible to a set of discrete dimensions or factors. Drawing on recent work in affect theory and architectural studies, we argue for an approach to atmosphere that places it ‚Äòin-between‚Äô persons and space, as a ‚Äòspatially extended quality of feeling‚Äô of which patients are intimately aware. The article discusses empirical material drawn from a broader study of inpatient medium-secure forensic care in a large hospital in the South of England. We show how the process of becoming attuned to the fluctuations and shifts in the atmosphere of the ward is a critical aspect of everyday life for patients. Attunement cuts across existing notions of power and resistance in these settings. We also demonstrate how attachments to a range of objects, some created by patients, can either expand or punctualize attunement, enabling change in the overall atmosphere. We conclude by speculating on how we might rethink spaces of recovery on an ethospheric basis	['SDG03', 'SDG16']

With the digitisation of society and industry and the progressing integration of systems, CPS need to become 'smarter' in the sense that they can adapt and learn to handle new and unexpected conditions, and improve over time. Smarter CPS present a combination of challenges that existing engineering methods have difficulties addressing: intertwined digital, physical and social spaces, need for heterogeneous modelling formalisms, demand for context-tied cooperation to achieve system goals, widespread uncertainty and disruptions in changing contexts, inherent human constituents, and continuous encounter with new situations. While approaches have been put forward to deal with some of these challenges, a coherent perspective on engineering smarter CPS is lacking. In this paper, we present six engineering principles for addressing the challenges of smarter CPS. As smarter CPS are software-intensive systems, we approach them from a software engineering perspective with the angle of self-adaptation that offers an effective approach to deal with run-time change. The six principles create an integrated landscape for the engineering and operation of smarter CPS	['SDG09']
528399559	Beginning, becoming and belonging: using liminal spaces to explore how part-time adult learners negotiate emergent identities when embarking on undergraduate online study	Using the concept of liminal spaces, this paper discusses findings from a study exploring the experiences of fifteen adults as they negotiate their identity as online learners during the first module on a part-time undergraduate degree programme. Online programmes enable adult learners with diverse backgrounds and responsibilities to choose when and how they study and therefore make decisions of how their aspirations are best met. The convenience and flexibility of these hybrid spaces enables them to take control of their learning. However, such benefits are reliant upon negotiating new ideas, technologies, constructs of learning and emergent identities which may sit at the counterpoint of existing roles, responsibilities and experiences. For some, this period of transition can consequently be characterised by disorientation and liminality. The findings presented here provide new insights into the experiences of adults who choose to study online, highlighting the extent of the entanglement between their emergent identities and personal lifeworld. I explore the interplay of the factors which shape these early encounters and, using a narrative approach, examine how identities are forged, how the opportunities and challenges presented by online spaces are negotiated, and the importance of a sense of belonging. This approach contributes to the growing field of online research methods through an innovative use of online reflective journals and Skype interviews and further extends the writing on liminality into online spaces. Although the data for this study was collected and analysed before the COVID-19 pandemic, I examine what we, as educator-researchers, can learn from these narratives and how this might inform our professional practice in the COVID-19 context	['SDG04']

The review of the literature has also taken into account brain development, attachment as well as the discipline of educational psycho-therapy.ResultsThe literature review has highlighted that unsupervised contact by adolescents when undertaken and pursued is complex and risky because of the lack of support to manage the emotional complications. Moreover, there is the added difficulty of practitioners being unable to effectively manage the nature and level of contact which may have a detrimental effect on the wellbeing of the young person, as well as leading to greater likelihood of placement disruption.  These findings coupled with the adolescent brain development go some way to explain the behaviour of adolescents in care who pursue unsupervised contact because it  is a type of strange and exciting experience which leads to communication with others in a fashion that is not hemmed in by spatial location, time or social conventions.ConclusionsChild and Family social work practitioners will need to acquire a greater understanding of mobile technologies and how they are used by adolescents in care.  Moreover, in accordance with the current literature on adolescent brain development social work practitioners will need to give greater attention to the decision-making skills of adolescents in care to ensure that an environment of ‚Äòcold cognition‚Äô is created which may promote a better understanding of choices made and the subsequent consequences.  Child and Family social work practitioners can also learn from the educational psychotherapeutic field, in particular Bomber  (2009) who identifies that the key to effective support of young people who are experiencing attachment-related difficulties is through the process of emotional scaffolding which involves demonstrating to them that they are ‚Äòkept in mind‚Äô, particularly during their numerous transitions	['SDG04']

305114233	Normalising abortion: what role can health professionals play?	Background: Despite being a common gynaecological procedure, abortion continues to be widely stigmatised. The research and medical communities are increasingly considering ways of reducing stigma, and health professionals have a role to play in normalising abortion as part of routine sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH). We sought to investigate how health professionals may normalise abortion and challenge prevailing negative sociocultural narratives.Methods: As part of the Sexuality and Abortion Stigma Study (SASS), qualitative secondary analysis was conducted on two datasets containing health professionals‚Äô accounts of providing abortion in Scotland and England. A subsample of 20 interviews were subjected to in-depth, thematic analysis.Results: Four key themes were identified in heath professionals‚Äô accounts: (1) encountering resistance to abortion from others working in SRH; (2) contending with prevailing negative sociocultural narratives of abortion; (3) enacting overt positivity towards abortion provision; and (4) presenting abortion as part of normal, routine healthcare.Conclusions: It is clear that negative attitudes toward abortion persist both inside and outside of healthcare systems, and need to be challenged in order to destigmatise those accessing and providing services. Health professionals can play a key role in normalising abortion, through the ways in which they frame their work and present abortion to women they treat, and others more widely. Our analysis suggests a key way to achieve this is by presenting abortion as part of normal, routine SRH, but that appropriate support and structural change are essential for normalisation to become embedded	['SDG03', 'SDG05']
82908935	Neglected aspects of the East Asian financial crisis	The crisis of 1997 involved a serious disruption within the financial systems of the East Asian economies. A substantial literature on the causes and results of the crisis subsequently accumulated, and while there has been a certain convergence of opinion, a number of factors appear to be consistently ignored or given insufficient attention. An attempt is made below to correct this imbalance. Attention is initially focused on some of the key influences affecting financial systems, and particular consideration is given to the influence of space. The nature, form and causes of the crisis are then examined, along with a discussion of the post-crisis recovery and the role of the state in this connection. The commentary concludes with an identification of the more important implications of the crisis and the lessons to be learnt from these	['SDG16']
82972876	Ground temperature profiles and thermal rock properties at Wairakei, New Zealand	Here we present ground temperature data from Wairakei, Taupo, New Zealand. The surface zone in this area extends to 0.5 m, while the shallow zone extends to at least 7.39 m. It is expected that the deep zone starts close to this depth and will exhibit a constant temperature of approximately 14.3¬∞C, 1‚Äì2¬∞C higher than the mean ambient temperature at this site. Shallow ground temperatures are predominantly influenced by the ambient air temperature and to a lesser extent the amount of rainfall. Modelling of the thermal waves, taking conductive and convective heat transfer into account, enables estimates of thermal diffusivity, volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity, whose mean values based on data from August 2010‚ÄìApril 2011 were 3.48 √ó 10‚àí7 m2 s‚àí1, 2.35 √ó 106 J m‚àí3 K‚àí1 and 0.89 W m‚àí1 K‚àí1 respectively. These estimates are within the same ranges as previous estimates of the thermal properties at Wairakei, although the mean values are slightly higher. This finding is consistent with the increased amount of recharge that occurred during the experimental period. Increased understanding of ground temperature and thermal rock properties is valuable for the development of low enthalpy geothermal resources as well as having applications in hydrology, agronomy and climatology	['SDG07', 'SDG09']
459156672	Environmental justice in urban greening for subtropical Asian cities: the view from Taipei	Whilst an extensive body of literature exists on the environmental justice implications of urban greening in North America, Europe and to an extent Australasia, there are fewer analogous studies for tropical zone Asian city contexts. Given increasing global interest in the potential for urban greenspace to contribute to resilience in the face of environmental change and the higher vulnerability of Asian cities to environmental shocks, this is a notable gap. In response, this paper evaluates the contours of environmental justice debates within urban greenspace planning for one subtropical Asian city‚ÄîTaipei. Through analysis of newspaper reporting on urban greenspace planning within Taipei, the potential and limitations of greenspace planning in contributing to equitably delivering benefits from urban greenspace towards resilience are assessed. Findings suggest that claims to environmental injustice in greenspace debates within Taipei follow broadly similar lines to controversies in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, the need for specific knowledge to understand the different ecosystem services provided by tropical zone ecosystems, and the potential for conflicts over greenspace versus development to be heightened in dense Asian city settings, are highlighted as potential areas where environmental justice debates in an Asian urban greening context may differ from Western cities	['SDG11', 'SDG15']
459156484	Experiences of teachers who have engaged their classrooms in citizen science activities	Despite the current focus on understanding what and how young people learn when participating in Citizen Science (CS) activities, teachers‚Äô involvement and experience have received less attention. This study explored the experiences of teachers who have engaged their classrooms in CS activities. The main findings from 56 survey responses and 11 interviews indicate that teachers‚Äô motivations are mainly to improve their professional development, to communicate with scientists and researchers, and to develop students‚Äô skills and knowledge. Teachers engage in many types of CS projects and initiate collaborative activities with local and other science groups, universities, and other schools. Teachers use a range of teaching approaches such as hands-on experience, linking curriculum to daily life, collaborative learning, and parental engagement. Challenges that teachers confront include institutional bureaucracy, limited resources, and lack of student motivation. Insights from this study contribute to raising awareness of CS projects and designing more engaging activities for classrooms	['SDG04']
82904380	Did Paleogene North Atlantic rift-related eruptions drive early Eocene climate cooling?	The delivery of volcanogenic sulphur into the upper atmosphere by explosive eruptions is known to cause significant temporary climate cooling. Therefore, phreatomagmatic and phreatoplinian eruptions occurring during the final rifting stages of active flood basalt provinces provide a potent mechanism for triggering climate change.During the early Eocene, the northeast Atlantic margin was subjected to repeated ashfall for 0.5 m.y. This was the result of extensive phreatomagmatic activity along 3000 km of the opening northeast Atlantic rift. These widespread, predominantly basaltic ashes are now preserved in marine sediments of the Balder Formation and its equivalents, and occur over an area extending from the Faroe Islands to Denmark and southern England. These ash-bearing sediments also contain pollen and spore floras derived from low diversity forests that grew in cooler, drier climates than were experienced either before or after these highly explosive eruptions. In addition, coeval plant macrofossil evidence from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, also shows a comparable pattern of vegetation change. The coincidence of the ashes and cooler climate pollen and spore floras in northwest Europe identifies volcanism as the primary cause of climate cooling. Estimates show that whilst relatively few phreatomagmatic eruptive centres along the 3000 km opening rift system could readily generate 0.5‚Äì1 ¬∞C cooling, on an annual basis, only persistent or repeated volcanic phases would have been able to achieve the long-term cooling effect observed in the floral record. We propose that the cumulative effect of repeated Balder Formation eruptions initiated a biodiversity crisis in the northeast Atlantic margin forests. Only the decline of this persistent volcanic activity, and the subsequent climatic warming at the start of the Eocene Thermal Maximum allowed the growth of subtropical forests to develop across the region	['SDG13']
82904356	Higher Education and the Knowledge Society: issues, challenges and responses in Norway and Germany	This paper investigates how employers and university leaders in two very different countries, Germany and Norway, are responding to the challenges imposed by the global knowledge economy and the 1999 Bologna Declaration. It asks: Does society need more or fewer graduates? What competencies do employers expect of their graduate workers? How do higher education institutions perceive their responsibility towards the employability of their graduates? Both countries offer the opportunity to illustrate responses to shared challenges. From a comparative perspective a number of issues have emerged. In Germany, the country‚Äôs federal structure with divided responsibilities remains a cause of frustration. Reforms are slow and laden with complexities. Norway‚Äôs centralised system of higher education, on the other hand, and the availability of resources, has eased higher education reforms but not anxieties about the country‚Äôs economic future ‚Äòonce the oil runs out‚Äô. However, the successes of two mass higher education systems built on Humboldtian traditions are also discussed	['SDG08']
82975756	Introduction: Cultural work, time and trajectory	[About the book]In recent years, cultural work has engaged the interest of scholars from a broad range of social science and humanities disciplines. The debate in this ‚Äòturn to cultural work‚Äô has largely been based around evaluating its advantages and disadvantages: its freedoms and its constraints, its informal but precarious nature, the inequalities within its global workforce, and the blurring of work‚Äìlife boundaries leading to ‚Äòself-exploitation‚Äô.While academic critics have persuasively challenged more optimistic accounts of ‚Äòconverged‚Äô worlds of creative production, the critical debate on cultural work has itself leant heavily towards suggesting a profoundly new confluence of forces and effects. Theorizing Cultural Work instead views cultural work through a specifically historicized and temporal lens, to ask: what novelty can we actually attach to current conditions, and precisely what relation does cultural work have to social precedent? The contributors to this volume also explore current transformations and future(s) of work within the cultural and creative industries as they move into an uncertain future.This book challenges more affirmative and proselytising industry and academic perspectives, and the pervasive cult of novelty that surrounds them, to locate cultural work as an historically and geographically situated process. It will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology, cultural studies, human geography, urban studies and industrial relations, as well as management and business studies, cultural and economic policy and development, government and planning	['SDG11']
82978073	A research paradigm for systems agriculture.	Commencing in the late 19708 a multidisciplinary group of staff at Hawkesbury Agricultural College embarked on what we now understand as an Action Research Project. Our experiences of agriculture in Australia, UK, Asia, Africa and South America convinced us that agriculture is a complicated human activity involving uncertainty and change. From our interactions with farmers and employers across the agricultural sector we increasingly believed that our graduates were not being sufficiently equipped to cope with this complexity and change - to be professional agriculturalists for the twenty-first century (Macadam and Bawden 1985). We were also conscious ofDahlberg's (1979) assertion that the 'conceptual maps that most people have of agriculture fail to recognise it as the basic interface between people and their environments.'We decided to investigate ways of learning about how to improve problem situations in agriculture. This required the development of insights into the learning-problem-solving- research process, which we elucidate subsequently. Through this process we have come to view problems as 'things that never disappear utterly and that cannot be solved once and for all' (Lakoff and Johnson 1980) in contrast to the present widely held view of problems as puzzles for which, typically, there is a correct solution. To convey this meaning we use here the phrase 'improve problem situations' rather than 'solve problems.'In this paper we will first outline the conditions in Australian agriculture that led us to decide to adopt a systems approach at Hawkesbury, which we are calling systems agriculture.We will follow this with an outline of the methodologies of the approach and relate these to a psychology of learning. For debate during the workshop, we will present our perception of the relative position of systems agriculture in the spectrum of systems approaches to research in agriculture and postulate a model of influences on their evolution. Finally, we will outline our views on the application of systems agriculture in researching complex problem situations in agriculture	['SDG02', 'SDG09']
586542078	The Development and Validation of the Relational Depth Frequency Scale	Background: Relational depth is defined as ‚Äòa state of profound contact and engagement between two people, in which each person is fully real with the Other, and able to understand and value the other‚Äôs experiences at a high level‚Äô (Mearns and Cooper, 2005, p. xii). The concept emerged in humanistic therapies and became an area of interest in research on the therapeutic relationship. Evidence suggests relational depth may be associated to psychological growth and therapy outcome. The Relational Depth Inventory (Wiggins, 2007) provided a first instrument to measure presence of relational depth in a significant event. To this day there is no validated instrument to measure the frequency of relational depth in therapy.Aims: The principal aim of this project is to develop and validate a scale that can reliably measure the frequency of relational depth in therapy. Other aims include explorations of the demographic moderators of the frequency of relational depth.Methods: Standard procedures included the creation of an item pool, expert rating of items, and Three-Step Test interviews. A psychometric exploration was used to assess internal consistency in a sample of 556 clients and therapists, convergent validity with the RDI and WAI-SR, divergent validity with a measure of self-compassion, a principal component analysis, and associations in demographic variables.Findings and further research: The 20-item Relational Depth Frequency Scale (RDFS) has excellent reliability in this sample and good initial construct validity. We uncovered two dimensions of relational depth: enduring relational depth and intense moments of relational depth. Therapists had higher relational depth frequency (RDF) than clients. Qualified practitioners had higher RDF than trainees. Individuals who self-identified as spiritual had higher RDF than those who self-identified as atheists. Therapists had higher RDF the longer the therapy was. Clients showed lower RDF between the sixth and twenty-fourth session. The RDFS can be used for further research, particularly in assessing the predictive validity of relational depth on outcome.</br	['SDG03', 'SDG04']

82910418	Lecturers' everyday writing as professional practice in the university as workplace: new insights into academic identities	This paper reports on an investigation into the workplace writing of university lecturers as a significant element of their professional practice. The research has focused on lecturers' routine, everyday writing, as opposed to their more prestigious or scholarly writing. In order to gain an understanding of writing as professional practice, about 30 lecturers in three different UK universities have been interviewed, focusing on a small number of their everyday workplace documents, chosen by the participants themselves. This reflected a particular perspective on written documents in the university workplace - namely, that they actually instantiate practice rather than merely carry along meaning. The paper discusses some of the substantive, methodological and theoretical ideas emerging from the research. It is argued that the focus on lecturers' experience of producing and working with workplace documents in specific institutional contexts suggests new ways of framing the relationship between academic practice and academic identities, as textual, communicative and situated. This in turn has important implications for the way academic development is conceptualised	['SDG04']
82910405	Re-purposing for open education: evolving roles, responsibilities and processes	This paper explores processes designed to support large-scale re-purposing for an open education repository. The context for the discussion is provided by OpenLearn, the Open Content Initiative of the UK Open University (UKOU). OpenLearn is a major initiative funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation that aims to repurpose several thousand study-hours of existing UKOU learning materials. A core challenge for OpenLearn has been to establish an appropriate context to enable re-purposing of learning resources written primarily for print. The response to this challenge has been to create a streamlined production structure to support a team including media, editorial and academic staff. This is, however, distinct from the structure that supports course development in the institution. Indeed, a variety of ongoing changes within the university suggest that OpenLearn constitutes, amongst other possibilities, a site for experimentation and trialling of new ways of working that question established roles and responsibilities. The discussion revolves around a comparison of graphical schemes created to represent the production processes, which undergo periodic reviews. In suggesting that the project appears to be fostering a re-evaluation of professional jurisdiction boundaries, this paper investigates aspects of that venture that may also challenge the very nature and purposes of education	['SDG04']

This chapter explores recent developments in Brazil - a large scale laboratory, around teacher quality and teacher development	['SDG04']
82975962	Arthropod abundance and diversity in a lowland tropical forest floor in Panama: the role of habitat space vs. nutrient concentrations	Tropical forest floor characteristics such as depth and nutrient concentrations are highly heterogeneous even over small spatial scales and it is unclear how these differences contribute to patchiness in forest floor arthropod abundance and diversity. In a lowland tropical forest in Panama we experimentally increased litter standing crop by removing litter from five plots (L-) and adding it to five other plots (L+); we had five control plots. After 32 mo of treatments we investigated how arthropod abundance and diversity were related to differences in forest floor physical (mass, depth, water content) and chemical properties (pH, nutrient concentrations). Forest floor mass and total arthropod abundance were greater in L+ plots compared with controls. There were no treatment differences in nutrient concentrations, pH or water content of the organic horizons. Over all plots, the mass of the fermentation horizon (Oe) was greater than the litter horizon (Oi); arthropod diversity and biomass were also greater in the Oe horizon but nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in the Oi horizon. Arthropod abundance was best explained by forest floor mass, while arthropod diversity was best explained by phosphorus, calcium and sodium concentrations in the Oi horizon and by phosphorus concentrations in the Oe horizon. Differences in arthropod community composition between treatments and horizons correlated with phosphorus concentration and dry mass of the forest floor. We conclude that at a local scale, arthropod abundance is related to forest floor mass ( habitat space), while arthropod diversity is related to forest floor nutrient concentrations (habitat quality)	['SDG15']
82910313	What constitutes transgressive sex? The case of child prostitution in Thailand	"About the book: Sex is often regarded as a dangerous business that must be rigorously controlled, regulated, and subjected to rules. Sexual acts that defy acceptable practices may be seen as variously defiling, immoral, and even unnatural. They may challenge and subvert both cultural preconceptions and the social order in a politics of sexual transgression that threatens to radically transform permissible boundaries and restructure bodily engagements. This collection of essays explores acts of sexual transgression that have the power to reconfigure perceptions of bodily intimacy and the social norms of interaction. Considering issues such as domestic violence, child prostitution, health and sex, teenage sex, and sex with animals across a range of settings from contemporary Oceania, the Pacific, South Africa, and southeast Asia to Euro-America, this book should interest all those who question the ""naturalness"" of sex, including public health workers, clinical practitioners and students of sex, sexuality, and gender in the humanities and social sciences"	['SDG05', 'SDG16']
82978080	Systems methodologies for sustainable natural resources research and development.	Systems methodologies are helping to reshape the way in which natural resource Research and Development (R&D) is conducted but they are under-utilised and under-researched. This paper outlines some recent trends in systems thinking, and argues the case for the use and further development of systems methodologies for research and development in sustainable natural resource management (NRM R&D). Systems, or complexity, research reveals the inadequacy of development projects which are based on blueprints and certainty derived from linear projections into the future. Two strands of NRM R&D are explored: farming systems research (FSR) and systems learning. Both have been extended from farming to rural livelihood and food systems. This improves their holistic claims but increases demands on them. FSR acknowledges that both natural and socio-economic science are necessary to NRM but has had limited success in synthesising them. The systems learning strand is increasingly apparent but is still under-researched despite successes. Research to further adapt and develop systems methodologies in NRM contexts is identified	['SDG02', 'SDG12']
82901564	Paracrine relationships between adipose and lymphoid tissues: implications for the mechanism of HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome	Paracrine interactions between lymphoid cells and adipocytes surrounding lymph nodes improve the efficiency of immune responses by emancipating activated lymphoid cells from competition with other tissues for blood-borne nutrients. HIV infection may disrupt this relationship, causing lipodystrophy.The adipocytes anatomically associated with lymph nodes and omental milky spots have site-specific properties that equip them to interact locally with lymphoid cells. Paracrine provisioning of peripheral immune responses improves their efficiency and emancipates activated lymphocytes from competition with other tissues for blood-borne nutrients.  Prolonged disruption to such paracrine interactions may contribute to the HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome, causing selective hypertrophy of the mesentery, omentum and other adipose depots that contain much activated lymphoid tissue	['SDG03']
586542112	Politics and applied linguistics	For the discipline of applied linguistics, political issues have always been a central concern, whether they are addressed implicitly or explicitly. If we take Brumfit‚Äôs definition of applied linguistics as the ‚Äòinvestigation of real-world problems in which language is a central issue‚Äô (1995: 27), it becomes inevitable that, assuming we believe that the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô is intrinsically political, the discipline itself needs to address issues of power. In this chapter, I examine three main issues concerning the relationship between politics and language. The first focuses on politics about language - the way that (ideas about) language, particular languages, and language use become the site for political debate and struggle. The second is politics enacted through language - the ways that language use itself achieves or is subject to political effects. And the third examines the ways in which applied linguistics is relevant specifically to electoral politics - how insights from linguistics can be applied to the analysis, or even the practice, of political engagement, especially in the context of electoral or party politics	['SDG16']

However, reliance of biosensors on batteries has serious drawbacks. Although the human body energy can be converted into electricity with energy harvesters. Hybridization of multiple energy harvesters is a prominent trend to increase the power output. In this work a hybrid piezoelectric and reverse electrowetting (REWOD) energy harvester is proposed. The main principle of working is based on the presence of electrical double layer in REWOD component and the coupling with a piezoelectric nanogenerator via an electret. The proposed energy harvester design was tested numerically and in a series of experiments	['SDG03', 'SDG09']
188345840	Learning analytics at the intersections of student trust, disclosure and benefit	Evidence suggests that individuals are often willing to exchange personal data for (real or perceived) benefits. Such an exchange may be impacted by their trust in a particular context and their (real or perceived) control over their data.Students remain concerned about the scope and detail of surveillance of their learning behavior, their privacy, their control over what data are collected, the purpose of the collection, and the implications of any analysis. Questions arise as to the extent to which students are aware of the benefits and risks inherent in the exchange of their data, and whether they are willing to exchange personal data for more effective and supported learning experiences.This study reports on the views of entry level students at the Open University (OU) in 2018. The primary aim is to explore differences between stated attitudes to privacy and their online behaviors, and whether these same attitudes extend to their university's uses of their (personal) data. The analysis indicates, inter alia, that there is no obvious relationship between how often students are online or their awareness of/concerns about privacy issues in online contexts and what they actually do to protect themselves. Significantly though, the findings indicate that students overwhelmingly have an inherent trust in their university to use their data appropriately and ethically.Based on the findings, we outline a number of issues for consideration by higher education institutions, such as the need for transparency (of purpose and scope), the provision of some element of student control, and an acknowledgment of the exchange value of information in the nexus of the privacy calculus.</p	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82901986	A Heat flow and physical properties package for the surface of Mercury	European Space Agencies fifth cornerstone mission BepiColombo includes a ‚ÄòSurface Element‚Äô to land a scientific payload on the surface of Mercury. The current strawman payload includes a heat flow and physical properties package (HP3), focussing on key thermal and mechanical properties of the near-surface material (down to a depth of 2‚Äì5 m) and the measurement of heat flow from Mercury's interior, an important constraining parameter for models of the planet's interior and evolution. We present here an overview of the HP3 experiment package and its possible accommodation in a self-inserting ‚Äòmole‚Äô device. A mole is considered to be the most appropriate deployment method for HP3, at least in the currently-assumed case of an airbag-assisted soft landing architecture for the Mercury Surface Element	['SDG09']

This commitment was explicitly taken to enhance accessibility and sustainability in terms of the project community, and to support broader public value	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
155776638	Family relationships and troubled masculinities: the experience of young men in contact with care and welfare services	This chapter draws on the findings of a study exploring gender ¬≠identities and practices in work with young men using social care services to present an account of young men's family relationships that resists the reductive generalisations that, we would argue, characterise much current debate. It discusses the broader implications for an understanding of the lives of vulnerable boys and young men. Moreover, for some young men, the continuity of family ties, and in some cases starting new families of their own, formed an important part of how they envisaged their futures. Troubled or disrupted family relationships have often been a key factor in the problems that young men have faced growing up. The relationships that vulnerable or 'at risk' young men have with their fathers are often deeply ambivalent, while in many cases mothers and grandmothers play a vital stabilising role in young men's lives	['SDG10', 'SDG16']
82901939	Clientelism in the building of state and civil society in Spain	About the book: This book charts the evolution of clientelist practices in several western European countries. Through the historical and comparative analysis of countries as diverse as Sweden and Greece, England and Spain, France and Italy, Iceland and the Netherlands, the authors study both the ‚Äòsupply-side‚Äô - the institutional context in which party leaders devise and implement their political strategies - and the ‚Äòdemand-side‚Äô - the degree of ‚Äòempowerment‚Äô of civil society - of clientelism. This approach contends that clientelism is a particular mix of particularism and universalism, in which interests are aggregated at the level of the individual and his family ‚Äòparticularism‚Äô, but in which all interests can potentially find expression and accommodation ‚Äòuniversalism‚Äô. In contrast, ‚Äòconsociationalism‚Äô and ‚Äòcorporatism‚Äô are systems of interest representation in which interests are aggregated at the level of ‚Äòsocial pillar‚Äô or the functional association ‚Äòuniversalism‚Äô, but in which not all interests can find representation and accommodation ‚Äòparticularism‚Äô.‚Ä¢ Presents clientelism and patronage as political strategies ‚Ä¢ Applies a historical /comparative approach to Western Europe ‚Ä¢ Engages the past and future of democratic interests representation	['SDG16']
82901895	From one-off events to learning systems and communities of practice	This paper considers some of the challenges and skills involved in designing and facilitating events such as workshops, meetings and conferences as part of learning systems and Communities of Practice.  It focuses mainly on processes of learning that involve interaction rather than on solitary activity, although acknowledges the relationships between individual and group levels.  Three exampls from the author's experience are presented, two from the contexts of environmental decision-making and rural change in the UK and one from direct involvement in an event that focused on Communities of Practice (CoPs) at international level.  Three inter-related areas of challenge for learning system design emerged from this enquiry and are discussed.  These areas are distribution with respect to cognition and communities; the need to take account of different systems of interest, timeframes and purposes; and the need for continuity in dialogue to support the learning of both individuals and groups	['SDG04']
82902015	Deleterious effects of a cafeteria diet on the livers of non-obese rats	Rats were fed from weaning on three diets. Those fed a cafeteria diet had livers that were enlarged and abnormal by visual inspection. The rats themselves appeared healthy, had a normal growth rate and were not significantly different in weight from control animals. Histological examination revealed the livers of these rats to be rich in lipids and glycogen. Liver function tests showed a depressed level of alanine transaminase and an abnormal HDL: LDL. Dietary lipids generate free radicals which can interact with, and damage, DNA. However, when DNA was extracted from the livers and examined for the presence of the adduct M1-dG, there were no significant differences in adduct levels in livers from animals fed any of the diets. We conclude that the cafeteria diet can have long term adverse effects on liver function even though overt measures of health may be unimpaired, body mass maintained within normal limits, and liver DNA not adversely affected	['SDG03']

478547528	Participatory Sensing: Recruiting Bipedal Platforms or Building Issue-centred Projects?	This paper raises questions about the way in which participation and recruitment are framed within participatory sensing. The text outlines a number of assumptions of participatory sensing and using a case study, examines the impacts of these assumptions on the practices of participatory sensing. The case study involves a mobile phone app that monitors ambient sound levels and creates noise maps. The study describes the conceptual and practical challenges of recruiting people and the need for an issue-centred campaign that encases the app inside a wider framework of local environmental issues. Based on observations from the case study, the paper proposes a pragmatic approach to sensing that focuses on designing sensing assemblages that support local issues of public concern. The paper argues that an issue-centred approach enables sensing that allows both machines and humans to participate in an equitable way that maximises their unique sensing abilities	['SDG03', 'SDG11']

467106823	Making sense of online discussions: can automated reports help?	Enabling healthier online deliberation around issues of public concerns is an increasingly vital challenge in nowadays society. Two fundamental components of a healthier deliberation are: i. the capability of people to make sense of what they read, so that their contribution can be relevant; and ii. the improvement of the overall quality of the debate, so that noise can be reduced and useful signals can inform collective decision making. Platform designers often resort to computational aids to improve these two processes. In this paper, we examine automated reporting as promising mean of improving sensemaking in discussion platforms. We compared three approaches to automated reporting: an abstractive summariser, a template report and an argumentation highlighting system. We then evaluated improvements in sensemaking of participants and the perception on overall quality of the debate. The study suggests that argument mining technologies are particularly promising computational aids to improve sense making and perceived quality of online discussion, thanks to their capability to combine computational models for automated reasoning with users‚Äô cognitive needs and expectation of automated reporting	['SDG16']
82904095	Combining reflective logs with electronic networks for professional development among distance education tutors	The provision of a professional development programme for distance tutors can be problematic because of the need for flexibility to cater for a variety of working practices, or to overcome the hurdles imposed by geographical remoteness. At the UK Open University, online networks are widely in use for teaching and learning, and we are actively exploring their potential for professional development. This paper describes the Supporting Open Learners in A Changing Environment project, which has piloted a reflective approach to professional development using a log to structure reflection, which is then shared with others in a computer conference. Our evaluation of tutors' perspectives of the project indicated that all participants found the experience stimulating and helpful for identifying and sharing issues of student support, although some found the process unexpectedly time consuming. We believe there is considerable potential for such an approach to networked reflection among distance tutors, provided the issue of tutor time can be addressed	['SDG04']
369424230	Gender Lens Investing in the African Context	African women face serious constraints in obtaining credit, cultivating business networks, when dealing with cultural norms that favor men, and with gender-neutral policies. This has led to calls for breaking stereotypes of women as survivalist entrepreneurs through Gender Lens Investing (GLI) initiatives. This chapter investigates the practice of GLI by analyzing how Fund managers draw on the gender lens narrative to break down gender stereotypes through the provision of microcredit, to develop women entrepreneurs‚Äô agency, and attract investments. Through the analysis of the gender lens narrative of Impact Investing Funds in Africa and two in-depth case studies of microfinance organizations in Ghana and Cameroon, this chapter reveals explicit and implicit GLI strategies for investing in women-owned businesses in resource-scarce contexts and adds to the sustainable finance research by analyzing the application of GLI in Africa. The cases highlight important policy and practice implications facing gender lens investors seeking to address the persistent gender inequalities in access to entrepreneurial finance	['SDG05', 'SDG08', 'SDG09']
82900947	The future of inter-organisational system linkages: findings of an International Delphi Study	To perform effectively in markets that are becoming increasingly turbulent and volatile, organisations should form information system linkages with their business partners. This study seeks to produce a 'vision' for the future of such linkages. A number of recent developments in information systems and technology (IS/IT) appear to promise the ability to make improvements in this domain. These are electronic hubs, web services, widespread adoption of common enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and enterprise portals. This study, which is carried out by means of the Delphi technique, explores the expected future role and use of these information systems. The expert participants in the study believe that the focus of enterprise systems is shifting from an internal to an external orientation. They suggest that ERP systems may be reaching a structural limit concerning their capabilities and adjunct technologies will be required to integrate multiple inter-organisational operations. The participants expect that the three other systems and technologies considered can provide those necessary adjunct technologies, either used singly, or more likely in combination. Finally, we find that the transition to a greater external orientation is expected to include an extension in the types of organisations that will be integrated electronically into networks	['SDG09']

82900808	Punishing parents for the crimes of their children	In recent years there has been a profusion of laws that punish parents for their children's offences. These parental responsibility laws are based on the assumption that parents of children who offend have not accepted their responsibility and that they can be made to do so by the imposition of court orders and financial penalties. In this article I will examine the efficacy of punishing parents for the crimes of their children. I will consider whether parental responsibility laws are an effective means of tackling youth crime; or should policies that strengthen the family and improve parenting skills be pursued as strategies for preventing juvenile offending behaviour	['SDG16']
82900879	Local knowledge and the strategy of constructing advantage: the role of community alliances	Economic growth is local. Communities drive the prosperity of nations. They attract and retain foreign direct investment and creative, talented, people. Institutions are key, from government labs, firms (small and large), universities, agencies providing community services ‚Äì including safe schools, health services, athletic facilities such as running and biking tracks ‚Äì and so on. This paper takes these observations, moves conceptually beyond Ricardian ''comparative advantage'' and neo-Porterian ''competitive advantage'' and ‚Äì using new information from a number of cities ‚Äì develops the notion of ''constructed advantage''	['SDG17', 'SDG08']
237022630	Interactional closeness in service calls to Montevidean carer service company	"In this article, I explore aspects of the interactional behavior of Uruguayans in nonemergency service calls to a ""carer service company,"" an institutional context characteristic of contemporary Uruguay. I do so by presenting an overview of the recurrent features found in the openings of calls where a client's next of kin phones a carer service company to a request a carer on behalf of the client. In the first part of the article, I examine the structure of the openings in the light of previous research carried out in this area on English service calls and on an analysis of a small sample of Uruguayan ordinary calls. The findings reveal that they unfold in distinguishable sequences, namely, summons-answer, identification-recognition, and the reason for the call. In this respect, they show a similar pattern to that identified in English service calls. However, unlike English service calls and the Uruguayan ordinary calls examined here, the service calls of this study exhibit a high incidence of greetings and self-identification by the call taker during the initial sequences. In the second part of the article, I investigate the pragmatic function(s) of these verbal elements within the turns of the openings. Specifically, I provide an analysis of greetings and self-identification given that, strictly speaking, they are unnecessary for the transaction to be achieved. The results indicate that their presence shows an orientation toward interactional closeness in transactional calls between conversational participants who are not familiar with each other. The observed interactional closeness in otherwise neutral/formal institutional talk is explained by the participants' orientation toward association or interdependence and by the callers' strategic aim of ensuring a good service given the general quality of services offered by the company and the level of consumer rights in Uruguay"	['SDG11']
131316757	Financial repression and liability of foreignness in developing countries	Using non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis, this paper suggests that the era of financial repression in developing countries, by providing policy-induced competitive advantages to domestic banks, may create liability of foreignness for foreign banks that impeded their resource utilization. Implementation of financial liberalization programme, which endeavours to create a more market-oriented financial sector, may enable foreign banks to overcome the liability of foreignness and enhance their resource utilization	['SDG17', 'SDG10']
571618885	The importance of Phobos simulants: a review on our current knowledge	Phobos, a satellite of Mars, was successfully studied by flyby, orbiter, and landing missions to the Red Planet, but several questions remain about its origin, composition, and relationship to Mars. It is suggested that Phobos is either a captured body from the asteroid belt or the outer Solar System (capture scenario), or a consequence of re-accreted ejecta from Mars (in situ formation/giant impact). So far, Phobos has been characterized by its two spectral units - blue and red - with different compositional restrains. The red unit represents most of the surface, while the blue unit is focused on the Stickney crater and surroundings. In the absence of samples returned from this satellite, simulant regolith must be studied to infer various proprieties, and complement in situ studies. To date, there are three simulants of this satellite: Phobos-1C, Phobos Captured Asteroid-1 (PCA-1), and Phobos Giant Impact-1 (PGI-1). Since Phobos may have a Mars-like composition, terrestrial analogues of Mars should also be analysed. The data retrieved from the various assays performed with these planetary field analogues may be used as a database to complement future space missions to Phobos, but, ultimately, the composition of Phobos will have to be analysed by a sample-return mission	['SDG09']

523283202	Piezoelectric biosensors for biorecognition analysis: Application to the kinetic study of HIV-1 Vif protein binding to recombinant antibodies	In this work three piezoelectric sensors modified with anti-HIV-1 Vif (virion infectivity factor) single fragment antibodies (4BL scFV), single domains (VH) and camelized single domains (VHD) were constructed and used to detect HIV1 Vif in liquid samples. Dithio-bis-succinimidyl-undecanoate (DSU) and 11-hydroxy-1-undecanethiol (HUT) mixed self assembled monolayers (SAM) were generated at the sensors surface onto which the antibodies were immobilized. All sensors detected specifically the target HIV1-Vif antigen in solution and no unspecific binding was monitored. Impedance analysis was performed to quantify electroacoustic and viscoelastic interferences during antibody immobilization and antigen recognition. The elimination of such interferences enabled the quantitative use of the piezoelectric immunosensors to estimate the antibody surface density as well as antigen binding and equilibrium constants. In spite of the possible limitation regarding mass transport and other related molecular phenomena, which were not considered in the binding model used, this work demonstrates the usefulness of piezoelectric biosensors in biorecognition analysis and evidences the advantages on using simultaneous impedance analysis to bring analytical significance to measured data, and thus to improve piezoelectric sensors sensitivity and applicability	['SDG03', 'SDG09']

82971927	R&D, patents and stock return volatility	Recent finance literature highlights the role of technological change in increasing firm specific (idiosyncratic) and aggregate stock return volatility, yet innovation data is not used in these analyses, leaving the direct relationship between innovation and stock return volatility untested. The paper investigates the relationship between volatility and innovation using firm level patent data. The analysis builds on the empirical work by Mazzucato (2002; 2003) where it is found that stock return volatility is highest during periods in the industry life-cycle when innovation is the most ‚Äòradical‚Äô. In this paper we ask whether firms which invest more in innovation (more R&D and more patents) and/or which have more important innovations (patents with more citations) experience more volatility in their returns.  Given that returns should in theory be higher, on average, for higher risk stocks, we also look at the effect of innovation on the level of returns. To take into account the competition between firms within industries, firm returns and volatility are measured relative to the industry average. We focus the analysis on firms in the pharmaceutical industry between 1974 and 1999. Results suggest that there is a positive and significant relationship between volatility, R&D intensity and the various patent related measures‚Äîespecially when the innovation measures are filtered to distinguish the very innovative firms from the less innovate ones	['SDG09']
82923210	Three-dimensional synaptic ultrastructure in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal area CA3 in the Ts65Dn mouse model of down syndrome	Down syndrome (DS) results from trisomy of human chromosome 21. Ts65Dn mice are an established model for DS and show several phenotypes similar to those in people with DS. However, there is little data on the structural plasticity of synapses in the trisynaptic pathway in the hippocampus. Here we investigate three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructure of synapses in the hippocampus of age-matched control (2N) and Ts65Dn male mice. Serial ultrathin sections and 3D reconstructions characterize synapses in the middle molecular layer (MML) of dentate gyrus and in thorny excrescences (TEs) in proximal portions of apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. 3D analysis of synapses shows phenotypes that distinguish Ts65Dn from 2N mice. For the MML, synapse density was reduced by 15% in Ts65Dn vs. 2N mice (P < 0.05). Comparative 3D analyses demonstrate a significant decrease in the number of thorns per TE in CA3 in Ts65Dn vs. 2N mice (by ‚àº45%, P = 0.01). Individual thorn volume was 3 times smaller in Ts65Dn vs. 2N mice (P = 0.02). A significant decrease in the number of thorn projections per TE in Ts65Dn vs. 2N mice was accompanied by a decrease of filopodium-like protrusions on the surface of TEs (P = 0.02). However, the volume of postsynaptic densities in CA3 Ts65Dn and 2N mice was unchanged (P = 0.78). Our findings suggest that the high degree of plasticity of CA3 thorns may be connected with their filopodial origin. Alterations of 3D synaptic structure in Ts65Dn mice may further contribute to the diminished plasticity in DS	['SDG03']
82976647	Regina Jonas: forgetting and remembering the first female rabbi	Regina Jonas (1902‚Äì44), who was ordained in Germany in 1935, is now widely recognised as the world‚Äôs first female rabbi. However, for almost 50 years after her death at Auschwitz in 1944, she was given very little, if any, public recognition. Based on archival research, interviews and critical engagement with secondary literature, this paper investigates a range of explanations why Jonas was nearly lost to historiography. It also considers the circumstances of the rediscovery of this controversial figure in the early 1990s and explores how she is remembered today. This paper raises important issues in relation to historiography and the connection between processes of remembering, forgetting and identity formation, particularly in relation to the history of the ordination of female rabbis and the history of Jewish communities in Germany	['SDG05', 'SDG10']

Stories made by children with Our Story are by default multimodal and open-ended and are ready to be created and shared across time and space boundaries. As such, the stories epitomise the intimate relationship between content and form and the multitude of possible ways into literacy. We conclude by highlighting the need for fostering a balanced approach when it comes to children's use of Our Story and new technologies more generally	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
598036564	Towards a systems-based framework for understanding the diffusion of technology: A case study of a modest technological innovation in the multi-agency context of policing	Technological innovation in policing is being given greater emphasis.  In public discourse about technology and policing, there is often a focus on large-scale projects that are known to fail, sometimes at significant cost.  The implementation of smaller innovations are often overlooked.  This thesis examines practice of innovation and adoption in the context of multi-agency working. The literature review in this thesis reveals that little is known about contexts where decision making does not rest with the police and exposes potential limitations in the use of diffusion and adoption frameworks/models.  The research question is: In the context of multi-agency diffusion and adoption of a technology to enhance policing, can systems thinking techniques enhance, or even replace, existing frameworks and models?This empirical research study looks at the adoption of a relatively simple technology that scans identification documents.  However, the decision to adopt and implement an ID scanner takes place within a complex setting.  Tracking an adoption decision requires understanding of the various actors and their roles.  The research includes 48 semi-structured interviews with police officers, premises owners and managers and other stakeholders involved in the decision to adopt an ID scanner.  Their perceptions of the history leading to an adoption decision, their own role and that of other key actors is examined.  Initial analysis takes place using spray diagrams and further analysis is made through the lenses of existing diffusion and adoption frameworks/models.  Subsequently systems thinking techniques are deployed and the additional insights they provide are highlighted.  This research finds that systems thinking can extend understanding of multi-agency diffusion and adoption decisions when compared with solely utilising existing frameworks/models.  Finally, the research proposes a systems-based framework for collaborative diffusion and adoption analysis	['SDG16', 'SDG09']
598036630	Selective Detection of Toxic C1 Chemicals Using a Hydroxylamine-Based Chemiresistive Sensor Array	Formaldehyde (FA) is a deleterious C1 pollutant commonly found in the interiors of modern buildings. C1 chemicals are generally more toxic than the corresponding C2 chemicals, but the selective discrimination of C1 and C2 chemicals using simple sensory systems is usually challenging. Here, we report the selective detection of FA vapor using a chemiresistive sensor array composed of modified hydroxylamine salts (MHAs, ArCH2ONH2¬∑HCl) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). By screening 32 types of MHAs, we have identified an ideal sensor array that exhibits a characteristic response pattern for FA. Thus, trace FA (0.02‚Äì0.05 ppm in air) can be clearly discriminated from the corresponding C2 chemical, acetaldehyde (AA). This system has been extended to discriminate methanol (C1) from ethanol (C2) in combination with the catalytic conversion of these alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes. Our system offers portable and reliable chemical sensors that discriminate the subtle differences between C1 and C2 chemicals, enabling advanced environmental monitoring and healthcare applications	['SDG11', 'SDG03']
82976940	Exploring children's responses to interpersonal conflict using bubble dialogue in a mainstream and EBD school	This paper discusses an investigation of the use of a computer application, Bubble Dialogue, to construct a narrative which reflects the child's view of the world. In particular it reports on a comparative study of how a group of children with emotional and behavioural difficulties and children who  attend a mainstream school use Bubble Dialogue to express themselves and the strategies used by the  children to resolve interpersonal conflicts. The results show that both groups of children were able to  make good use of the thought/speech distinction which is a special feature of Bubble Dialogue, and  both groups made disclosures, but there were differences in the type of disclosures made. Analysis of conflict resolution strategies revealed that both groups could used a range of strategies but the pattern  of preference differed between the groups. In particular the children with emotional and behavioural difficulties issued more orders and resorted to physical aggression. It is suggested that Bubble Dialogue may therefore be a good tool for practitioners to use to reveal children's perspectives and also for the children themselves to rehearse more appropriate and effective conflict resolution strategie	['SDG04']
599347099	Return Migration and Entrepreneurship: The Role of Highly Skilled Women in Nigeria's Technology Services Sector	This study explores the multifaceted roles and impacts of highly skilled female return migrant entrepreneurs within Nigeria's technology services sector. Leveraging my novel conceptual framework, the Returnee Entrepreneurship Intersectionality Model (REIM) ‚Äì an integrated construct drawn from Human Capital Theory, Opportunity Entrepreneurship Theory, and Intersectionality Theory - the research uncovers how these entrepreneurs navigate the sector and shape the economic and sociocultural landscapes of their home country. I structured this study around four key objectives: to profile these women entrepreneurs, to unpack their motivations for initiating technology-based enterprises, to understand the influence of home conditions on their entrepreneurial activities, and to evaluate the broader implications of their ventures within Nigeria's technology sector (Ramachandran et al., 2019). Qualitative research methods, including digital ethnography, semi-structured interviews, and online data analysis, were employed to gather rich, nuanced data. Findings revealed these return migrants possessed diverse educational backgrounds and professional experiences, accrued both pre-migration and during their time abroad. Many of them leveraged these assets to launch businesses in response to identified market gaps or the desire to give back to their home country, thus displaying both opportunity-driven and a form of necessity-driven entrepreneurship. The study further revealed how their entrepreneurial activities were shaped by the socioeconomic and policy environment at home. Despite the occasional hurdles arising from entrenched gender norms, these women often turned challenges into opportunities, demonstrating resilience and creativity. Their impact on the Nigerian tech sector was multifaceted, introducing innovative products and services, creating jobs, and challenging traditional gender norms. However, measuring their broader impact on the economic performance and sociocultural dynamics of the tech sector proved complex due to factors such as the nascent nature of their presence, the size and scope of their enterprises, and the challenging operating environment. Despite some limitations, including the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic during data collection and constraints in generalizability, the study provides valuable insights into the experiences and impacts of highly skilled female return migrant entrepreneurs in Nigeria's technology services sector. It makes a unique contribution to the discourse on gender, return migrant entrepreneurship, and the tech sector, illuminating a rarely studied intersection of these themes, and in so doing, it generates several thought-provoking avenues for future research	['SDG05', 'SDG08', 'SDG09']
82911285	Understanding how water resources shape our flora	Water is one of the most important resources for plants. It controls and influences their diversity and distribution. Water availability in soil influences plants directly as a limiting resource, or indirectly by filling soil pore spaces and reducing oxygen supply, which limits plant root growth. Water regimes dictate different vegetation types and ecosystems. Global examples are the major world biomes, such as tropical rainforest, deserts or tundra. At this level, precipitation differences as a result of latitude and incoming solar radiation define which species prevail. At a regional level, plant communities are determined by precipitation differences associated with topographic features such as elevation	['SDG06']
131316441	Anti-racist criminology?	In two of the dominant Western democracies, the USA and the UK, 2016 was heavily marked by racial politics. Few people would deny that race was a dominant feature of the 2016 US presidential election. A white challenger to a black incumbent was itself unprecedented, but the background was provided by the black Lives Matter campaign protesting at the fatal neglect of black communities in the US and the lethal violence of their policing. Donald Trump emerged triumphant on the back of what some commentators referred to as a ‚Äòwhitelash‚Äô. This chapter challenges criminology‚Äôs response to these circunstances and traces the way racism operates within the discipline. It argues for a renewal of anti-racism in criminological scholarship, and for new critical tools to be developed that can undo the work of race	['SDG16', 'SDG10']

552802558	Advancing knowledge in public administration: why religion matters	This editorial makes the case that religion is a significant influence on public administration (PA) and religious factors should usefully be considered in researching PA, for purposes of both advancing knowledge and drawing practical implications. The starting point for our argument is the assumption that context does matter for PA, and religion is a neglected part of the context. Religion - broadly defined as a set of coherent answers to the core existential questions that confront any human group and pertain to the relationship of the human to the divine and their codification in creedal forms, and involving a ritual dimension and piety - is interwoven with social, cultural, political and adminstrative elements, which constitutes the context that affects PA in a given jurisdiction. Including religious factors in PA studies would therefore contribute to the advancement of the field	['SDG04']
211273849	Complex Knowing: Promoting Response-Ability Within Music and Science Teacher Education	There are significant pressures within UK Initial Teacher Education (ITE) to maintain and reproduce notions of knowledge as fixed, universal and therefore ‚Äòbankable‚Äô through transfer or transmission. Such views, as embedded in educational structures, separate teachers from learners and learners from contexts. An interesting subset of this trend is the case of music and science education, both of which share in a tradition of materialist practice, where knowledge-making derives from the use of ‚Äòinstruments‚Äô. A representational view of knowledge in these subjects has historically privileged tradition, canon, and reification in music, while emphasising facts and theories as separate from values in science. While these representational views of knowledge have been contested by feminist theory, materialism, and complexity theory, there remain significant challenges in developing music and science student teachers who are response-able to a view of knowing as active, dynamic, emergent and entangled. This chapter explores the use of sensory learning tools and activities with two groups of music and science student teachers. Thinking with Donna Haraway (Staying with the trouble: Making kin in the chthulucene. Duke University Press, New York, 2016), we engage with the ‚Äòtrouble‚Äô that such tools and activities create, both in terms of the students‚Äô learning, the lecturers‚Äô positioning and the socio-political contexts of such trouble within ITE	['SDG04']

82977031	Estimating daytime ecosystem respiration from eddy-flux data	To understand what governs the patterns of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, an understanding of factors influencing the component fluxes, ecosystem respiration and gross primary production is needed. In the present paper, we introduce an alternative method for estimating daytime ecosystem respiration based on whole ecosystem fluxes from a linear regression of photosynthetic photon flux density data vs. daytime net ecosystem exchange data at forest ecosystem level. This method is based on the principles of the Kok-method applied at leaf level for estimating daytime respiration. We demonstrate the method with field data and provide a discussion of the limitations of the method	['SDG15', 'SDG06']
82912440	Communication, relationships and care: A Reader	Communication and relationships have become an increasing focus of attention in debates about the future of health and social care. People working in care services are being encouraged to improve communication processes, to develop more participatory relationships with service users, and to work more closely in partnership with other professionals. This Reader provides a comprehensive collection of literature that aims to enable those involved in care services, as workers, carers or service users, to reflect on their everyday interactions and to situate them in wider contexts. Including new material from the frontline of research and practice, as well as some classic readings, this wide-ranging volume emphasises the need to see interpersonal communication as embedded in relationships, and to take account of issues of power and diversity, as well as the emotional dimension of care work. Covering both health and social care, the Reader is divided into four sections, focusing on:* concepts and contexts* analysing aspects of communication* the person in the process* communication and relationships in organisations	['SDG03', 'SDG10']

82977473	‚ÄòI‚Äôm pregnant ‚Ä¶ what am I going to do?‚Äô An examination of value judgements and moral frameworks in teenage pregnancy decision making	Policy discussion of teenage sexual behaviour has been strongly influenced by a political agenda that characterises teenage pregnancy as a potential ‚Äòrisk‚Äô of sexual activity. This presumed risk framework, however, depends upon an assumption of shared value judgements about the social undesirability of teenage parenthood, and the moral undesirability of teenage abortion. Drawing on three qualitative research projects undertaken in England between 2003 and 2009, this article looks at the complex processes of individual pregnancy decision making, in a context of competing values and moralities. It provides insights into, and understandings of, underlying tensions in the processes through which different degrees of personal autonomy may be experienced, and suggests that when autonomous decision making is compromised, often due to tensions in competing value systems, young women may experience ambivalence or regret about the decision they have made	['SDG03', 'SDG05']
599347086	A Case Study of the experiences of ethnic diversity in leadership in an Outdoor Education Centre	This small-scale exploratory case study in an Outdoor Centre investigates the experiences of people of colour in leadership in outdoor education. Eliciting voices with a qualitative methodology using one-to-one interviews and focus group discussion the study develops two research questions. These discover issues related to people of colour in leadership and how best opportunities to leadership are developed. Using inductive thematic analysis patterns emerged as thematic maps with six important themes; lack of diversity, self-limiting behaviours, access to environment, good role models, access to workplace and awareness. The conclusion creates understandings that shared responsibility is needed for future actions	['SDG10', 'SDG16']
82911378	Towards continuous 4D microgravity monitoring of volcanoes	Four-dimensional or time-lapse microgravity monitoring has been used effectively on volcanoes for decades to characterize the changes in subsurface volcanic systems. With measurements typically lasting from a few days to weeks and then repeated a year later, the spatial resolution of theses studies is often at the expense of temporal resolution and vice versa. Continuous gravity studies with one to two instruments operating for a short period of time (weeks to months) have shown enticing evidence of very rapid changes in the volcanic plumbing system (minutes to hours) and in one case precursory signals leading to eruptive activity were detected. The need for true multi-instrument networks is clear if we are to have both the temporal and spatial reso-lution needed for effective volcano monitoring. However, the high cost of these instruments is currently limiting the implementation of continuous microgravity networks. An interim approach to consider is the development of a collaborative network of researchers able to bring multiple instruments together at key volcanoes to investigate multitemporal physical changes in a few type volcanoes. However, to truly move forward, it is imperative that new low-cost instruments are developed to increase the number of instruments available at a single site. Only in this way can both the temporal and spatial integrity of monitoring be maintained. Integration of these instruments into a multiparameter network of continuously recording sensors is essential for effective volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation	['SDG15']

599347146	Examining the Challenges Faced by International Women with Preschool Children Studying for a Postgraduate Built Environment Degree in the UK	This article examines the academic experiences of five mid-career female international students who were parents of preschool children. These women were studying on a 1-year Built Environment master‚Äôs degree in the United Kingdom. We applied Tinto‚Äôs ‚Äúsense of belonging‚Äù as a theoretical framework to interview women who were studying full time while caring for a preschool-age child or children. Results revealed stresses arising from balancing the academic demands of a 1-year full-time degree with childcare, compounded by a lack of appropriate support from the university. Although universities in general were viewed as offering a welcoming environment, this group of students often felt disappointed with their experience overall. Strategies for addressing identified barriers are proposed that contribute to widening existing university policies to address the specific needs of full-time international student parents	['SDG04', 'SDG05']
82976821	Attitudes to ICTs and approaches to studying in higher education	This article reviews the literature on the relationship between students‚Äô attitudes to ICTs and the approaches to studying that they adopt on their programmes of study in higher education. There is a consistent finding that students who have more positive attitudes to ICTs are more likely to adopt desirable approaches to studying. This is true of younger and older students, and it is true both in face-to-face education and in distance education. The implication is that in both kinds of setting and whatever their age today‚Äôs students regard the use of ICTs as an integral part of their experience of higher education	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
524782089	Online Science Education at Scale: Open and Distance Learning, MOOCS, and Other Learning Assets for Theory and Practice	In this chapter we examine what is meant by online distance learning. We consider briefly the history and refinement of the early correspondence course model, and outline the modern principles of learning design that ensure an enjoyable deep learning experience for students. We also consider the breadth of the distance learning audience and look at some of the barriers to learning that they may experience. The well-intentioned aspirations of truly open education, accessible to all, currently remain unfulfilled, but a good deal of progress has been made in that area. A range of learning offerings exist, from 30 and 60 CAT point long courses   (up to 1/2 of a year of full time study) through to short learning assets that can be studied in a few hours. We note the situations in which MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), SPOCs (Small Private Online Courses), BOCs (Badged Open Courses) and practical assets can supplement or replace traditional face-to-face teaching methods. We use a case study to illustrate the mechanics of producing a successful MOOC. We also describe the issues around teaching practical science online, and offer some examples of how this approach can not only be pedagogically successful but can also deliver a learning experience that students enjoy. In particular we point out the need for attention to detail during production, good quality assurance processes to ensure maximum accessibility, and the value of ongoing engagement with, and support of learners. These features enable the production and delivery of effective, deep and enjoyable learning	['SDG04']
82977058	An overview of learning analytics	Learning analytics, the analysis and representation of data about learners in order to improve learning, is a new lens through which teachers can understand education. It is rooted in the dramatic increase in the quantity of data about learners and linked to management approaches that focus on quantitative metrics, which are sometimes antithetical to an educational sense of teaching. However, learning analytics offers new routes for teachers to understand their students and, hence, to make effective use of their limited resources. This paper explores these issues and describes a series of examples of learning analytics to illustrate the potential. It argues that teachers can and should engage with learning analytics as a way of influencing the metrics agenda towards richer conceptions of learning and to improve their teaching	['SDG04']
82911944	Do demographics have an impact on country of origin effects?	The article discusses the potential impact of consumers' age, socioeconomic group, and sex on the magnitude of country of origin effects for lager and sparkling wine and presents the results of an empirical study into the subject. It is found that older consumers show stronger country of origin effects, which may be due to a generally stronger reliance of older people on broader mental categories, in order to compensate for a decrease in working memory. Socio-economic groups AB are found to show stronger country of origin effects for sparkling wine, whereas socio-economic groups C7C2 show stronger country oforigin effects for lager. This may be related to relative differences in consumption patterns and expertise for the studied products between the two groups. Sex is not found to have any impact on the magnitude of country of origin effects in this study	['SDG12']
82977441	Combined use of SEVIRI and MODIS for detecting, measuring, and monitoring active lava flows at erupting volcanoes	Multispectral data acquired by Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard the geostationary platform Meteosat Second Generation (MSG2), located at 0‚ó¶ longitude, were analyzed to assess the payload suitability for quantitative volcano monitoring. In times of good infrared transparency of the troposphere, SEVIRI data proved particularly suited to detect the onset of effusive eruptions and tomonitor the related lava flows with 15-min refresh rates. After development of a code allowing for fast automated processing of the 96 data streams downlinked daily by MSG2, thorough monitoring tests were carried out on the 2007 eruptions of Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy) and Piton de la Fournaise (Reunion Island, France). The results in radiant flux and effusion rate provided by use of thermal, mid-, and short infrared bands of SEVIRI were validated by exploiting simultaneous MODIS overpasses by Terra and Aqua, up to four times daily	['SDG15', 'SDG13']

The geographical distribution is outlined, together with a selection of important literature, and an explanation of the etymology of the name. This is followed by a short summary of its position in the phylogeny of the family and of the past and present classification in a phylogenetic context. The succulent features present amongst the species of the genus are shortly explained as to morphology and anatomy.This is followed by a synoptical treatment of the succulent species of the genus, complete with typification details, full synonymy, geographical and ecological data, a diagnostic description, and, where applicable, notes on phylogenetic placement and relationships, as well as economic and/or horticultural importance	['SDG15']
82976812	National support for design, the development of propositional models	Many governments around the world acknowledge the role and value of design and have formulated design policies that include national business support programs in design, and that invest in building the capacity of their design sectors. These policies, however, heavily depend on national political and economic contingencies, and thus are subject to change and revision with the advent of each new administration. The alternative-leaning more heavily on nongovernmental organizations and regional design bodies-has its benefits but would also be subject to economic and political turns of fate. This paper reports on an investigation of national design policies in the UK and South Korea and explores some alternative models for developing and implementing these policies. The authors, who hail from Brunel, Loughborough, and Lancaster universities, presented the models to roughly a dozen participants from the design communities in several nations. They found that although no single model was chosen by a majority of respondents, most felt that there had to be some government involvement and endorsement of the policy for it to achieve any success	['SDG17', 'SDG09']
327071043	A qualitative examination of affect and ideology within mass media interventions to increase HIV testing with gay men garnered from a systematic review	Objectives: Increasing appropriate HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) is crucial to HIV prevention.  Mass media interventions are effective in promoting testing, but to date there has been little examination of their active content.Design: We conducted a qualitative analysis of intervention materials (n=69) derived from a systematic review of mass media interventions designed to improve testing with MSM.Methods: Visual data were analysed for their affective and ideological content using a novel method drawing on concepts from semiotics (i.e., broadly speaking, the analysis of signs).Results: Whilst affect was not explicitly theorized or examined in any of the studies, there are clearly identifiable affective elements implicitly at play in these interventions. Four thematic categories of affect/ideology were identified including: (1) sexual desire and the ‚Äòpornographication‚Äô of the gay/bisexual male subject; (2) narratives of romance and love; (3) fear, threat and regret; (4) ‚Äòflattened‚Äô affect.Conclusions: This is the first study to examine and detail the affective and ideological aspects of intervention content in this field. Using analytic techniques such as those reported here, in addition to approaches that focus on the manner in which intervention content address more proximal determinants of behaviour, can provide a rich and potentially more useful evidence-base to assist with future interventions	['SDG03', 'SDG16']

603403064	Attitude and readiness of utilizing virtual reality simulations in interprofessional education to facilitate prompt and safe hospital discharges in England	It can be challenging in England to provide interprofessional education (IPE) in hospitals due to practitioners‚Äô availability, high workload, difficulty to backfill, and training costs. Furthermore, most of the IPE training is facilitated by a didactic teaching strategy in a classroom which fails to engage practitioners to understand each other roles and responsibilities, work procedures, policies, issues related to resources, and their pressure points. Technological innovation, in particular virtual reality has opened up a door to overcome these challenges by enabling practitioners to access IPE virtually, and it provides an immersive experience to them. It is not clear whether health and social care practitioners in England would accept and be ready to embrace this type of technology. Hence, this research study aims to understand attitudes and readiness to access virtual reality simulations (VRS) as a teaching modality and pedagogical tool. Health and social care practitioners (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ22) attended two focus groups after engaging in a VRS and agreed that it could give them valuable learning experiences where they would be able to learn and practice soft skills in a safe environment to discharge people promptly and safely	['SDG03', 'SDG04', 'SDG09']
603403043	Editorial introduction: Racialised migrants navigating the UK's hostile environment policies	This article presents personal stories from a participatory biographical arts-based study with a specific category of racialised migrants: individuals seeking asylum, in the North East of England. Responding to the important questions posed by this special issue, the article explores individual experiences of navigating the UK's hostile environment with a focus on the threefold punitive ‚Äòthreat‚Äô of dispersal, detention, and destitution (Bloch and Schuster, 2005). Adopting an intersectional lens, the discussion highlights the impact of such policies and their compound effect of creating (un)safe and exclusionary everyday spaces, while also outlining the potential for resistance as illustrated by participants‚Äô actions and their creative (re)actions as part of the study's arts-based approach	['SDG10', 'SDG16']
82958411	Developing EAP courses for distance delivery in the global context	New Open University (OU) EAP courses are geared towards enabling students with language needs to achieve in the academic environment. According to research carried out in the OU (O‚ÄôShea-Poon et al, 2009), there is ‚Äòa strong relationship between English language competency and academic attainment‚Äô. In addition ‚Äòcontinued inward migration, international expansion and an increased focus on widening participation are likely to widen the ethnicity attainment gap.‚Äô (p. 2)The objective of these courses is to help students appropriate the written and oral language for their own purposes, whether study related or outside of the study context.The courses offer students access to resources in the form of reading, audio/visual and speaking materials online, with which to interact individually or collectively. Establishing online relationships is seen as key to enabling students to communicate comfortably across geographic boundaries. Communication takes place via Tutor Group Forums, Elluminate (web conferencing programme), email or Skype and is an essential part of the courses. The distance dimension enables the creation of online communities, and the courses prioritise tasks which give students the opportunity to work collectively through group activities, for both formative and summative purposes. This talk will discuss how the courses have been designed to achieve these aims and to what extent they have succeeded, giving examples of materials and activities from three courses, two undergraduate and one postgraduate. It will include links to the course websites and offer innovative and exciting ideas for online English learning in the academic context	['SDG04']
603403058	Allanite U‚ÄìPb dating places new constraints on the high‚Äêpressure to high‚Äêtemperature evolution of the deep Himalayan crust	During continental collision, crustal rocks are buried, deformed, transformed and exhumed. The rates, timescales and tectonic implications of these processes are constrained through the sequence and conditions of metamorphic reactions in major and accessory phases. Petrographic, isotopic and elemental data from metabasite samples in NW Bhutan, eastern Himalaya, suggest initial equilibration under high‚Äêpressure (plagioclase‚Äêabsent and rutile‚Äêpresent) conditions, followed by decompression to lower pressure conditions at high‚Äêtemperatures that stabilized plagioclase, orthopyroxene and ilmenite. Field observations and chemical indicators suggest equilibration under the lower pressure conditions is likely linked to the infiltration of melt from the host metasedimentary rocks. The metabasites preserve two metamorphic growth stages of chemically‚Äêand petrographically distinct allanite that temporally overlap two stages of zircon growth. Allanite cores and zircon mantles grew at c. 19 ¬± 2 and 17‚Äì15.5 Ma respectively, linked texturally and chemically to the high‚Äêpressure evolution. Symplectitic rims on embayed allanite cores, wholly symplectized Aln‚ÄìIlm and Aln‚ÄìCpx grains, and high U zircon rims grew at c. 15.5‚Äì14.5 Ma, linked chemically to the presence of melt and lower pressure, high‚Äêtemperature conditions. A single garnet Lu‚ÄìHf date is interpreted as geologically meaningless, with the bulk rock composition modified by melt infiltration after garnet formation. The open system evolution of these rocks precludes precise determination of the reactive bulk composition during metamorphic evolution and thus absolute conditions, especially during the early high‚Äêpressure evolution. Despite these limitations, we show that combined geochemical and petrographic datasets are still able to provide insights into the rates and timescales of deep orogenic processes. The data suggest a younger and shallower evolution for the NW Bhutan metabasites compared to similar rocks in the central and eastern Himalayas	['SDG15']
603403050	Circulating H3K27me3 modified nucleosomes as a biomarker to monitor anti EZH2-based treatment in advanced solid tumour patients: Translational analyses from CAIRE trial	CAIRE is a phase 2 umbrella study which assessed activity of combined anti-EZH2 tazemetostat and anti-PDL1 durvalumab (T+D) in advanced pretreated pancreatic, colorectal and sarcoma cancer patients. The are currently no plasma biomarkers for anti-EZH2 treatment monitoring or outcome. EZH2 catalyzes tri-methylation of Lysine 27 (K27me3) on nucleosomal histone 3 (H3, H3K27me3). Circulating, cell free H3K27me3 modified nucleosomes are thus a potential biomarker for tazemetostat activity. We evaluated the concentration of circulating H3K27me3 modified nucleosomes normalized to H3.1 nucleosomes (the most common isoform of H3) in T+D treated patients, irrespective of the tumor primary site, to determine target engagement during anti-EZH2 treatment. Plasma from patients receiving T+D was collected before the first cycle administration (C1D1), on the following two cycles administration (C2D1, C3D1) and at end of treatment (EOT). H3.1 and H3K27me3 containing nucleosomes were quantified by Nu.Q¬Æ-H3.1 and Nu.Q¬Æ-H3K27me3 Chemiluminescent Immunoassays. Concentrations are reported as ng/ml and the comparison of their median values at the different timepoints were tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney (independent samples) or Wilcoxon tests (paired samples), with SciPy.stat package (1.6.2). Bonferroni correction was applied to multiple comparisons. Of 197 total samples, 191 were evaluable for both biomarkers (6 higher than top standard after 5x dilution): 69 at C1D1, 63 at C2D1, 50 at C3D1 and 9 at EOT. For 58 patients paired C1D1 and C1D2 levels were available, 46 from C1D1 to C3D1 and 8 from C1D1 to EOT. The normalized Nu.Q¬Æ-H3K27me3 C1D1 median value (0.56) was significantly higher than C2D1 (0.31, p: e-12), C3D1 (0.31, p: e-12) and EOT ones (0.28, p: 0.001). Conversely, Nu.Q¬Æ-H3.1 levels were similar from C1D1 to C3D1 (range of the medians: 122.16-133.25 ng/ml) and increased at EOT (290.09 ng/ml), but with no significant difference between pairwise timepoints. Regarding paired-samples comparison, the normalized Nu.Q¬Æ-H3K27me3 was significantly higher at C1D1 than at C2D1 (p: e-8) and C3D1 (p: e-9) and at EOT (p: 0.02). Conversely, H3.1 concentration was significantly higher at EOT than at C1D1 (p: 0.02), at C2D1 (p: 0.02) and C3D1 (p: 0.05).In conclusion, we described for the first time that normalized circulating nucleosomal H3K27me3 values significantly decrease during T-based treatment in metastatic solid tumor patients, irrespective of the primary disease site, supporting its potential role as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for EZH2 inhibition. Moreover, total nucleosomal H3.1 seems to represent a surrogate of disease burden in metastatic pancreatic, colorectal and sarcoma cancers, as suggested previously in other hematological malignancies	['SDG03']
82983283	Brands at Work: The Search for Meaning in Mundane Work	Brand scholarship traditionally resides within the marketing literature and focuses on organizations‚Äô external relationships with customers. However, increasing critical attention in organization studies has focused on the brand in order to understand its impact on the internal dynamics of employment relations in contemporary organizations. Drawing on an ethnography of frontline service work in an IT consultancy call centre, we explore the brand as an internal organizational resource sustaining the process of employee meaning-making activities. Documenting the ‚Äòwork of the brand‚Äô, we outline what the brand offers both employees and employers and, in doing so, we theorize the brand at work as a connecting mechanism between processes of identity formation/re-formation and regulation. While employees are encouraged to internalize particular brand meanings (in this case prestige, success and quality), we found that they often willingly buy into these intended brand meanings as a palliative to ‚Äòcope‚Äô with mundane work. In this way brand meanings are central to producing a self-disciplining form of employee subjectivity	['SDG08']
603403031	The rise of big philanthropy in global social policy: implications for policy transfer and analysis	A new group of Western development donors has emerged as increasingly influential actors in global social policy. Big philanthropies have begun implementing social protection projects on a vast scale across the Global South and have become integrated within global governance structures. It is essential to examine whether their approach to social policy in the South is effective, legitimate and desirable for the substantive agendas and programmes in these countries and for analysis of social policy in a development context. This study investigates contemporary big philanthropies through a qualitative case-study of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and its role in the health sector in Tanzania. It examines the ways in which big philanthropies engage and seek to influence policy on the ground, directly exploring the views and experiences of local stakeholders. The study finds that big philanthropies have distinctive features and mechanisms as global social policy entrepreneurs. In contrast to the vertical and linear processes associated with traditional policy transfer, a more messy and complex set of mechanisms are observed. The study also indicates that despite considerable resources and authority, philanthropic donors may not be effective in securing policy reform within aid-receiving countries due to a lack of transparency and embeddedness	['SDG01', 'SDG03', 'SDG10']

603403104	Democracy and Stock Market Returns	This paper empirically examines the relationship between the level of democratization and stock index returns in a sample of 74 countries. Compared with democracies, autocratic states are characterized by lower returns despite exhibiting higher return volatility. Even though this higher volatility can be mostly attributed to diversifiable country-specific risk, the Capital Asset Pricing Model is unable to explain the return differential. Instead, it is the level of investor protection that can fully account for the phenomenon described here. Autocratic leaders may be reluctant to promulgate regulation shielding investors and the resultant expropriation depresses the returns realized by outsiders	['SDG16']

It has also been assumed that fear of crime is high, although measures of fear have been declining since the mid-1990s. Of greater concern is a concurrent decline in confidence in the police. This ‚Äògap‚Äô underpins the need for reassurance as a means of gaining legitimacy for policing decisions. We consider the background to reassurance policing and examine interpretation at ground level through interviews with officers involved in a strategy trial based upon a ‚Äòsignal crimes‚Äô perspective	['SDG16']

603403144	Creating an Open Online Educational Resource to Support Learners as They Navigate Their Studies Alongside Work and/or Family	As labour markets undergo rapid and profound transformations, lifelong learning is essential to ensure a responsive, competitive, and skilled workforce. Mature learners are a diverse group, but in comparison to their younger student counterparts, are more likely to have employment and/or caring responsibilities. This field note discusses the development and features of a novel online open educational resource, called At a crossroads: Navigating work and/or family alongside study (At a crossroads for brevity). The resource aimed to assist university students to both learn about the support options available to them as well as to consider how they themselves might make decisions if they experienced a conflict between their student/work/family roles. At a crossroads is innovative in terms of how it was developed (i.e., via survey-based research, story completion method, and consultations sessions with tertiary students) and in terms of what it is (i.e., an online interactive resource that incorporates short dramatizations, social polls, and opportunities to reflect). Our experience in developing this resource caused us to consider how making resources designed to be engaging and informative, while encouraging, positive changes, must be part of the solution. This is especially so when there is significant concern around the overall well-being of tertiary students and their course completion rates. While universities have attempted to offer a range of tools to support their students, on-demand online resources such as At a crossroads are easily accessed, free to use, and deliver content in an engaging manner	['SDG04', 'SDG09']

This research note considers the place of crime as a `real issue', specifically during the national general election held in the UK in May 2005. According to research by Ipsos MORI (May 2005), at the time of the election the issues that mattered most to people were crime (40 per cent), the health service (36 per cent), race relations/immigration (27 per cent) and education (26 per cent). Crime was clearly important to the public, but how was this reflected in the policies of the main parties and the media coverage of the campaign	['SDG16']
82980725	European transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime: agroecological incorporation or contestation?	The ‚Äòfood regime‚Äô concept helps to analyse potential transitions beyond the agro-industrial regime which has been globally dominant since the 1970s.  As its multiple crises generate alternative production methods and products, some have been incorporated into a nascent ‚Äòcorporate-environmental food regime‚Äô.  This nascent regime is illustrated here by two agendas prominent in Europe ‚Äì ‚Äòbioeconomy‚Äô (Life Sciences) and ‚Äòsustainable intensification‚Äô. As a significant difference, the prevalent ‚Äòbioeconomy‚Äô agenda marginalises agroecological practices, while ‚Äòsustainable intensification‚Äô selectively incorporates such practices within a broader toolkit including biotech.  Regardless of that difference, both agendas reinforce a neoliberal productivist narrative: namely, more resource-efficient methods are necessary for increasing production to fulfill the greater market demand for food, feed, fuel, etc. In this way, the capital-accumulation driver is reified as ‚Äòmarket demand‚Äô arising exogenously from the food production system ‚Äì which thereby accommodates societal needs.   By contrast, the agroecology narrative diagnoses the problem as profit-driven agro-industrial monoculture systems making farmers dependent on external inputs, undermining their knowledge, and distancing consumers from agri-producers.  Through such a narrative, new alliances have elaborated a different future linking farmers‚Äô knowledge-exchange, agroecology, food sovereignty, citizens‚Äô initiatives, public knowledge about food production, etc.  Civil society organisations have facilitated such linkages among researchers, scientists and social movements. In those ways, contending narratives justify different trajectories for an agro-food transition.  Each links different innovation paradigms of technique, quality and knowledge.   These differences often remain implicit amidst broad terms such as bioeconomy, sustainable intensification, agroecology, etc.  Making the divergences explicit can help contest transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime, while also counterposing agroecological alternatives	['SDG02', 'SDG12', 'SDG17']
82904225	Enhancing Social Work Management: Theory and Best Practice from the UK and the USA	This book looks at the nature of management in the human services sector and examines the prevailing issues affecting both the UK and USA. Contradictory forces affect the act of management, such as the imperatives driving the introduction of new control systems which exist alongside the requirement to cut resources. In this book, contributors present both the problems and opportunities associated with the growth of management in the social care sector. They cover key topics including the implementation of change in the childcare sector; diversity - looking at the ways in which care managers can more effectively serve a growing multicultural and global society; performance measurement; the impact of electronic technologies and telecommunications; risk and safety in the workplace; and ethics in making personnel decisions, managing finances, planning and maintaining key relationships	['SDG04']
131316695	Rapid induction of dopamine sensitization in the nucleus accumbens shell induced by a single injection of cocaine	Repeated intermittent exposure to cocaine results in the neurochemical sensitization of dopamine (DA) transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Indeed, the excitability of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is enhanced within hours of initial psychostimulant exposure. However, it is not known if this is accompanied by a comparably rapid change in the ability of cocaine to increase extracellular DA concentrations in the ventral striatum. To address this question we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in awake-behaving rats to measure DA responses in the NAc shell following an initial intravenous cocaine injection, and then again 2-h later. Both injections quickly elevated DA levels in the NAc shell, but the second cocaine infusion produced a greater effect than the first, indicating sensitization. This suggests that a single injection of cocaine induces sensitization-related plasticity very rapidly within the mesolimbic DA system	['SDG03']
82971822	Defining the city ‚Äútrumpeter‚Äù: German civic identity and the employment of brass instrumentalists, c.1500	This article examines the employment of brass instrumentalists in German cities around 1500, as a reflection of the political circumstances of the epoch, where rivalry between the distinct components of the social hierarchy encouraged the assertion of power and statusthrough musical patronage. Archival records and contemporary chronicles provide invaluable insights into the performances of civic brass instrumentalists, whether in the provision of signals (by the city watchmen or those who played alongside the cities‚Äô troops) or for theentertainment of the citizens and their guests (within the civic instrumental ensembles the Stadtpfeifer (‚Äòtown pipers‚Äô)). Although the use of ambiguous nomenclature in contemporary records can hinder a definitive understanding of the instruments used by these musicians, the musicians‚Äô different duties within the city walls can often be inferred. Important insights can thereby be gained into the extent of the patronage of these civic brass instrumentalists, their roles within everyday city life, and their resultant contribution to the communication of civic strength to the populace and their guests	['SDG11']
82980765	Integrating Second Life in humanitarian and development training	The paper will address an opportunity for mixed-reality learning in Second Life by discussing the training needs and restrictions for humanitarian and development workers as met by the Open University course TUXR873: Working with conflict:  tools, skills and dialogue.  The paper will map these needs to the affordances of Second Life, in a context of realistic, practical and sustainable course development, and consider the potential for Second Life collaboration to replace the residential aspect of the existing course.  This paper aims to open discussion around the issues involved in developing such a course.  This work is relevant to all sectors of education who might consider embedding virtual world role play into a course.  The work is particularly relevant to providers of distance learning, especially in developing countries	['SDG04']

We now have in excess of 24,000 students using our my.open.ac.uk Google Apps domain via single-sign-on. Of more interest to our learning systems and curriculum teams however was the potential to adopt some of the other tools ‚Äì such as Docs and Sites. This presentation will cover early adoption of Google Apps ‚Äòout-of-the-box‚Äô for curriculum use in some of our popular modules as well as developments to integrate better with our VLE in Moodle	['SDG04']
82958178	The benefits of part-time undergraduate study and UK higher education policy: a literature review	Part-time study in the UK is significant: nearly 40 per cent of higher education students study part-time.This article reports on a literature review that sought to understand the economic and social benefits of part-time study in the UK. It concludes that there are substantial and wide-ranging benefits from studying part-time. The article also aims to place the discussion in the current policy context by drawing attention to the fact that while part-time study is seen as important for increasing the global competitiveness of the UK economy, expansion of higher education has tended to focus on the young, full-time student; furthermore, part-time study is less generously resourced compared to full-time study. New policy pronouncements made in 2009 appear to recognise these policy contradictions, which state that most future growth will be in provision other than the full-time, 3-year undergraduate degree. Indeed, the Government‚Äôs independent review of fees has recognized that parity of funding is an issue and its recommendations on part-time study have been endorsed by the government	['SDG04']
109586	Formative e-Assessment: case stories, design patterns and future scenarios	This chapter presents findings from the JISC funded project ‚ÄòScoping a vision for formative e-assessment‚Äô (FEASST). The project was motivated by the increasing recognition of the importance of formative assessment and the need to identify effective strategies for incorporating it into e-learning. This chapter is particularly interested in the human-centric, social dimensions of e-assessment. The project used the participatory pattern methodology to engage a group of practitioners in developing case studies of formative e-assessment across a range of settings (from Primary to Higher Education) through a series of Practical Enquiry Days. Next, the design patterns were extracted from these cases and the outcomes were analysed against the literature. Patterns were subjected to the scrutiny of a group of software developers who used them as the basis for pedagogical and technical scenarios of use. Finally, the case studies and the design patterns were mapped to a domain map. This chapter provides an overview of the project and highlights an illustrative number of patterns	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82923795	Policing the anti-globalisation protests: patterns and variations in state responses	The arrival of the anti-globalisation movement was manifested in a new wave of protests involving innovative tactics targeting the summit meetings of a variety of international bodies and institutions. In response a new pattern of state management of these protests has developed which goes beyond traditional methods of protest policing. This pattern has involved constraints on civil liberties, including the right to protest and the right to free movement, militarisation of policing, transnational cooperation between police forces, increased surveillance and media and image management. We delineate this new pattern of state management of political dissent by examining policing strategies across five continents, noting national and regional variations in state policing responses	['SDG16']
82981125	Temporal and spatial variability of groundwater‚Äìsurface water fluxes: Development and application of an analytical method using temperature time series	Significant spatial and temporal variability of water fluxes may exist at the river‚Äìgroundwater interface and the assessment of such variability may be important for appreciation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of chemical loading to a river or aquifer. Measurement of such variability is limited due to difficulties of applying conventional Darcian flux based methods. Thermal parameters required to distinguish between conductive and advective heat transfers, and hence to determine water fluxes, exhibit a narrower range within sediments than hydraulic properties required for Darcy-based methods. To exploit this we explore a method of utilising temperature time series to calculate vertical water fluxes across riverbed sediments. River and streambed temperatures may be measured using robust, inexpensive loggers which are simple to deploy. These sensors may provide attenuation and phase shift of the diurnal temperature signal which, at depth, varies with the seepage flux (to or from the river). We present an analytical extension to an existing numerical solution of the heat flow equation, which is used in conjunction with Dynamic Harmonic Regression signal processing techniques for the analysis of diurnal oscillations at two or more depths in the river bed. This permits the computation of a time series of vertical seepage fluxes without the need for complex numerical solutions. Furthermore, Monte Carlo analysis allows an assessment of the uncertainty in the seepage flux estimates to be made. The method has been applied to a reach of a UK lowland river in order to demonstrate that, even in such a low energy environment, water fluxes at the river‚Äìgroundwater interface are significantly variable. Derived fluxes showed significant variation, which is supported by measurements from other methods. We propose that our approach offers a reliable and robust field-based method for quantifying vertical water fluxes at the groundwater‚Äìsurface water interface and a means of recording seepage flux time series	['SDG06']
84152840	The development of new disciplines in Education ‚Äì the Open Education example	The advent of digital, networked technology has had an impact on many aspects of scholarly practice. The influence can be seen as both technical and cultural, as new technologies allow different practices to emerge, and cultural norms from the internet also shape expectations and behavior. In some areas, this has seen the emergence of distinct disciplines, which have built on existing ones and combined these with networked practices. This chapter examines one such example, that of Open Education, and considers whether such areas can be considered as new disciplines. The emergence of such fields is suggested as analogous to the urban renaissance and thedevelopment of towns when certain conditions arose	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82973193	Connecting repositories in the open access domain using text mining and semantic data	This paper presents CORE (COnnecting REpositories), a system that aims to facilitate the access and navigation across scientific papers stored in Open Access repositories. This is being achieved by harvesting metadata and full-text content from Open Access repositories, by applying text mining techniques to discover semanticly related articles and by representing and exposing these relations as Linked Data. The information about associations between articles expressed in an interoperable format will enable the emergence of a wide range of applications. The potential of CORE can be demonstrated on two use-cases: (1) Improving the the navigation capabilities of digital libraries by the means of a CORE pluging, (2) Providing access to digital content from smart phones and tablet devices by the means of the CORE Mobile application	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
84152836	Evaluation of a drop-in clinic for young people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder	Aims To implement and evaluate a nurse-led, multi-agency drop-in clinic for young people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Method A repeated measures observational study over 12 months exploring clinic attendance and user satisfaction, crisis management and did not attend (DNA) rates, consultant time spent with patients, benefits to quality of care, and service flexibility.Results A total of 62 service users participated. A significant improvement in service user experience was observed (P=0.001). Crisis management attendances significantly increased (P=0.005). DNA rates did not reduce significantly (P=0.057). Service users attended for their medication review before or on their due date (P=0.011). Those who needed to were able to spend more time with the staff (P=0.001).Conclusion The clinic improved service accessibility and flexibility. It allowed adherence to clinical guidance, including uptake of psychosocial interventions. There was an overwhelmingly positive improvement in service user experience. Importantly, as contact with the ADHD nurse specialists increased, this significantly reduced the amount of time consultant community paediatricians spent with service users. Further research should examine the cost-effectiveness and longitudinal effect of the drop-in model	['SDG03']
333644996	Nurses' early and ongoing encounters with the dying and the dead: a scoping review of the international literature	Background: End-of-life care is high on policy and political agendas in the UK and internationally. Nurses are at the forefront of this, caring for dying patients, ‚Äòmanaging‚Äô the dead body, and dealing with the corporeal, emotional and relational dimensions of death. Little is known about nurses' prior or early professional experiences of and reactions to death, dying and the corpse and how these might influence practice. Aims: To appraise the international literature on nurses' early experiences of death, dying and the dead body, to better understand how these might influence subsequent practice, and how this might inform our teaching of death, dying and last offices. Methods: A scoping review was undertaken of peer-reviewed publications between, 2000 and 2019, which included nurses working in hospital, care homes and the community. Medline, PubMed, PsychINFO and CINAHL databases were searched and 23 papers meeting the inclusion criteria were read. Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) five-stage approach was adopted to scope the relevant international literature, using where relevant the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Selected papers were independently reviewed and subjected to thematic analysis, leading to the generation of five overarching themes.  Results: The five themes were: different philosophies of care; relationships; knowledge; impact of death; and giving care. The studies came from diverse geographical locations across different settings and were primarily qualitative in design.  Conclusions: Students and registered nurses are impacted both positively and negatively by their early encounters with death and dying. Good communication with patients, families and between professionals, understanding of what constitutes a ‚Äògood‚Äô death, and high-quality mentorship and support were of particular importance	['SDG03', 'SDG04']

426874740	Confessions of lockdown breaches. Problematising morality during the Covid-19 pandemic	This paper examines confessions of Covid-19 breaches in two radio phone-ins. The programmes hosted invited experts who were recruited at certain moments in the show to comment on the (in)direct experiences of lockdown compliance or breaches reported by the callers.The analysis focuses on the social actions the participants are seen to be carrying out and orienting to through talk such confessions and disclosures of minor unlawful behaviour in public.A set of features of confessions were found depending on whether personal circumstances could be said to warrant the breaches and the recipients align or not with the warrantability of the breaches. Callers who disclosed their breaches at the first available opportunity, presented them as primarily warranted by a long-term health condition and displayed full awareness of doing confessing. Both early confessions and those that appear later in the narration were carefully crafted. They were mitigated to minimize the seriousness of the transgression and reduce the actor‚Äôs accountability.The positional nuances of the participants as they share their stories, coupled with their assessment of self- and other behaviour, shines a light on their orientations to, and interactional management of, the moral accountability of behaviour in public spaces during the pandemic	['SDG03', 'SDG16']
82899950	Low attainers in primary mathematics: the whisperers and the maths fairy	In this fascinating book, Jenny Houssart draws on close observations with children in lower mathematics sets in primary schools to investigate why some children opt out of mathematics at an early age. After introducing us to the children, she addresses a particular type of mathematical task in each chapter, including:mental work practical work written work calculators and computers assessment tasks.Through the use of stories and quotes, the author shows how the children respond to specific tasks and presents evidence of a range of difficulties that emerge as the children are working. Each chapter ends with discussions and implications for classroom practice.Low Attainers in Primary Mathematics will be a useful resource for primary teachers, student teachers, SENCOs and teaching assistants who will all recognise these children from their own classrooms and draw insights from this highly readable book	['SDG04']
82924532	The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA32) in autism: Morphometric analyses of deep cortical layers and subcortical white matter	Introduction: The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA32) is a region implicated in both social impairments and repetitive behaviors seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The neuropathological basis for these functional impairments is unclear. Cortical lamination progresses sequentially during mid-gestation, with layer 6 and then layer 5 populated by neurons. An investigation of cellular arrangement within these layers would provide insight into functional cortical circuitry in autism and highlight any significant early developmental disturbances.Methods: A 1 in 4 series of 10m sections from BA32 obtained post-mortem from 8 cases with ASD (24.0 ¬± 5.3 years, range 5-45) and 11 age and gender-matched controls (28.1 ¬± 3.9 years, range 4-44), were stained with toluidine blue, immunolabeled with MAP2 and analysed using unbiased stereology (MicroBrightfield) to determine neuronal and glial cell densities in cortical layers 5, 6, subcortical white matter (WM) and total neuronal numbers (under 1mm2 cortex). Neuronal clustering and alignment were also determined using customised Voronoi tessellation and morphometric image analysis (Media Cybernetics).Results: Mean WM glial cell density was 1.27 fold higher in ASD cases than controls (p=0.05), particularly high in the two oldest ASD cases (1.6-1.7 fold higher). Mean layer 5 and 6 neuronal and glial cell densities did not differ significantly between ASD and controls, although higher mean glial-to-neuronal ratios were found in ASD (L5:1.66; L6:1.88) compared to controls (L5:1.41; L6:1.54). Mean WM neuron densities were higher in ASD but did not reach statistical significance.Discussion: This is the first stereological study of BA32 in ASD. Voronoi and morphometric analyses will be discussed. Increased WM glial density supports our previous findings, did not correlate with seizure activity, but could relate to altered functional connectivity and WM abnormalities reported in ASD. This work was supported by the Autism Tissue Program (US) and funded by Autism Speaks (US)	['SDG03']
84152877	The Impact of Consumer Confusion on Nutrition Literacy and Subsequent Dietary Behavior	This paper examines the impact of consumer confusion on nutrition knowledge, literacy, and dietary behavior. While previous research largely focuses on understanding why consumers might not respond to healthy eating communications, this paper seeks to uncover the various behavioral responses to such campaigns, particularly those that contravene health communication objectives. Using an interpretive methodology, findings suggest that most participants do respond to health communications by striving to eat healthily, but inadequate nutrition information derived from unreliable sources, flawed baseline nutrition knowledge, and poor nutrition literacy hinder participants‚Äô efforts. Inconsistent, incomplete, and contradictory information leaves many participants feeling confused about how to implement healthy eating habits. Further, a lack of ability to differentiate between credible and unreliable sources of nutrition information means that many participants blame their confusion on policymakers, and express frustration and cynicism toward vague and often contradictory communications. This, in turn, increases participants‚Äô reliance on food adverts, product labels, and other commercial sources of ambiguous yet appealing information. The paper's theoretical contribution includes a consumer confusion framework for healthy eating, and policy implications highlight that health campaigns seeking to increase consumer awareness of healthy eating are not enough. Policymakers must become the most credible sources of information about healthy eating, and distinguish themselves from competing and unreliable sources of nutrition information	['SDG02', 'SDG03']
84152901	Consumers' Concerns with How They Are Researched Online	Increased consumer usage of the internet has highlighted a number of problematic online marketing practices, including the use of online platforms to research consumers without full consumer awareness. Despite current debates regarding online research ethics from a marketing perspective, scant research has been published on consumers‚Äô concerns with how they are researched online, which is a knowledge gap this paper seeks to address through qualitative research with UK consumers. This is an important yet neglected topic, given that consumer voices have been under-represented in the online research ethics debate over the years. The paper makes a significant theoretical contribution as it extends the ethics of care and responsibility to an online context, which can frame ongoing online research ethics discussions where problematic power asymmetries may exist between researchers and consumers	['SDG16']
82973660	Defining and theorizing the third sector	According to some, the third sector is unsuited to singular definitions because it is by its nature unruly. However, different definitions or theorizations can be identified. Ontologically oriented definitions of the third sector offer differing views on what it is made up of and what is excluded. Thus, an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù view defines it as a separate sector characterized by organized, private, nonprofit, and voluntary entities. A ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù definition sees it as a hybrid phenomenon combining and connecting other sectors such as state and market (this allows social enterprises and [welfare] state bodies in). In contrast, epistemologically oriented theorizations treat the third sector more as a process or form of practice: a particular type of communication (following systems theory), a form of ordering and governing of people (following discourse theory), or a form of struggle or dialogue between social forces (following critical theory)	['SDG17']
82924509	Micromagnetic testing of model alloys specimens evaluating irradiation effects	The Model Alloy project, carried out by the JRC (Joint Research Centre) within the frame of the European Network AMES (Ageing Material Evaluation System), has the objective to study the influence of elements, i.e. Phosphorus, Cooper and Nickel on the mechanical properties of steels by different content alloys. As these model alloys are a representative of a large spectrum of ferritic steels with parametric variation of elements known to play a significant role in material characteristic and degradation, they provide an opportunity also to study the elements influence on the steels when exposed to degradation by irradiation	['SDG09']
82899869	Media representation of research: the case of a review of ethnic minority education	Concern with the dissemination of research findings has increased in recent years, in the wake of critiques of research for failing to have an impact on policy-making and practice. The most direct way in which research findings can be disseminated to a wide audience is via the mass media. However, coverage of social and educational research in the media is very limited. Furthermore, when it is covered researchers often complain that their work has been distorted. This article examines some of the media coverage of an Office for Standards in Education commissioned review of research on the education of ethnic minority children, published in 1996. Analysis of this media coverage is used as a basis for addressing questions about what is involved in media representation of research, how it should be evaluated, and what meaning can be given to the concept of distortion	['SDG04', 'SDG16']
151211641	Taylor's power law and the statistical modelling of infectious disease surveillance data	Surveillance data collected on several hundred different infectious organisms over 20 years have revealed striking power relationships between their variance and mean in successive time periods. Such patterns are common in ecology, where they are referred to collectively as Taylor's power law. In the paper, these relationships are investigated in detail, with the aim of exploiting them for the descriptive statistical modelling of infectious disease surveillance data. We confirm the existence of variance-to-mean power relationships, with exponent typically between 1 and 2. We investigate skewness-to-mean relationships, which are found broadly to match those expected of Tweedie distributions, and thus confirm the relevance of the Tweedie convergence theorem in this context. We suggest that variance- and skewness-to-mean power laws, when present, should inform statistical modelling of infectious disease surveillance data, notably in descriptive analysis, model building, simulation and interval and threshold estimation, threshold estimation being particularly relevant to outbreak detection	['SDG03', 'SDG09']

286365737	Pathways into Creative Working Lives	The promise of ‚Äòdoing what you love‚Äô continues to attract new entrants into the sector of the cultural and creative industries. The collection asks if the promise is betrayed by the realities of pathways into creative work or, more positively, if a creative identification presents new personal and professional possibilities in the precarious contexts of contemporary work and employment. Two decades into the 21st century, aspiring creative workers can undertake training and higher education courses. They can attempt to convert personal enthusiasms and amateur activities into income-earning careers. Many are self-employed, some utilising skills developed in other occupations. This book presents research on pathways into creative work in a range of occupations and national contexts, including Australia, Belgium, China, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Finland, the Netherlands, Russia, the US, the UK and Vietnam. Chapters explore transitions and issues, and the obstacles that new workers encounter	['SDG08']

593060383	Using genre to explain how children linguistically co-construct make-believe social scenarios in classroom role-play	This paper argues that classroom role-play can be conceptualised theoretically as an oral genre, as defined within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). The work draws on analysis of 15 video-recorded child-led role-plays in which groups of three 4‚Äì5 year-old children engage in five different life-like social scenarios. The study is underpinned by SFL register and genre analysis of the children‚Äôs interactions, and the findings reveal how the children‚Äôs linguistic choices have a direct impact on the dynamically unfolding role-play, and how imaginary scenarios are construed by the instantiation of individual genre stages, some of which serve to regulate the role-play and others that mimic real life social scenarios. The findings suggest that the two different types of stages construe two separate, but interwoven contexts, with the make-believe context often being dependent on the regulative context. The paper offers new insights into the ways in which SFL can reveal nuances in children‚Äôs dialogic and dynamic language in play	['SDG04']
161526422	The litigant in person‚Äôs tale: despair and dysfunction in the civil justice system of England and Wales	There is a dearth of academic literature and evidence about litigants in person (LiPs), despite their growing numbers. This article is an account of the seven months during which I was an LiP in a low-value breach-of-contract case, interspersed with reflections on the emotional impact of that experience. I hope that, by raising awareness of how LiPs are treated, and proposing some further research, the article may contribute to improving the experiences of future LiPs. Despite my extensive legal education, I found the situation enormously draining, and it resulted in one of the longest periods of stress that I have ever experienced. The intransigence of the defendant company and its legal representative paled into insignificance beside the incompetence of HM Courts and Tribunals Service and the incomprehensibility of official forms and processes. Change is urgently needed if LiPs are not to be denied access to civil justice	['SDG16']

131317115	Towards systemic governance of social-biophysical systems: social learning as collaborative performance	It is claimed that ‚Äôresilience thinking‚Äô demands new approaches to collaborative planning and design. Watersheds, or river catchments and coastal estuaries help understand how social and biophysical phenomena mutually influence each other over time. Water governance is an increasingly important issue at the same time as several others that are linked to it, including climate change adaptation, energy and food security and biodiversity conservation. Effective governance needs to link up these diverse areas of policy in order to enhance and maintain the quality of biophysical and social processes in which water plays a central role. New challenges demand new ways of thinking and acting. Building on 15 years of research on social learning we have come to think of water or river catchments as a type of theatre in which new and different types of performance have to be developed to meet present and future needs.This paper will present a synthesis of research spanning 15 years that positions social learning as a duality - a governance mechanism and a dynamic, systemic, praxis process able to contribute to situational transformation and the emergence of collaborative performances in multi-stakeholder, or ‚Äôwicked‚Äô situations such as water catchments. The paper will explore (i) framing considerations; (ii) modalities of systemic praxis; (iii) the mediating role of institutions and (iv) the implications for resilience discourse and praxis as contributors to systemic governance. We will draw out the different ways in which social, biophysical, and interdisciplinary scholars and practitioners frame, water catchments and their governance and unpack the ethical implications of these framing choices in relation to resilience thinking and practice under varying circumstances; the hybridization of several types of knowledge; as well as philosophical and epistemological considerations	['SDG12', 'SDG15', 'SDG06']
323987590	The Social Construction of Quality Diabetes Care Appointments in Primary Care by Adults with Mild-to-Moderate Learning Disabilities, Their Supporters and Healthcare Professionals	Questions have been raised over the quality of healthcare including primary care diabetes services for adults with learning disabilities.  Despite numerous proposals and policies aimed at improving the quality of healthcare services for people with learning disabilities, little is known about what constitutes quality care from the perspective of key stakeholders.  This thesis aimed to: i) explore the social construction of ‚Äòquality care‚Äô in terms of diabetes primary care appointments by adults with mild-to-moderate learning disabilities, those who support their diabetes management and healthcare professionals; ii) reveal any similarities and differences in the ways in which these different stakeholders constructed quality care; and iii) explore the social construction of responsibility for the provision of quality diabetes care appointments for this population.  A discursive psychological analysis was conducted on twenty semi-structured interviews: eight adults with mild-to-moderate learning disabilities and diabetes, seven supporters and five healthcare professionals.The research demonstrated that different stakeholders drew on some common ideas to construct quality diabetes care appointments, notably that appointments should fulfil their purpose, stakeholders should fulfil their respective roles and responsibilities and that successful appointments are informed by medical and/or experiential knowledge.  Stakeholders also drew on differential repertoires around the relationship between independence and quality diabetes care and practicalities and constraints in the provision of quality diabetes care.  Different stakeholders were constructed as having different responsibilities.  People with learning disabilities were often positioned as having a limited level of responsibility whilst others were positioned as accountable.  Quality care was flexibly constructed to perform identity management for the speaker, to attribute responsibility and to justify care which deviated from recommended quality guidance for diabetes care.  Likewise, responsibility for quality care was flexibly taken up and attributed.  The findings of this thesis have implications for ongoing discussions about the nature of quality care for people with learning disabilities in diabetes services and beyond	['SDG03']
131316760	Very large release of mostly volcanic carbon during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum	The Palaeocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a global warming event that occurred about 56 million years ago, and is commonly thought to have been driven primarily by the destabilization of carbon from surface sedimentary reservoirs such as methane hydrates. However, it remains controversial whether such reservoirs were indeed the source of the carbon that drove the warming. Resolving this issue is key to understanding the proximal cause of the warming, and to quantifying the roles of triggers versus feedbacks. Here we present boron isotope data‚Äîa proxy for seawater pH‚Äîthat show that the ocean surface pH was persistently low during the PETM. We combine our pH data with a paired carbon isotope record in an Earth system model in order to reconstruct the unfolding carbon-cycle dynamics during the event. We find strong evidence for a much larger (more than 10,000 petagrams)‚Äîand, on average, isotopically heavier‚Äî carbon source than considered previously. This leads us to identify volcanism associated with the North Atlantic Igneous Province, rather than carbon from a surface reservoir, as the main driver of the PETM. This finding implies that climate- driven amplification of organic carbon feedbacks probably played only a minor part in driving the event. However, we find that enhanced burial of organic matter seems to have been important in eventually sequestering the released carbon and accelerating the recovery of the Earth system	['SDG13', 'SDG07']
82977403	Negotiating multiple positionalities in the interview setting: researching across gender and generational boundaries	This article explores the multiple positionalities that were negotiated during qualitative interviews conducted with older British men who are grandfathers, by a young female early career researcher. Gender, and other methodological challenges negotiated by researchers of men and masculinities have been critiqued, but negotiations of age and generational differences in the field remain scant, despite recognition that age also structures socially constructed and spatially experienced identities. Including reflections on personal research experiences, the article outlines the need for explicit critical attention by geographers to the influence of the fluid intersectional identities of the researcher/researched on research experiences in the field and research outcomes	['SDG10', 'SDG16']

This paper presents the qualitative findings of feedback from a minority ethnic community amongst whom the author tested some case studies to be used as the basis for social marketing communications to be used as part of a health promotion campaign aimed at their community. These materials are based on evidence gathered in a previous stage of this research. The target audiences for this campaign are British Pakistani cardiac patients and members of their social networks. The behaviour being targeted is the provision of social support for these patients and patients‚Äô management of such support	['SDG10', 'SDG03']
82909837	Harmed by work or developing through work?  Issues in the study of psychosocial impacts	About the book: Working to be Someone presents an overview of worldwide research on working children that considers children's own views of employment in favour of adult-constructed arguments about child work.This book brings together contributions by internationally renowned researchers who are committed to a 'subject-orientated' approach as well as views and observations of activists from organizations that either work with child labour or support working children's movements. Chapters examine the traditionally widespread care and domestic work carried out by children, discuss localized explorations of working children - for example in Morocco, India and Europe - as well as consider work as a means for children to contribute economically to the family. Contributors also discuss children's movements and organizations in Africa, Asia and South America that claim work as a necessity for survival as well as a key to children's own agency and citizenship.This book is a key text for both academics and social work practitioners that encourages re-evaluation of the notion of childhood and understands the complex phenomenon of working children	['SDG04', 'SDG08']
82975390	Key principles in assessing students' practice based learning	Assessing student learning in the practice setting is one of the most sophisticated and complex forms of evaluation undertaken by registered nurses. The Nursing and Midwifery Council sets standards relating to learning and assessment in practice, focusing on professional values, communication and interpersonal skills, nursing practice, decision making, leadership, management and teamworking. Assessment needs to include evaluation of skill (technical, psychomotor and interpersonal), attitudes and insights, and reasoning. As assessment of student learning is conducted in the practice setting, risks have to be managed, and targets and service standards met. Therefore, it is understandable that mentors may express doubts about their ability to assess student learning rigorously and fairly. It is particularly challenging for mentors to state confidently what represents a demonstration of learning and competence when asked to decide whether a student is fit to practise	['SDG04']
82981474	Protective effect of the multitarget compound DPH-4 on human SSAO/VAP-1-expressing hCMEC/D3 cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions, an in vitro experimental model of cerebral ischemia.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEStroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related pathologies in which the cerebrovascular system is involved. Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase/vascular adhesion protein-1 (SSAO/VAP-1), increased in both stroke and AD patients' plasma, contributes to the vascular damage. During inflammation its enzymatic activity mediates leukocyte recruitment into the injured tissue, inducing damage in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuronal tissue. We hypothesized that through the alteration of cerebrovascular function, SSAO/VAP-1 might play a role in the stroke-AD transition. Therefore, the protective effect on the BBB of the novel multitarget-directed ligand (MTDL) DPH-4, initially designed for AD therapy, was evaluated.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHA human microvascular brain endothelial cell line expressing the human SSAO/VAP-1 (hCMEC/D3 hSSAO/VAP-1) was generated, as SSAO/VAP-1 expression is lost in cultured cells. To simulate ischemic damage, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation conditions were established in these cells. The protective role of DPH-4 was then evaluated in the presence of methylamine as an SSAO/VAP-1 substrate and/or Œ≤-amyloid (AŒ≤).KEY RESULTSUnder these conditions, DPH-4 was able to protect brain endothelial cells from OGD and reoxygenation-induced damage, as well as to decrease SSAO-dependent leukocyte adhesion. DPH-4 was also effective against the damage induced by OGD and reoxygenation in the presence of AŒ≤ as a model of AD pathology.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONSThese results allow us to conclude that the multitarget compound DPH-4 might provide a therapeutic benefit to delay the onset and/or progression of these two linked neurological pathologies	['SDG03']
82909811	Reorienting the Business School agenda: the case for relevance, rigor, and righteousness	This article contributes to the current debate regarding management education and research. It frames the current business school critique as a paradox regarding the arguments for ‚Äòself-interest‚Äô versus ‚Äòaltruism‚Äô as human motives. Based on this, a typology of management with four representative types labeled: unguided, altruistic, egoistic, and righteous is developed. It is proposed that the path to the future of management education and research might be found by relegitimizing the ‚Äòaltruistic‚Äô spirit of the classics of the great Axial Age (900-200 BCE) and marrying those ideas with the self-interest ideal of mainstream management theories based on economics. By advocating this, a business school agenda that is simultaneously rigorous, relevant, and righteous is promoted	['SDG04', 'SDG08']
82909774	A co-operative scenario based approach to acquisition and validation of system requirements: How exceptions can help!	Scenarios, in most situations, are descriptions of required interactions between a desired system and its environment, which detail normative system behaviour. Our studies of current scenario use in requirements engineering have revealed that there is considerable interest in the use of scenarios for acquisition, elaboration and validation of system requirements. However, scenarios have seldom been used to study inappropriate or exceptional system behaviour. To account for non-normative or undesired system behaviour, it is vital to predict (‚Äòwhat can go wrong‚Äô) and explore the existence or occurrence of ‚Äòexceptions‚Äô in a scenario when the system1 might be prevented from delivering the required service. Identification of exceptions and inclusion of additional requirements to prevent their occurrence or mitigate their effects yield robust and fault-tolerant design solutions.In this article, we present a prototype software tool called CREWS‚ÄìSAVRE for systematic scenario generation and use. We describe the innovative features of the tool and demonstrate them with an example of tool‚Äôs use. Further, we have identified three kinds of exceptions: generic, permutation and problem exceptions, and have derived complex taxonomies of problem exceptions. We have populated SAVRE with the taxonomies of generic, permutation and problem exceptions. The exceptions can be chosen by the requirements engineer to include them in the generated scenarios to explore the correctness and completeness of requirements. In addition, the taxonomies of problem exceptions can also serve as checklists and help a requirements engineer to predict non-normative system behaviour in a scenario	['SDG09']
188345894	Accidents Have No Cure! Road Death as Industrial Catastrophe in Eastern Africa	This article offers an anthropological critique of the recent epidemiological turn in global road safety through ethnographic attention to the ways in which people in East Africa actually discuss fatal road traffic accidents. Through limiting case studies of professional drivers in Kenya and Tanzania, this article examines the conceptual ethics of continuing to draw upon the ‚Äòaccidental‚Äô in explanations of road death and injury. Might the epidemiological turn eventually encourage new forms of tolerance to road deaths and injuries? In focusing on this question, it is argued that an approach more attentive to road fatalities as a diffuse, but routine industrial catastrophe more acutely exposes the politics of automobility and its uncertainties	['SDG03']
82909807	Activity-based scenarios for and approaches to ubiquitous e-Learning	This paper presents scenarios for ubiquitous e-Learning in heterogeneous networks. It concludes by arguing for the development of a learning-focused analogue, activity-based e-Learning extensions (ABLE), of activity-based computing (ABC). The goal would be to offer the learning-support/performance-support equivalent of ABC‚Äôs support for human activities in a ubiquitous computing environment, relevant to areas that are hard to model today: informal on-the-job learning; peer-to-peer support and informal sharing of content in ad hoc work groups; formal and informal ways to capture and share knowledge-focused insights and processes; content and systems to aid reflection. Just as ABC supplements traditional computing approaches (in ABC, data- and application-oriented) to suit ‚Äòmultiple, parallel and mobile work activities‚Äô (Bardram et al. in Support for ABC in a personal computing operating system. CHI 2006 proceedings. Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada, 22‚Äì27 April 2006, pp 211‚Äì220), so ABLE could supplement traditional e-learning approaches (often largely content-focused, sometimes little more than page-turning) to suit those same work activities, and make e-Learning potentially more resilient to interruptions, more fun and more memorable	['SDG04']
82981872	The future of digital methods for complex datasets	Seeking to challenge the focus on 'big data' by understanding it outside of the computational power required to process it, this volume explores the role of digital methods in the future of digital humanities research. The essays are united by the theme of complexity---but manifest that complexity across an unusual spectrum. The methods included rise out of fields of study including library and information science, informatics, literary studies, English, and computer science. Sources explored include traditional national archives, international web archives, medieval musical scores, digitised books, early modern network ontologies and educational data/learning analytics. These essays discuss the practical implications of web scraping, the implications of creating new scholarly objects, the importance of documentation and the intricacies of applying topic modelling and linked open data methods. Together, the volume suggests that the humanities comfort with multiplicities, contingency, and uncertainty in sources may lend itself to resisting the reductionism that makes technical projects easier to manage, flattening messy, human data into neat binaries. These essays remind us that their results must be contextualised through scholars' knowledge of the sources and the methods by which they came to be constructed not just as as 'big data' datasets	['SDG09']
82921926	Safety assessment post-licensure	About the book:This publication covers all aspects of new vaccine development from the preclinical stage to licensing. It contains discussions about the preclinical testing which is necessary to obtain permission to test a new vaccine in clinical trials and to organize a clinical plan that will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine. In addition, some aspects of newer strategies, such as DNA immunization, are presented as well as a number of theoretical issues relating to vaccination, such as immunological correlates of protection, interference with immune responses, combination of vaccines, and the natural history of disease. Much attention is devoted to the proof of efficacy, a process which is both expensive and complicated. This volume is important reading for all scientists interested in vaccine development, especially those working in industry, government and public health authorities	['SDG03']
82975313	Fuel mix diversification incentives in liberalized electricity markets: a Mean‚ÄìVariance Portfolio theory approach	Monte Carlo simulations of gas, coal and nuclear plant investment returns are used as inputs of a Mean‚Äì Variance Portfolio optimization to identify optimal base load generation portfolios for large electricity generators in liberalized electricity markets. We study the impact of fuel, electricity, and CO2 price risks and their degree of correlation on optimal plant portfolios. High degrees of correlation between gas and electricity prices ‚Äì as observed in most European markets ‚Äì reduce gas plant risks and make portfolios dominated by gas plant more attractive. Long-term power purchase contracts and/or a lower cost of capital can rebalance optimal portfolios towards more diversified portfolios with larger shares of nuclear and coal plants	['SDG07']
82977688	Forests of the tropical eastern Andean flank during the middle pleistocene	Inter-bedded volcanic and organic sediments from Erazo (Ecuador) indicate the presence of four different forest assemblages on the eastern Andean flank during the middle Pleistocene. Radiometric dates (40Ar‚Äì39Ar) obtained fromthe volcanic ash indicate that deposition occurred between 620,000 and 192,000 years ago. Examination of the organic sediment composition and the fossil pollen, wood and charcoal it contains provides insight into depositional environment, vegetation assemblage and fire history. The high organic content and abundance of macro fossils found throughout the sediment suggest that during the period of deposition the local environment was either a swamp or a shallow water body. The correlation of fire activity (peaks in charcoal abundance) with volcanic ash deposits through most of the record suggests that volcanoes were the main source of ignition. The low abundance of grass (typically Alnus-Arecaceae, ii) Miconia-Melastomataceae/Combretaceae-Moraceae/Urticaceae, iii) Arecaceae-Alnus, and iv) Podocarpus with Oreopanax sp. and Melastomataceae/Combretaceae. Changes in the forest floristic composition indicate high vegetation turnover and reassortment of taxa between upper and lower montane forests during the middle Pleistocene as well as the persistence of forest cover	['SDG13', 'SDG15']
82977694	GCP18: New forms of assessment for social TEL environments	Our current model for the assessment of learning is primarily summative and individual, firmly bound to hierarchical education structures. This model was developed when knowledge was not abundantly available, when groups of learners were taught and examined at the same time in the same physical location, when teaches and learners were clearly differentiated and when online collaboration and publication were unknown. As new models of learning have been widely adopted, this model of assessment is no longer fit for purpose. A new model is required which takes into account the changes in learning and teaching that have taken place during the last decade	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82979403	Supporting informal design with interactive whiteboards	Whiteboards serve an important role in supporting informal design, providing a fluid and flexible medium for collaborative design. Interactive whiteboards offer the potential for enhanced support for manipulating content, managing sketches, and distributed work, but little is known about how this support affects the practice of informal design. To understand the opportunities and challenges, we first conducted a literature review, identifying 14 behaviors that occur during informal design. We then designed an interactive whiteboard system to support all of these behaviors and deployed the system to three groups of designers. Through usage logs and interviews, we examined the effects of interactivity on whiteboard use across a wide spectrum of design behaviors, identifying ways in which interactive whiteboards support the practices used in physical whiteboards and where they enable designers to work more effectively	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82909748	An efficient numerical terrestrial scheme (ENTS) for Earth system modelling	We present a minimal spatial model of vegetation carbon, soil carbon and soil water storage and the exchange of energy, water and carbon with the atmosphere. The efficient numerical terrestrial scheme (ENTS) is designed for long time period simulations and large ensemble studies in Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs). ENTS includes new parameterisations of vegetation fractional cover and roughness length as functions of vegetation carbon, and a relationship between soil carbon storage and soil water holding capacity. We make and justify the approximation that when the solar forcing is a diurnal average, as in our EMIC, the land radiation balance equilibrates with the atmosphere within a few days. This allows us to solve directly for equilibrium land temperature, making ENTS very computationally efficient and avoiding problems of numerical instability that beset many land surface schemes. We tune the carbon cycle parameters towards observed values of global carbon storage in vegetation and soil and estimated global fluxes of net photosynthesis, vegetation respiration, leaf litt	['SDG09', 'SDG06']
82981243	'You can't move in Hackney without bumping into an anthropologist': why certain places attract research attention	In social research some places and populations are disproportionately targeted by researchers. While relatively little work exists on the concept of over-research those accounts that do exist tend to focus on participant-based research relationships and not place-based research relationships. Using interdisciplinary approaches and fieldwork experiences from a recently completed qualitative study of urban multiculture in England we develop the over-research debates in three key ways. First, the notion of ‚Äòover-research‚Äô carries negative connotations and we reflect on these as well as the possibility of more nuanced readings of research encounters. Second, we develop a more relational analysis, in which place ‚Äì the London Borough of Hackney ‚Äì is understood to be an animating force in the research process. Third, we argue that our experiences of the research provide evidence that many of the participants in the project were adept and confident in their engagements with the research process. In this way, the article suggests, disproportionate research attention may foster not research fatigue but a more knowing and co-productive research relationship.	['SDG11']

Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) systems have been described and evaluated in a number of ways by different researchers in the field. This paper proposes that computer conferencing systems should be designed to encourage students to participate in three dimensions previously treated by separate researchers. These can be summarised as a knowledge dimension, a social dimension and a motivational dimension. This paper reports on how one particular conference, that of M205-STILE, was constructed to take account of these dimensions and to facilitate students' computer-supported co-operative learning	['SDG04']
82922393	Ethical and Philosophical Aspects of Nursing Children and Young People	Nurses and healthcare professionals are constantly faced with ethical and philosophical dilemmas when working with children in everyday practice. Ethical and Philosophical Aspects of Nursing Children and young people is a comprehensive text on the ethics and philosophy behind paediatric nursing, that reflects some of the contemporary issues encountered while working with children and young people. This important new book provides a philosophical and historical analysis of the subject, looking at a review of sociological and political theories concerning the nature of childhood, and providing a critical analysis of contemporary notions about childhood. It then goes on to look at moral theories and their application to paediatric nursing practice, ethical issues when caring for children of all ages, from infancy to adolescence. It looks at issues of disabled children, confidentiality, mental health issues, children‚Äôs rights, and pain management. With case studies and activities throughout, this book will enable students and newly qualified nurses both to understand philosophical concepts and issues but also to articulate their own reflections and observations on these subjects	['SDG03', 'SDG04']
286186703	Gamification: What it is, and how to fight it	‚ÄòGamification‚Äô is understood as the application of game systems ‚Äì competition, rewards, quantifying player/user behaviour ‚Äì into non-game domains, such as work, productivity and fitness. Such practices are deeply problematic as they represent the capture of ‚Äòplay‚Äô in the pursuit of neoliberal rationalization and the managerial optimization of working life and labour. However, applying games and play to social life is also central to the Situationist International, as a form of resistance against the regularity and standardization of everyday behaviour. In this article, the authors distinguish between two types of gamification: first, ‚Äògamification-from-above‚Äô, involving the optimization and rationalizing of work practices by management; and second, ‚Äògamification-from-below‚Äô, a form of active resistance against control at work. Drawing on Autonomism and Situationism, the authors argue that it is possible to transform non-games into games as resistance, rather than transferring game elements out of playful contexts and into managerial ones. Since the original ‚Äògamification‚Äô term is now lost, the authors develop the alternative conception as a practice that supports workers, rather than one used to adapt behaviour to capital. The article concludes with a renewed call for this ‚Äògamification-from-below‚Äô, which is an ideal form of resistance against gamification-from-above and its capture of play in pursuit of work	['SDG04', 'SDG08']

It reflects on the role of social engineering as the entry point of many sophisticated attacks and highlights the relevance of the human element as the starting point of implementing cyber security programmes in organisations as well as securing individual online behaviour. Issues associated with the emerging trends in human behaviour research and ethics are presented for further discussion.

82902944	Elastic strains around cracked cold-expanded fastener holes measured using the synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique	In this work, the capability of the synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique to measure changes in the residual strains caused by fatigue crack growth from cold-expanded holes in an aluminium alloy plate has been investigated. The measurement technique was validated by comparing the synchrotron measurements around uncracked holes with those obtained on similar specimens using the neutron diffraction and Sachs' techniques. Measurements were performed with and without superimposed tensile mechanical loading and the results compared with analytical results. The improved spatial resolution of the synchrotron technique relative to the other methods has allowed the strain fields around a fatigue crack growing from a cold-expanded hole to be evaluated in the unloaded state and at two loading levels. Only at the higher load does the crack appear to open along its full length	['SDG09']
82908230	Applying future studies methods to understanding the impact of University information and communication technology strategies on learning	This paper aims to explore the potential of certain Future Studies techniques to provide insight into the question of the impact of higher education Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strategies on student learning. The approach is to consider three case studies of new universities in different countries, and to identify the main features of their ICT strategies, related variables, key change drivers, and trends. Models representing ICT strategy and dimensions of student learning are then drawn together to product a number of possible scenarios and testable hypotheses. Recommendations for refining the analysis are highlighted	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82984107	'ICT-Periodism' in the Classroom: Lessons Learnt from English in Action	This paper illustrates the factors affecting the use of ICT in the classroom in a large scale language development project in Bangladesh. The project, called English in Action (EIA) provides ICT materials along with print based materials for the teachers as well as face-to-face training to bring changes in primary and secondary classroom practices. On-going monitoring data showed that the use of audio materials increases as the intervention progresses through the year, however, the pattern changes when a decrease is observed during the third quarter. The study focused on the factors that have an influence on the use of audio in EIA classrooms during different quarters of the year and explored the underlying causes. The study adopted a mixed method approach and used classroom observations and semi-structured interviews with fifteen primary teachers to gather data. Findings showed that different nature and the pressure of the contents during different quarters of the year and the examination focused education system are the key factors that affect the use of ICT in English classes at the primary level. This raises the concern regarding ‚Äònegative back-wash effect‚Äô (Pan, 2009) of the exam system, which can stop effective pedagogical changes in the classroom from happening	['SDG04']
82907255	The role of water and oxygen impurities on ozone production in a negative corona discharge of CO2	The production of ozone in a negative corona discharge fed by carbon dioxide with embedded traces of oxygen and water has been studied. The presence of traces of oxygen in both pure and dry CO2 leads to an increase in nascent ozone concentrations. In contrast, traces of water vapour (0-800 ppm) are shown to rapidly suppress ozone concentrations with the largest decreases being observed at lowest gas pressures in the discharge (300 Torr). The presence of water vapour did not considerably affect the electrical properties of negative dc corona suggesting that a chemical process is responsible for the ozone loss. We have shown that the addition of water up to a concentration of 1500 ppm has only a marginal effect on the processes of ozone formation but the catalytic cycle of ozone destruction involving OH radicals can be the reason for observed decrease in the total ozone concentration with increasing water concentration	['SDG13', 'SDG12']
82905210	What are subcutaneous adipocytes really good for‚Ä¶?	Our acute awareness of the cosmetic, psychosocial and sexual importance of subcutaneous adipose tissue contrasts dramatically with how poorly we have understood the biology of this massive, enigmatic, often ignored and much-abused skin compartment. Therefore, it is timely to recall the exciting, steadily growing, yet underappreciated body of evidence that subcutaneous adipocytes are so much more than just ‚Äòfat guys‚Äô, hanging around passively to conspire, at most, against your desperate attempts to maintain ideal weight. Although the subcutis, quantitatively, tends to represent the dominant architectural component of human skin, conventional wisdom confines its biological key functions to those of energy storage, physical buffer, thermoregulation and thermoinsulation. However, already the distribution of human superficial adipose tissue, by itself, questions how justified the popular belief is that ‚Äòskin fat‚Äô (which actually may be more diverse than often assumed) serves primarily thermoinsulatory purposes. And although the metabolic complications of obesity are well appreciated, our understanding of how exactly subcutaneous adipocytes contribute to extracutaneous disease ‚Äì and even influence important immune and brain functions! ‚Äì is far from complete. The increasing insights recently won into subcutaneous adipose tissue as a cytokine depot that regulates innate immunity and cell growth exemplarily serve to illustrate the vast open research expanses that remain to be fully explored in the subcutis. The following public debate carries you from the evolutionary origins and the key functional purposes of adipose tissue, via adipose-derived stem cells and adipokines straight to the neuroendocrine, immunomodulatory and central nervous effects of signals that originate in the subcutis ‚Äì perhaps, the most underestimated tissue of the human body. The editors are confident that, at the end, you shall agree: No basic scientist and no doctor with a serious interest in skin, and hardly anyone else in the life sciences, can afford to ignore the subcutaneous adipocyte ‚Äì beyond its ample impact on beauty, benessence and body mass	['SDG03']
337616644	Analysis of the potential contribution of value-adding services (VAS) to the competitive logistics strategy of ports	This article examines the potential contribution of value-adding services (VAS) to port logistics strategy development in order to enhance competitiveness in the face of increasing competition between ports. On the basis of an empirical study taking the critical-realist approach of mixed methods' research and using data from multiple case-study ports in both developed and developing countries, the relevance and deployment of VAS are assessed with a view to facilitating port strategy decisions. This study addresses the paucity of VAS investigations in the maritime logistics literature and examines the potential contribution of VAS to port competitiveness from the perspective of port users. Results demonstrate that the most readily available and accessible VAS are transport services, followed by warehousing and water supplies. The article concludes that VAS have the potential to both attract port users and retain them	['SDG09']
82921486	What makes a good ontology? A case-study in fine-grained knowledge reuse	"Understanding which ontology characteristics can predict a ""good"" quality ontology, is a core and ongoing task in the Semantic Web. In this paper, we provide our findings on which structural ontology characteristics are usually observed in high-quality ontologies. We obtain these findings through a task-based evaluation, where the task is the assessment of the correctness of semantic relations. This task is of increasing importance for a set of novel Semantic Web tools, which perform fine-grained knowledge reuse (i.e., they reuse only appropriate parts of a given ontology instead of the entire ontology). We conclude that, while structural ontology characteristics do not provide statistically significant information to ensure that an ontology is reliable (""good""), in general, richly populated ontologies, with higher depth and breadth variance are more likely to provide reliable semantic content"	['SDG09']

82922122	Natural Order: why social psychologists should study (a constructed version of) natural language and why they have not done so	This article argues that the notion of natural language should be treated with caution, for natural language is not an empirical object so much as the product of a particular analytic stance that is sensitive to the action orientation and sequential embeddedness of discourse. The virtue of studying materials that are generated without the influence of researchers (e.g., records of talk in home and work situations) is pressed. However, it is suggested that social psychologists are impeded in pursuing such a course by their adherence to hypothetico deductivist methods, tocognitivist metatheory, and toetic rather than emic styles of analysis	['SDG10', 'SDG04']
82921867	Best practice benchmarking: a route to competiveness	This paper examines the use of best practice benchmarking as an approach to performance improvement in the airline industry. The case study draws upon phenomenological evidence from the aircraft maintenance section of Britannia Airways. A range of benchmarking issues, which could be applied to different divisions of an airline are highlighted. In particular, inter disciplinary team building, employee involvement, relationships with other industry players and identification of ‚Äòbest in class'. Airline alliances and the global trend towards economically deregulated air transport are identified as factors likely to increase the adoption of benchmarking as a route to competitiveness	['SDG08']
46524261	Ontology Forecasting in Scientific Literature: Semantic Concepts Prediction based on Innovation-Adoption Priors	The ontology engineering research community has focused for many years on supporting the creation, development and evolution of ontologies. Ontology forecasting, which aims at predicting semantic changes in an ontology, represents instead a new challenge. In this paper, we want to give a contribution to this novel endeavour by focusing on the task of forecasting semantic concepts in the research domain. Indeed, ontologies representing scientific disciplines contain only research topics that are already popular enough to be selected by human experts or automatic algorithms. They are thus unfit to support tasks which require the ability of describing and exploring the forefront of research, such as trend detection and horizon scanning. We address this issue by introducing the Semantic Innovation Forecast (SIF) model, which predicts new concepts of an ontology at time t + 1, using only data available at time t. Our approach relies on lexical innovation and adoption information extracted from historical data. We evaluated the SIF model on a very large dataset consisting of over one million scientific papers belonging to the Computer Science domain: the outcomes show that the proposed approach offers a competitive boost in mean average precision-at-ten compared to the baselines when forecasting over 5 years	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82921824	Multimodality through physical digital design	This paper aims to deliver a better understanding of the relationship between physical and virtual, two dimensional and three dimensional representations of form employed in the critical early stages of design. It will present initial findings from observation of practice into how designers move between these representations, and of the kind and quantity of information they choose to exchange between them. Informed by these findings, and in response to the emerging need for new methods of sketching and prototyping in the digital era, it will also present a new proposal for hybrid virtual/physical digital design practice based on a significant modification of previous approaches	['SDG09']
82907440	Citizenship between Past and Future	Citizenship Between Past and Future brings together some of the most prominent scholars in the field of citizenship studies to assess, critically and contextually, the ongoing significance of citizenship as an object of study. The authors reflect on the major issues and debates that have emerged in the field of citizenship studies over the last decade as well as to point out some of the new challenges ahead. The book recasts traditional thinking about citizenship beyond issues of legal status and investigates it rather as a strategic concept that is central in the analysis of identity, participation, human rights, and emerging forms of political life.Seeking to broaden the debate on the meaning, significance, and practices of citizenship, the authors engage with an impressive and challenging array of theoretical and substantive issues. Citizenship is investigated in terms of debates over inclusion and exclusion, statism and cosmopolitanism, status and rights, gender and race, and multiculturalism and global inequality. The book revitalizes the debate over a key political concept and offers new ways of thinking about citizenship that take into account contemporary challenges	['SDG16']
82921802	Using open educational resources and Web 2.0 tools to support ethical reasoning in information and computer sciences project-based learning	This project investigated the use of Web 2.0 tools and Open Educational Resources (OER) to support students engaged in project-based learning in ICS. Capitalising on existing environments, tools and learning resources, the project explored the potential of these openly and freely accessible resources to facilitate a space where students can be encouraged to identify, engage with and discuss ethical issues that arise in their project work.  The project consisted of a small-scale investigation into students‚Äô views of social networking as a class of tools potentially useful in a project-based course taught entirely at a distance, with a particular focus on the area of ethical reasoning. Ethics is an important part of the course and integral to its assessment, and the work carried out enabled an initial evaluation of the OER in the area of ethics in ICS (Ferreira & Monk, 2009) created with previous support from the HEA Network for ICS	['SDG04']

82922023	Discourses of democracy in neighborhood governance	This article is concerned with neighborhood governance reflecting a policy agenda which identifies the 'neighborhood' as a significant space for democratic renewal. But how is democracy understood and practiced? Many neighborhood policy programs are sponsored by central or local government and public managers have an important role in translating policy into local practice. Using a critical discourse analytic framework we examine actual  examples of public managers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ descriptions of their governance arrangements to elaborate their understandings and interpretations of democracy. Examples are taken from interviews in neighborhood renewal schemes in Birmingham and Copenhagen. Analysis suggests that in the cases examined here the democratic devices associated with different ideal-types of neighborhood governance presented both actual and potential dilemmas for public managers or became lost amongst other more immediate concerns for each project. This suggests that the democratic element of neighborhood governance may need even more clear conceptual work and more forceful advocacy	['SDG11', 'SDG16']
82981194	Experiences of accessing CCTV data: the urban topologies of subject access requests	In this paper, I argue that careful attention needs to be paid to the handling of urban CCTV digital data. Since the early 1990s, CCTV has left an indelible mark on UK cities, and beyond. CCTV is a crime-reduction strategy, and its activation owes much to the laws and regulations that govern its function and the passivity with which it is often viewed. I consider the nature of security when CCTV signs, recorded images and the rights of citizens are interlinked in controlled urban spaces. Despite the regulatory powers of the Data Protection Act, the management of CCTV data is at times poorly operationalised and often obfuscated. The paper discusses my experiences of identifying 17 different CCTV cameras and being recorded and my attempts to access my images through subject access requests (SARs). In what follows, I draw on different topologies of experience in expanding upon the mutable, unpredictable and intensive relations that guide the management of CCTV data	['SDG11']

224959269	Student data privacy in MOOCs: a sentiment analysis	Student data privacy as a research focus and practice is relatively under-researched in the context of massive open online courses (MOOCs). Central to researching student data privacy in the context of online service providers are the various user agreements that participants must accept or opt into before they can use a MOOC platform. Such documents form the basis for any recourse individuals might have if they have concerns about data privacy. Of specific interest in this research is the emotive use of language used in these documents. Research in other genres suggest that emotive language can be intentionally used to facilitate buy-in or to soften the implications of the agreement between user and provider. This article shares our findings of a sentiment analysis of the terms and conditions and privacy statements of three major MOOC providers	['SDG04']

82973799	Mylonites of the South Armorican Shear Zone: insights for crustal-scale fluid flow and water‚Äìrock interaction processes	Mylonites display petrographical and geochemical characteristics that can be related to syn-deformation fluid circulation. The South Armorican Shear Zone, a major structural feature of the Armorican Massif (France), is outlined by the presence of mylonitic rocks cropping out mostly in open quarries. These mylonites were essentially formed at the expense of peraluminous granitic bodies. Deformation occurred from ductile conditions in the biotite stability field (>400 ¬∞C) down to lower greenschist cataclasis and brecciation, where carbonation developed. U‚ÄìPb analyses on zircon and monazite define a minimum duration of 15 Ma for the deformation and hydrothermal history, between 315 Ma and 300 Ma. Fluid circulations are well documented, by way of petrographic observation (chlorite and carbonate crystallization), mineralogical composition analysis (muscovite chemistry), erratic mobility behavior of some elements (As, Sn, U for instance), and stable isotope composition analysis of the infiltrated rocks. High temperature deformation is not accompanied by alteration of the O isotope system, which implies either low fluid/rock ratio and/or the involvement of Œ¥18O crustal fluids with a composition similar to that of the rocks. On the other hand, some low temperature mylonites show a drastic decrease in the Œ¥18O values, which has to be related to the influx of surface derived waters. The heat source necessary for this crustal scale downward infiltration of fluids followed by upward motion was likely provided by the exhumation of lower crustal units in the South Armorican domain	['SDG06']
82908266	Practical applications of the principles and practices of palliative care to the residential sector	About the book: In our society, the overwhelming majority of people die in later life. They typically die slowly of chronic illness, with multiple co-existing problems over long periods of time. They spend the majority of their final years at home, but many will die in hospitals or care homes. This book explores the possibilities for improving the care of older people dying in residential care and nursing homes. It argues that there are aspects of palliative care that, given the right circumstances, are transferable to dying people in settings that are not domestic or hospice based. End of Life in Care Homes describes what happens in nursing and resiential care homes when a resident is dying, how carers cope, and the practical, health and emotional challenges that carers face on top of thier day-to-day work. Based on detailed research from both the UK and US, the book shows how the situation can be improved. care home staff of all levels as well as palliative care practitioners, general practitioners, Macmillan nurses and other health care professionals who come into contact with dying residents will find this book of great value. Geriatricians, policy makers and administrators of residential care and nursing homes should also find it a useful resource	['SDG03']
153444283	On the Transnational Dialectics of Solidarity and Care	The urgency to global political life that Shirin Rai points to in the lead article of this Forum is one that is, in major part, borne of a global crisis of social reproduction. This crisis is less immediately visible than the rise of terrorism, right-wing nationalism, or military conflict, but no less harmful, violent or deadly in its effects. Where the basic means for reproducing and sustaining labor power are so severely compromised as to undercut human life, or to curtail care for human welfare that would otherwise reproduce people as physical, social, and cultural beings, then this constitutes a political urgency like no other	['SDG10', 'SDG08']
481416521	Spelling development in young children: A case of representational redescription?	Two experiments explored children's spelling development in the context of the representational-redescription (RR) model (A. Karmiloff-Smith, 1992). Fifty-one 5- to 7-year-old children (Experiment 1) and 44 5- to 6-year-old children (Experiment 2) were assessed, using spelling production and recognition tasks, for phonological to morphological spelling development and representational levels derived from the RR model, respectively. Children were allocated to 1 of the stages for spelling production from T. Nunes, M. Bindman, and P. Bryant (1997) and to 1 of the representational levels derived from the RR model for spelling recognition and accompanying verbal justifications indicating their knowledge and understanding of spelling. These results are discussed in terms of how the RR model accounts for the hitherto unexplained cognitive mechanisms that underlie spelling development and the notion of multirepresentation in spelling	['SDG04']
188345769	How HE educators learn to teach Massive Open Online Courses. A case study	People working within HE institutions need to learn new forms of teaching and learning practice, to transform the ways they work. This study explores the types of knowledge gained by those working in HE when they teach massive open online courses (MOOCs). Data were gathered through a case study involving interviews with six people with teaching roles on one MOOC. Data analysis used Tynj√§l√§‚Äôs model of integrative pedagogy to identify the different types of theoretical, practical, sociocultural and self-regulative knowledge needed in order to teach in a MOOC. The analysis shows that individuals did not engage in formal training (theoretical knowledge); they learned by experience; by (re-)running the MOOC and from learners‚Äô feedback (practical knowledge). They also reflected on their learning experience, on their contact with different cultures, on engaging with ideas from other MOOCs and people (self-regulative knowledge). They worked collaboratively, sharing expertise, but sometimes found communication with colleagues was difficult (sociocultural knowledge). When they faced challenges they integrated theoretical, practical and self-regulative knowledge to solve problems (mediating processes)	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
82909662	Influence of residual stress redistribution on fatigue crack growth and damage tolerant design	The safe operation of many structures and components is ensured through the operation of damage tolerant design and evaluation. Substantial residual stresses can exist in many systems and it is important that these are incorporated in damage tolerance calculations of fatigue crack growth. Recent improvements in non-destructive measurement techniques and in the application of weight or Green's functions methods of including residual stress fields into stress intensity factor (SIF) calculations have enabled predictions of the effects of residual stresses on fatigue crack propagation to be made more readily. Two examples from the aerospace industry, structures containing (i) cold expanded holes and (ii) fusion welds are used to show that presently, although final crack growth lives can be accurately predicted, the details of crack growth are not well represented with initial growth typically being underestimated and later growth being over estimated. It is shown that this is most likely to be due to residual stress redistribution. and that this must be built into fatigue life prediction models if accurate damage tolerance based procedures are to be developed for components and systems containing substantial residual stresses	['SDG09']

This article explores the results of implementing Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) in a HEI in Greece. Specifically, the results of two surveys, focusing on students‚Äô perceptions in the University of the Aegean, are presented and analysed. The surveys were conducted prior and after the implementation of an EMS in the University. The survey results demonstrate several positive consequences from the implementation of EMS across the University campus.

82982700	Exploring attitudes and practices of General Practice staff towards offers of opportunistic screening for chlamydia: a UK survey	This study applied a theory-based questionnaire to examine the behaviours and beliefs of all practice staff who may be involved in offering chlamydia screens to young people aged 15-25 years old. We aimed to identify potential influencing factors and examine the organisational constraints, which may be amenable to change. The National Chlamydia Screening Programme offers opportunistic screening to men and women between 15 and 25 years old who have ever had sexual intercourse and primary care is the second largest source of screens. In England 15.9 of the target group were screened against a target of 17 in 2008. Interventions to improve the frequency of offers have shown effects with volunteer practices. A survey of 85 General Practices was completed by 55 doctors, nurses and receptionists. Interviews were conducted with 12 staff from three practices. Respondents were unable to identify the national screening target. Only half record if a patient is sexually active. Half the sample had some recollection of the frequency of offers they made, with a mean of 4 per month. These were predominantly in consultations concerning sexual health. Perceived social norms are favourable to screening and respondents have strong perceived control over offering screens, including to those under 16 who are sexually active. Attitudes towards screening were positive but disadvantages and barriers related to increased pressure on practice resources for longer consultations and contact tracing. There were no differences in beliefs and practice behaviours between medical and nursing staff. Future interventions should be targeted at increasing the range of consultations in which offers are made, demonstrating how to make offers without increasing consultation time, providing more complete records of sexual activity, screens and results, and encouraging audit and review within the practice to promote practice wide approaches to increasing opportunistic screening	['SDG10', 'SDG03']

Documentary analysis of major incident plan and other written materials.Results: The incident posed considerable managerial and clinical problems and this paper describes how they were overcome. In particular, strategies for dealing with supply (of staff, beds, and resources) and managing demand (by liaising with primary care and the public) seem to have been successful. Many functions necessary for managing the incident were poorly dealt with in the plan, especially procedures for handling the news media and liaison with agencies outside the hospital. Lack of explicit guidance appeared not to hinder the organisational response. There may have been an unspoken high level decision to allow staff to draw on their skills and experience in improvising a response to the initial challenge and learning adaptively as the incident unfolded. There was also evidence that staff disregarded existing job and role boundaries and focused instead on tasks, working flexibly to ensure that these tasks were completed.Conclusions: Protracted major incidents pose particular management challenges and may benefit from an approach different from that set out in typical major incident plans. Staff must be able to act flexibly and responsively. Some form of checklist or toolkit may be preferable to a detailed plan for some types of incident	['SDG03']
82976738	Using artefacts to mediate understanding in design conversations	The journey from the concept of a building to the actual built form is mediated with the use of various artefacts, such as drawings, product samples and models. These artefacts are produced for different purposes and for people with different levels of understanding of the design and construction processes. This paper studies design practice as it occurs naturally in a real-world situation by observing the conversations that surround the use of artefacts at the early stages of a building's design. Drawing on ethnographic data, insights are given into how the use of artefacts can reveal a participant's understanding of the scheme. The appropriateness of the method of conversation analysis to reveal the users' understanding of a scheme is explored by observing spoken micro-interactional behaviours. It is shown that the users' understanding of the design was developed in the conversations around the use of artefacts, as well as the knowledge that is embedded in the artefacts themselves. The users' confidence in the appearance of the building was considered to be gained in conversation, rather than the ability of the artefacts to represent a future reality	['SDG11']
82982690	An exploration of the psychological factors affecting remote e-worker's job effectiveness, well-being and work-life balance	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of remote e-working on the key research areas of work-life balance, job effectiveness and well-being. The study provides a set of generalisable themes drawn from the key research areas, including building trust, management style and the quality of work and non-working life. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is an exploratory study into the psychological factors affecting remote e-workers using qualitative thematic analysis of eleven in-depth interviews with e-workers, across five organisations and three sectors. All participants worked remotely using technology independent of time and location for several years and considered themselves to be experts. Findings: The paper provides insights into the diverse factors affecting remote e-workers and produces ten emerging themes. Differentiating factors between e-workers included access to technology, ability to work flexibly and individual competencies. Adverse impacts were found on well-being, due to over-working and a lack of time for recuperation. Trust and management style were found to be key influences on e-worker effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: Because of the exploratory nature of the research and approach the research requires further testing for generalisability. The emerging themes could be used to develop a wide-scale survey of e-workers, whereby the themes would be further validated. Practical implications: Practical working examples are provided by the e-workers and those who also manage e-workers based on the ten emerging themes. Originality/value: This paper identifies a number of generalisable themes that can be used to inform the psychological factors affecting remote e-worker effectiveness	['SDG03', 'SDG08', 'SDG10']

82906710	Ameliorative missing value imputation for robust biological knowledge inference	Gene expression data is widely used in various post genomic analyses. The data is often probed using microarrays due to their ability to simultaneously measure the expressions of thousands of genes. The expression data, however, contains significant numbers of missing values, which can impact on subsequent biological analysis. To minimize the impact of these missing values, several imputation algorithms including Collateral Missing Value Estimation (CMVE), Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (BPCA), Least Square Impute (LSImpute), Local Least Square Impute (LLSImpute), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) have been proposed. These algorithms, however, exploit either only the global or local correlation structure of the data, which normally can lead to higher estimation errors. This paper presents an Ameliorative Missing Value Imputation (AMVI) technique which has ability to exploit global/local and positive/negative correlations in a given dataset by automatic selection of the optimal number of predictor genes k using a wrapper non-parametric method based on Monte Carlo simulations. The AMVI technique has CMVE strategy at its core because CMVE has demonstrated improved performance compared to both low variance methods like BPCA, LLSImpute, and high variance methods such as KNN and ZeroImpute, as CMVE exploits positive/negative correlations. The performance of AMVI is compared with CMVE, BPCA, LLSImpute, and KNN by randomly removing between 1% and 15% missing values in eight different ovarian, breast cancer and yeast datasets. Together with the standard NRMS error metric, the True Positive (TP) rate of the significant genes selection, biological significance of the selected genes and the statistical significance test results are presented to investigate the impact of missing values on subsequent biological analysis. The enhanced performance of AMVI was demonstrated by its lower NRMS error, improved TP rate, bio significance of the selected genes and statistical significance test results, when compared with the aforementioned imputation methods across all the datasets. The results show that AMVI adapted to the latent correlation structure of the data and proved to be an effective and robust approach compared with the trial and error methodology for selecting k. The results confirmed that AMVI can be successfully applied to accurately impute missing values prior to any microarray data analysis	['SDG03', 'SDG09']
82906661	Descent motions of the Huygens probe as measured by the Surface Science Package (SSP): Turbulent evidence for a cloud layer	The Huygens probe underwent vigorous short-period motions during its parachute descent through the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan in January 2005, at least some of which were excited by the Titan environment. Several sensors in the Huygens Surface Science Package (SSP) detect these motions, indicating the transition to the smaller stabilizer parachute, the changing probe spin rate, aerodynamic buffeting, and pendulum motions. Notably, in an altitude range of about 20‚Äì30 km where methane drops will freeze, the frequency content and statistical kurtosis of the tilt data indicate excitation by turbulent air motions like those observed in freezing clouds on Earth, supporting the suggestion of Tokano et al.

Motions are weak below 20 km, suggesting a quiescent lower atmosphere with turbulent fluctuations of nominally <0.15 m/s (to within a factor of 2) but more violent motions in the upper troposphere may have been excited by turbulent winds with amplitudes of 1‚Äì2 m/s. Descent in part of the stratosphere (150‚Äì120 km) was smooth despite strong ambient wind (100 m/s), but known anomalies in the probe spin prevent investigation of turbulence in the known wind-shear layer from 60 to 100 km	['SDG13']

A questionnaire was constructed based on a model derived from the motivation literature to examine students' responses on 16 constructs related to motivation. This was administered to 228 students in years 7, 8 and 9. The analysis revealed a decrease in motivation with age, and higher level of motivation among girls than boys. It also revealed a strikingly higher motivation to learn German than French, which was even more marked when the boys onl1, were considered. These findings were further investigated using interviews. Both girls and boys were able to provide clear explanations for differences between the genders, as well as for the language differences. These included such aspects as French being considered feminine, it not being `cool' for boys to be seen to make an effort at French, and the tendency for boys not to try at anything that appears to be tedious	['SDG04']

This chapter examines media discourse on income inequality over time to understand better the agenda-setting process in the public sphere. Media issue attention measures are one part of an agenda-setting approach to social problems, which assesses the flow of salience from mass media to public perception and ultimately into government action. Some of the increase in media coverage may simply be picking up on this growing number of academic studies, especially when they are undertaken by major research bodies that cultivate media relations and prepare press releases	['SDG10']
82911164	Does concurrent prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs substantially increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding?	Background:A 15-fold increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported with concurrent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Recent guidance cautions against concurrent prescription, particularly in older people. Aim: To quantify the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with current exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and both drugs concurrently. Methods: We conducted a case-control analysis of 11 261 cases with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 53 156 controls matched by gender, age and general practice from computerized primary care data. We coupled this with self-controlled case series analysis. Results: Both drugs were associated with a twofold increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (odds ratio =2.38, 95% confidence interval 2.08-2.72 for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and odds ratio = 2.15, 95% confidence interval 2.02-2.28 for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). This increased risk was marginally higher for concurrent prescription (odds ratio = 2.93, 95%confidence interval 2.25-3.82). The self-controlled analysis showed a greater incidence rate ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (2.71, 95% confidence interval 2.51-2.91) and lower incidence rate ratio with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.48-1.98). The incidence rate ratio when both drugs were combined was 3.25, 95% confidence interval 1.95-5.42. Estimates were similar after restricting to people over 80 years of age. Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was not specifically related to class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was similar when we looked at tricyclic anti-depressants. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is not substantially increased when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are prescribed together, compared with their use alone	['SDG03']
549010663	Appeals to consensus and partisan politics in parliamentary discourse on the pandemic	This paper explores the ways in which political leaders appeal to consensus and unity in parliamentary discourse on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece.  The paper focuses a) on the different meanings that consensus takes in different argumentative contexts, b) on the mobilization of (different constructions of) consensus as a discursive resource oriented to different rhetorical ends. Moreover, it considers the potential implications of appeals to consensus on partisan politics, anchoring the whole discussion both in approaches to political discourse as rhetoric (Billig, 1987) and political communication (Tileaga, Demasi & Burke, 2020), as well as, in research regarding political leadership during COVID-19	['SDG16', 'SDG03']

Based on a public value model, we map how commissioners can go beyond traditional consultation and participation processes to achieve co-commissioning with citizens. Moreover, we discuss how public sector organizations can use their strategic commissioning process to support and embed citizen voice and action in their problem prevention, treatment and rehabilitation strategies to achieve the quality of life outcomes desired by both citizens and public service commissioners.Commissioning as a planning, resource mobilization and prioritization activity needs to harness user and community co-production of public services and outcomes.

82980088	Editorial: Perspectives on creative pedagogy: exploring challenges, possibilities and potential	Internationally, the first decade of the 21st century was characterised by growth in creativity research and creative classroom practice (e.g.  Einarsdottir, 2003; Cremin, Burnard and Craft, 2006; Beghetto and Kaufman 2007; Sawyer, 2010). In England, the Creative Partnerships initiative increased the attention paid by researchers, policy makers and practitioners to creativity in schooling, and  an interest in creative learning at the primary phase developed (e.g. QCA, 2005; Galton, 2008; Bragg,  Manchester and Faulkner, 2009; Thomson and Hall, 2007; Craft and Chappell, 2009). Whilst recognition of the role and nature of creativity and interest in creative pedagogical practice has grown, tensions persist at several levels, particularly in accountability cultures, where international comparisons such as PISA and PIRLS frame and shape policy, practice and curricula.This Special Issue, planned with Anna Craft before her untimely death, responds to this context and draws together the work of a number of eminent scholars of creativity and creative pedagogies. It offers diverse perspectives from Colombia, Denmark, England, France, Poland, Hong Kong, and the USA and highlights differences as well as similarities across cultural contexts. Individually and collectively, the authors, framed by their own stances on creativity, reveal both the complexities and the possibilities of creative pedagogies. While some focus more upon conceptual challenges, others examine classroom practice, both teachers and visiting artists, and identify difficulties as well as potential. Most pay attention to both teacher and learner orientations, exemplified by Dezuanni and Jetnikoff‚Äòs (2011:265) assertion that creative pedagogies involve ‚Äòimaginative and innovative arrangement of curricula and teaching strategies in school classrooms‚Äô to develop the creativity of the young	['SDG04']
487610972	The performance of hearing-impaired children on handedness and perceptual motor tasks	The present study was designed to test for differences, if any, in children with impaired hearing compared with a control group of children with normal hearing (7-11-year-olds) in handedness, drawing, categorization, facial recognition, and play. Results indicated age differences in the performance of all the tasks. The children with hearing loss had more left-hand responses than the normal children did. For drawings, those whose hearing was impaired used more space and color. Both groups performed similarly on tasks of categorization and facial recognition. For play, children with hearing loss were more clumsy and accident prone than children in the control group. The results suggest that children with impaired hearing differ from those with normal hearing in tasks that are influenced by language processes and motor ability	['SDG10', 'SDG04']
82982109	Enhancing (in)formal learning ties in interdisciplinary management courses: a quasi-experimental social network study	While interdisciplinary courses are regarded as a promising method for students to apply knowledge from other disciplines, there is limited empirical evidence available whether interdisciplinary courses can effectively ‚Äúcreate‚Äù interdisciplinary students. In this quasi-experimental study amongst 377 Master‚Äôs students, in the control condition students were randomised by the teacher into groups, while in the experimental condition students were ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù by the teacher into groups based upon their initial social network. Using Social Network Analysis, learning ties after eleven weeks were significantly predicted by the friendship and learning ties established at the beginning of the course, as well as (same) discipline and group allocation. The effects were generally greater than group divisions, irrespective of the two conditions, but substantially smaller than initial social networks. These results indicate that interdisciplinary learning does not occur ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù in an interdisciplinary module. This study contributes to effective learning in interdisciplinary learning environments	['SDG04']
82921791	Approaches to studying and perceptions of the academic environment among university students in China	It has been claimed that students from ‚ÄúConfucian-heritage‚Äù cultures approach studying in higher education differently from Western students. This study investigated the experiences and the approaches to studying of students at a university in China. A total of 356 students completed both the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) and the Revised Approaches to Studying Inventory (RASI). Their responses to the CEQ yielded two factors concerned with student support and course demands. Their responses to the RASI yielded two factors: a deep/strategic approach and a surface approach. Students who rated their courses positively in terms of student support were more likely to adopt a deep/strategic approach. Students who rated their courses positively in terms of course demands were less likely to adopt a surface approach. In broad terms, the students‚Äô perceptions and approaches to studying were similar to those of Western students, though with some specific differences. The findings add to the literature on Chinese students‚Äô approaches to learning and also have practical implications for teachers seeking to promote more desirable forms of studying in their students	['SDG04']
160752087	Navigating double marginalisation: Migrant Chinese sexual and gender minority young people‚Äôs views on mental health challenges and supports	Sexual and/or gender minority young people who are also members of an ethnic minority can experience unique challenges. Limited research draws directly on the mental health experiences of these ‚Äòdouble minority‚Äô youth. This study focused on Chinese sexual/gender minority youth in New Zealand. It sought to explore features they found challenging for, or supportive of, their mental health and wellbeing. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 Chinese sexual/gender minority participants aged between 19 and 29 years old and residing in Auckland, New Zealand. An inductive approach to qualitative data analysis was used. Two major domains of findings emerged. Firstly, participants described mental health challenges linked to racism, sexism, cis-heteronormativity and challenges in relation to intersecting identities. Secondly, Chinese culture and community connections, family and peer support, and role models seemed to facilitate resiliency. However, the fear of ‚Äòlosing face‚Äô, unwillingness to disclose distress when unwell, and mental health service providers‚Äô lack of cultural and linguistic competency were described as barriers to effective mental health support. In conclusion, Chinese and sexual/gender minority identities were integral parts of participants‚Äô sense of self, and this was associated with their mental health and wellbeing. Further research is required to explore ways to reduce barriers and promote resiliency	['SDG03', 'SDG10']
82921265	8008: The measure of a competent child care social worker?	This paper reflects upon some mixed messages found in recent consultation and framework documents that have been issued as part of the debate surrounding the Government's emphasis upon education and training within its 'modernisation' agenda. It identifies the long-standing arguments about 'testing' versus 'learning' or 'contextual' paradigms and suggests that, perhaps, there is still scope to influence the future direction of social work. The author has drawn upon his research with social workers and their team managers in current post-qualification award programmes to argue for a renewed emphasis upon the inter-personal and relationship aspects of educational processes within more broadly conceived socio-cultural contexts. A focus upon reflexively defined concepts of 'engagement' and 'assessment' is used to explore constructivist arguments that locate individuals within an interplay of potential and constraints. It is argued that constructive engagements within revised conceptions of assessment can form the basis of a framework of continuing professional development that starts from and develops the unique realities of social work practice. This requires the committed involvement of more people, in the negotiation of a professional practice agenda for knowledge creation through relationships, rather than the imposition of more measures	['SDG04']
82982060	'Beyond text': exploring ethos and method in co-producing research with communities	There is a critique of research conducted in communities which fails to include communities in its design and undertaking. In parallel, academic research is increasingly being measured according to its benefit to the wider society. Co-productive research is a response to these challenges which offers a way of recognizing the resource contribution of communities to research and emphasizing the conduct of research ‚Äòwith‚Äô communities rather than ‚Äòon‚Äô communities. This article identifies the reliance on ‚Äòtext‚Äô in the research process as a barrier to delivering meaningful co-productive research with communities. ‚ÄòBeyond-text‚Äô tools are emerging across academic disciplines and include story-telling, performance, art and photography. Recent research emphasizes the empowering potential of these methods by facilitating greater reflection on the lived experience of those involved. This article looks at examples of research which have employed ‚Äòbeyond text‚Äô methods to consider their potential to deliver co-produced research with communities. It also asks whether it is the application of specific technical approaches and methods, or the underlying ethos within which research is conducted that is most critical to challenging unequal power relationships. It argues that beyond-text methods need to be applied within a wider set of values which re-conceptualize the role of the researcher working with communities	['SDG04']
158977758	Engaging Stakeholders Through Corporate Political Activity: Insights From MNE Nonmarket Strategy in an Emerging African Market	As interest increases in the political engagement between multinational enterprises (MNEs) andemerging economy host governments, less is known about wider MNE stakeholder engagementand the development of nonmarket capabilities in institutionally fragile environments. This studyinvestigates how MNEs engage stakeholders through corporate political activity (CPA) during thepro-market reform of Uganda's electricity generation sector. Data is collected through semi-structured interviews, archival materials and Ô¨Åeldwork notes, and is analyzed using an NVivo-supported grounded analytic method. We Ô¨Ånd both proactive and reactive leveraging of CPA tomanage diverse stakeholders. We argue that the host government remains the most importantpolitical stakeholder in the early phases of reform, but changes in institutional and politicalenvironments necessitate strategic adaptations as the reform process progresses. These adapta-tions include the need for local engagement and the accommodation of multi-level stakeholderpressures. Our Ô¨Åndings contribute to an understanding of corporate political capabilities inAfrica's emerging markets, and illustrate how these capabilities can be strategically leveraged toeÔ¨Äectively manage diverse stakeholders	['SDG17', 'SDG09']
187114324	The emerging trend of blockchain for validating degree apprenticeship certification in cybersecurity education	The network-centric world of the 21st century and explosive growth of the internet related technologies brought modern cybersecurity culture with complex threat landscape in the Higher Education environment. Cybersecurity landscape is always changing and education providers often do not have remit or in fact the means and capacity to cover the range of activities learners engage with, which attest their achievements, knowledge, and skills. Currently the awarding and validation of qualifications occurs exclusively under centralised management of an education institution or an employer take more ownership of the learning experience and its outcomes without compromising on safety, security, and accessibility. The centralised model of the present awarding and validation is no longer sustainable because learning happens increasingly on online platforms, and learning is far more international than it used to be. Key higher educational providers introduced degree apprenticeships which are new way to ‚Äòdo both‚Äô higher level skills and provide progression routes to improve their employability prospects. The ‚ÄòBlockchain‚Äô (BC) facilitates digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It embraces a set of inter-related technologies. This paper expounds a novel BC-based architecture for transform centralised model of awarding and validation in to decentralized ledger of secured database. This database is shared, replicated, and synchronized for validation among the universities, partner institutions, professionals, statutory or regulatory bodies and industry bodies across the internet. The architecture offers secured collaborative validating system by qualification exchange with BC using trust methods within the decentralized topology	['SDG04', 'SDG09']

82982071	From shared roots to fruitful collaboration: How counselling psychology can benefit from (re)connecting with positive psychology	Content and focus: Counselling psychology has its origins in a positive orientation towards lifelong development, growth and prevention rather than pathology and cure. Along with the positive psychology movement, it shares its roots in humanistic psychology, and while US counselling psychology has embraced positive psychology explicitly, UK counselling psychology has been more reluctant to engage with this framework. This paper reviews the relationship between counselling psychology and positive psychology, tracing the roots of counselling psychology and its engagement with positive psychology as well as some of the barriers to fruitful interaction. We offer suggestions for how counselling psychology could beneficially (re)connect with positive psychology ideas and practices. Conclusions: By reconnecting with its positive roots and engaging with the ideas and the research of the positive psychology movement, counselling psychology could develop more balanced and strength-oriented ways of working, rekindling its original commitment towards human flourishing and actualisation	['SDG03']
160752033	Revealing the hidden geography of alternative food networks: The travelling concept of farmers‚Äô markets	Alternative food networks in post-socialist settings are often studied using concepts and analytical tools developed in the Anglo-American context. As a result, the findings tend to replicate and confirm rather than challenge and extend the extant knowledge and theorisations. Based on a recent study of farmers‚Äô markets in the Czech capital Prague, the paper claims that viewing these ‚Äòfrom the periphery‚Äô produces novel insights complementing those garnered in researching them in the West. In the context of earlier alternative food initiatives, the boom of farmers‚Äô markets, which Prague experienced in the early 2010s, was unparalleled. In less than 24 months, 41 farmers‚Äô markets were established in and around the city. Focusing methodologically on the discourse of the organisers of farmers‚Äô markets and theoretically on the complex hidden geography underlying the farmers‚Äô markets‚Äô boom, we are able to unpick the intricacy and paradoxical nature inherent in this development. While acknowledging the farmers‚Äô markets embeddedness in the local context, we argue that a more comprehensive understanding of farmers‚Äô markets requires engagement with a flow of ideas and know-how transcending the locality. The ensuing type of farmers‚Äô markets is a result of interactions among different travelling concepts as well as of their encounter with the specificities of the local post-socialist context. We argue that the fact that these concepts were not necessarily concordant with each other and also insufficiently adapted to the local context had a profound effect on Prague farmers‚Äô markets‚Äô boom	['SDG12']
82906123	How well can the theory of planned behavior account for occupational intentions?	We tested the capacity of an extended version of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to account for intentions to work for the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS) as a nurse, physiotherapist or radiographer amongst three groups: professionally unqualified (N = 507), in professional training (N = 244), and professionally qualified (N = 227). We found strong support for the three core TPB variables attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control as predictors of behavioral intention, and limited support for two additional variables: moral obligation and identification. There were some differences in the relative importance of TPB variables between groups. We conclude that the TPB has utility for more complex behaviors as well as simpler ones that are more frequently researched. However, more attention should be paid to differences in people‚Äôs circumstances, particularly regarding past vocational decisions and behavior, and to obstacles to implementing an intention	['SDG04', 'SDG08']
82914456	Liverpool '08 ‚Äì brand and contestation	This chapter examines the process of re-branding a major community - the City of Liverpool - through its role as European Capital of Culture, 2008. This year-long 'landmark event' was promoted as a means of attracting investment and tourist income. The paper assesses the implications of the Capital of Culture through its impact on one particular creative resource within that city ‚Äì the Picket music venue. The success of the bid in June 2003 created changes which impacted on some of the key creative activities within the city, threatening the legitimacy of the Capital of Culture project itself. Rapidly rising property values began to deny affordable space for the very activities which underpinned the success of the bid. The author was a participant in the subsequent three year campaign to protect the Picket venue as a resource for the training of young musicians in both artistic and technical aspects of music.The paper looks at the contestation over Liverpool and Merseyside's highly local identity and global profile and the tension and synergy between traditional collectivity and individual entrepreneurialism characterised by the forms of social enterprise currently emerging in this creative milieu. It identifies some of the collective resources held by the Liverpool community from which were drawn key tactics in the fight to retain a significant cultural resource within the Capital of Cultur	['SDG08', 'SDG11', 'SDG04']
82922685	Project portfolio management: balancing risk and performance in turbulent times	When economic conditions become more challenging, organisations have fewer resources to deploy on new business or change projects and programmes, reducing the number of such initiatives they can undertake.  However, at such times, the projects and programmes they do invest in are often more critical, since they may be essential to deliver efficiency savings, sustain revenue or improve aspects of performance on which the survival of the organisation can depend.  The current turbulent economic conditions appear to have caused increasing adoption of project portfolio management (PPM) by organisations. PPM can be defined as: managing a diverse range of projects and programmes to achieve the maximum organisational value within resource and funding constraints, where 'value' does not imply only financial value and includes delivering benefits which are relevant to the organisation's chosen strategy	['SDG09']
82906129	Usability beyond the website: an empirically-grounded e-commerce evaluation instrument for the total customer experience	A customer's experience with an e-commerce environment extends beyond the interaction with the website, including delivery of products, post-sales support, consumption of products and services, and so on. It is the total customer experience that influences the customers' perceptions of value and service quality, and which consequently affects customer loyalty. In our cross-disciplinary research in human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI) and relationship marketing, we have been investigating how HCI and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies can be integrated in the design of e-commerce so as to engender customer retention, trust and loyalty. We have performed a series of empirical studies to understand customers' requirements and perceptions about service-quality from e-shopping and e-travel environments. From these studies, we have developed an empirically-grounded evaluation instrument, E-SEQUAL, which we discuss in this paper. The development team can apply it at different phases of an e-commerce development life-cycle to integrate customers' perceived dimensions of service quality into the design and evaluation of e-commerce	['SDG08']

82902425	Responses of Amazonian ecosystems to climatic and atmospheric carbon dioxide changes since the last glacial maximum: One contribution of 17 to a Theme Issue 'Tropical forests and global atmospheric change'	The aims of this paper are to review previously published palaeovegetation and independent palaeoclimaticdatasets together with new results we present from dynamic vegetation model simulations and modernpollen rain studies to: (i) determine the responses of Amazonian ecosystems to changes in temperature,precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations that occurred since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM),ca. 21 000 years ago; and (ii) use this long-term perspective to predict the likely vegetation responses tofuture climate change. Amazonia remained predominantly forested at the LGM, although the combinationof reduced temperatures, precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations resulted in forests structurallyand floristically quite different from those of today. Cold-adapted Andean taxa mixed with rainforest taxain central areas, while dry forest species and lianas probably became important in the more seasonalsouthern Amazon forests and savannahs expanded at forest‚Äìsavannah ecotones. Net primary productivity(NPP) and canopy density were significantly lower than today. Evergreen rainforest distribution and NPPincreased during the glacialHolocene transition owing to ameliorating climatic and CO2 conditions.However, reduced precipitation in the Early‚ÄìMid-Holocene (ca. 8000‚Äì3600 years ago) caused widespread,frequent fires in seasonal southern Amazonia, causing increased abundance of drought-tolerant dry foresttaxa and savannahs in ecotonal areas. Rainforests expanded once more in the Late Holocene owing toincreased precipitation caused by greater austral summer insolation, although some of this forest expansion(e.g. in parts of the Bolivian Beni) is clearly caused by palaeo Indian landscape modification. The plantcommunities that existed during the Early‚ÄìMid-Holocene may provide insights into the kinds of vegetationresponse expected from similar increases in temperature and aridity predicted for the twenty-first century.We infer that ecotonal areas near the margins of the Amazon Basin are liable to be most sensitive tofuture environmental change and should therefore be targeted with conservation strategies that allow‚Äònatural‚Äô species movements and plant community re-assortments to occur	['SDG13', 'SDG15']

161771489	Feasibility Protocol for OER and OEP: A decision making tool for higher education	"This summary document is written for the senior executives of higher education institutions, mostly Australian institutions. It explores the Feasibility Protocol, which is a key outcome of a research project titled ""Adoption, use and management of Open Educational Resources to enhance teaching and learning in Australia"", primarily funded by the Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT), but with support from DEHub also. Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practices (OEP) have been receiving global attention, especially in the last ten years, as the demand for open resources increases in all aspects of education and knowledge sharing and distribution. Despite some important Australian initiatives and policy developments regarding OER and OEP (discussed in detail in the full project report), the lack of explicit educationally-oriented government policies appear to be limiting the process of OER adoption in Australia. To date, there have been few policy levers or enablers to encourage universities and other tertiary providers to pursue OER initiatives to better support current students, attract new ones and compete against other Australian and international institutions.We believe that the Feasibility Protocol is a valuable instrument to assist senior executives in making decisions regarding institutional adoption of OER and OEP. The Feasibility Protocol is a set of guiding principles that prompts questions and raises issues to be considered by universities and tertiary institutions wishing to take advantage of OER and OEP. More specifically, the protocol aims to assist senior executives, managers and policy makers to make informed decisions about the adoption of OER and OEP at several levels within their institution. Even though we are aware that the introduction of OER and OEP into mainstream higher education in Australia could have not only a global impact on the sector (e.g. meeting some of the Paris OER Declaration recommendations), but could also impact on small and isolated communities, as well as individuals outside the university sphere, this study is focused primarily on the higher education sector.</p"	['SDG17', 'SDG04']
82975376	Autonomy and reason: treatment choice in breast cancer	The practice of offering choice to those women with breast cancer for whom either breast conserving surgery or mastectomy would be equally beneficial, has come to be seen as an important aspect of medical care. As well as improving satisfaction with treatment, this is seen as satisfying the ethical principle of respect for autonomy.  A number of studies, however, show that women are not always comfortable with such choice, preferring to leave treatment decisions to their surgeons. A question then arises as to the extent that these women can be seen as autonomous or as exercising autonomy. This paper argues, however, that the understanding of autonomy which is applied in current approaches to breast cancer care does not adequately support the exercise of autonomy, and that the clinical context of care means that women are not able to engage in the kind of reasoning that might promote the exercise of autonomy. Where respect for autonomy is limited to informed consent and choice, there is a danger that women‚Äôs interests are overlooked in those aspects of their care where choice is not appropriate, with very real, long term consequences for some women. Promoting the exercise of autonomy, it is argued, needs to go beyond the conception of autonomy as rational individuals making their own decisions, and clinicians need to work with an understanding of autonomy as relational in order to better involve women in their care	['SDG03', 'SDG05']
82977382	<i>Besides ‚Ä¶ on the other hand</i>: using a corpus approach to explore the influence of teaching materials on Chinese students‚Äô use of linking adverbials	Studies conducted on first and second language student writing in English have pointed to the latter group's high use of features such as informal language, pronouns, and linking adverbials, yet few studies have been conducted on assessed undergraduate writing produced within an English-speaking environment. This paper reports findings from a corpus study of Chinese and British students‚Äô writing in UK universities, confirming that a key area of difference is the Chinese students‚Äô higher use of particular linking adverbials (e.g., besides, on the other hand). We hypothesize that one reason for this higher usage is the influence of secondary school teaching materials in mainland China prior to UK university study and examine a set of model texts from the English paper in the Chinese university entrance test, selected as these texts comprise much of the teaching material in the final year of secondary education. We argue that Chinese students are ‚Äúprimed‚Äù (Hoey, 2005) to favour particular linking adverbials, to disregard issues of informality, and to prefer sentence-initial positioning. It is hoped that the reported findings will challenge English language teachers and textbook writers to consider the requirements of writing within the academy	['SDG10', 'SDG04']
305114197	Inquiry-Based Learning on the Cloud	Cloud Learning Environments (CLEs) have recently emerged as a novel approach to learning, putting learners in the spotlight and providing them with the cloud-based tools for building their own learning environments according to their specific learning needs and aspirations. Although CLEs bring significant benefits to educators and learners, there is still little evidence of CLEs being actively and effectively used in the teaching and learning process. This chapter addresses this issue by introducing a European initiative called weSPOT (Working Environment with Social, Personal and Open Technologies for Inquiry-based Learning) for supporting and enhancing inquiry-based learning in STEM education via a cloud-based inquiry toolkit. The chapter presents evidence of using this toolkit within a case study that investigates how a secondary education community of students / co-learners selects information sources on the web and identifies factors associated with the reliability of information sources during their collaborative inquiry (co-inquiry) project in online environments	['SDG04', 'SDG09']
597054161	Report to Foundation Degree Forward on the impact of foundation degrees on students and the workplace	The study (commissioned by Foundation Degree Forward) was undertaken by a team of researchers from the Open University's Centre for Higher Education Research and Information and the Learning and Skills Network. It set out to explore the impact of foundation degrees from students' and employers' perspectives. By design it also aimed to build capacity among (mainly) staff in further education colleges delivering Foundation degree (Fd) 8 programmes through the involvement of Fd practitioners in the study. Many of the Fds in the study were still rather new, and some of the research findings reflect this recency. The study found that students and employers perceive a range of benefits that Fd study brings to individuals and the workplace. Full-time students cited gaining real business/industry experience, gaining broad knowledge of a specific industry, developing relevant knowledge and skills, and making contacts for future jobs as some of the benefits. Those already in employment cited getting back to learning, gaining new subject knowledge and an understanding of theories linked to, and informed by workplace practices, the development of academic skills, and gaining broader perspectives on their current work. Most students considered they had gained confidence through their studies.Employers also noted the gains in broader understandings and improved performance in the workplace. However, the study also found that employer involvement in the design and delivery of Fds was very variable. A few had been actively engaged, and practitioners acknowledged that engaging employers effectively and persuading them to take part in future developments could be a challenge. The report notes that many of the Fds involved in the study had yet to capitalise on the intended levels of integration of academic and work-based learning, and of employer engagement which are seen as some of the distinctive features of Fds	['SDG04', 'SDG08']
82983764	The Limits of Social Science: Causal Explanation and Value Relevance	What forms of knowledge can social science claim to produce? Does it employ causal analysis, and if so what does this entail? What role should values play in the work of social scientists? These are the questions addressed in this book. They are closely interrelated, and the answers offered here challenge many currently prevailing assumptions. They carry implications both for research practice, quantitative or qualitative, and for the public claims that social scientists make about the value of their work. The arguments underpinning this challenge to conventional wisdom are laid out in detail in the first half of this book. In later chapters their implications are explored for two substantive areas of intrinsic importance: the study of social mobility and educational inequalities, and explaining urban riots, notably those that took place in London and other English cities in the summer of 2011	['SDG10', 'SDG11']

82911030	Lithium, magnesium and uranium isotope behaviour in the estuarine environment of basaltic islands	This study presents major and trace elements and uranium (U), lithium (Li) and magnesium (Mg) isotope data for dissolved and suspended particulate material from estuaries draining dominantly basaltic terrains in Iceland (Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur) and Sao Miguel (Povoa√ß√£o) in the Azores archipelago. The concentrations of dissolved sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), sulphate (SO4), Mg and Li, and 7Li/6Li and 26Mg/24Mg isotope ratios vary directly as a function of the dissolved chloride concentration [Cl], indicating that these species are non-reactive in these estuaries. However, U appears to be affected either by colloid flocculation or the formation of Fe-oxyhydroxides in Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur. The major element composition of suspended particulate material in the estuary at Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur shows that the detrital silicates delivered to the estuarine mixing zone are relatively unweathered. Accordingly, the Œ¥26Mg isotope composition of the suspended material is indistinguishable from that of the parent basalts. However, the (234U/238U) activity ratios of the suspended material are significantly different from the parent basalt indicating rapid equilibration of the U isotopes between particles and seawater. The Li concentration and Œ¥7Li isotope composition of the suspended load are also observed to increase with increasing [Cl], consistent with ongoing weathering of detrital material and the formation of secondary minerals in seawater.

For twelve years New Labour as the governing party of the UK was apparently obsessed with control, ensuring as far as possible that every aspect of government policy remained centrally directed. However, there was also a growth in the use and importance of third sector agencies in the delivery, and latterly, in the strategic development of, public policy. This created an implementation gap in the delivery of policy and a problem in ensuring that key policy makers from the third sector remain ‚Äòon-message‚Äô. In this paper we will demonstrate the difficulties that existed in retaining control while decentralising the delivery and development of public policy	['SDG16']
573839917	Consumption, crime and harm at home. Regulating for what and whom?	This chapter starts by viewing home is a key site of consumption, and therefore simultaneously a site where the state, the private sector and the public sector meet at the ostensible object of regulation ‚Äì the consumer. The chapter takes several case studies involving consumption at and for the home ‚Äì examining a combination of crime, harm, victimisation and protection (or otherwise) through law and enforcement, to ask questions about the nature of regulation in contemporary corporate capitalist societies. Historically considered as a means of limiting, mitigating and prohibiting some of the harmful activities of organisations which provide goods and services, the chapter argues that regulation needs to be rethought. In the contemporary period the domestic environment is a site, process and effect of symbiotic relationships whereby harm is permitted, legitimated and, in some respects, even encouraged. As a result, the quality and longevity of life for the relatively poor are systematically diminished as the means by which the wealth of the relatively rich is augmented, and thus where established economic, political and social power relationships are maintained and reproduced	['SDG11', 'SDG16']
159108004	Exposure, Power and Impact of Food Marketing on Children: Evidence Supports Strong Restrictions	Restricting food marketing to children is a key policy issue across Europe. Numerous regulatory and self-regulatory approaches exist, but evidence suggests that sustained reductions in food marketing exposure, power or impact have not been consistently achieved by any such action to date. This article provides a narrative review of the current literature, focusing on whether, how and to what extent children in Europe are affected by marketing (particularly for unhealthy foods) across both traditional broadcast and non- broadcast (digital) media. The evidence indicates that food marketing remains widespread and influential, and that new techniques employed in digital media can increase its power and reach. Despite the research challenges associated with understanding the nature and extent of children‚Äôs exposure via personalised, targeted digital media marketing, emerging data indicate that strong policy action here is appropriate and warranted, as it is for television. This article seeks to set the context for the rest of this special issue.The WHO Set of Recommendations on the Marketing of Foods and Non-alcoholic beverages to Children1 argue that the effectiveness of marketing (i.e. the impact it has) depends upon both the level of exposure to marketing (the frequency and reach of promotions) and the power of that marketing to influence behaviour (the creative content of the marketing message, including the design, execution and use of persuasive techniques). That framework will be applied here to present the extant evidence base to support strong marketing restrictions, and highlight evidence gaps that may be impeding policy progress	['SDG02', 'SDG03']

82976726	Reservations and the determinative function of Human Rights Treaty bodies	A treaty body‚Äôs competence to determine the permissibility of a reservation elicits a wide spectrum of opinion. For years many States and observers opposed any suggestion that a treaty body might be competent to adjudge a reservation impermissible. At the same time, States have engaged in ngoing dialogues with treaty bodies over the nature of their reservations signifying some recognition that the topic in the treaty body forum is fair game. The necessity for recognising this competence stems from the passive approach historically taken by States on the issue of reservations to human rights treaties. This passivity has contributed to the general incoherence of the human rights treaty system as evidenced by the large number of seemingly invalid reservations which remain attached to the core human rights treaties. The recent endorsement of this competence by the ILC is clearly a boon to human rights yet it yields only cautious optimism in light of the non-binding nature of treaty body jurisprudence. This article outlines the increasingly dynamic role of human rights treaty bodies and argues that recognising the derminative function of these organs increases coherence in the international human rights system by providing definitive views on the permissibility of reservations	['SDG16']
157841572	Migrant mothers: Performing kin work and belonging across private and public boundaries	This article explores how migrant mothering kin work challenges private and public boundaries, giving rise to new conceptions and practices of citizenship. We highlight the potential of participatory theatre methods - specifically, forum theatre and Playback ‚Äì for understanding the relationship between mothering, ethnic belonging and citizenship. We also assess the significance of migrant women‚Äôs kin work within their families and communities for re-framing notions of citizenship (Erel et al, 2017a, 2018). Our analysis gives particular focus to two scenes developed as part of the participatory theatre project that took place with a group of ethnically and racially diverse mothers in East London. The first scene, entitled ‚ÄòWhere is my food?‚Äô, draws attention to the mothers‚Äô kin work and reproductive labour operating at the boundaries of the public/private dichotomy, and also highlights gendered household dynamics. The second scene, entitled ‚ÄòAt the community centre‚Äô, examines everyday encounters at the centre, and how ‚Äòcultural work‚Äô, which is pivotal to the mothers‚Äô kin work, informs intergenerational relations. The article argues for a more embodied understanding of citizenship in order to broaden understanding of migrant mothers‚Äô kin work in making new citizens	['SDG10', 'SDG05']
82978227	Social capital indicators and environmental policies for protected areas	Social capital is an important factor influencing several issues both in individual and collective level. Various indicators have been presented in the relevant literature for its measurement. The most commonly known are: social trust, institutional trust, social networks and social norms. The aim of the chapter is to analyze social capital indicators and to underline their connection with the development of environmental policies. Specifically the influence of social capital indicators on different environmental policy instruments will be presented. Through this analysis the importance of exploring social capital during the formation of environmental policies and the need to develop measurement techniques for this purpose is highlighted. The above issues will also be explored taking as an example environmental policies for the protection of areas with high biodiversity value	['SDG15', 'SDG17']
82976537	Forecasting large explosions at Bezymianny Volcano using thermal satellite data	Large volcanic explosions pose a severe risk to life and cargo by injecting ash into local and international air traffic routes. Prior to exploding, Bezymianny (Kamchatka) commonly shows an increase in lava extrusion rate, which can be detected by satellites as an increase in thermal radiance. Here we present the first method of forecasting explosive eruptions based solely on satellite data. A pattern recognition algorithm using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data has been developed based on known precursory trends of increasing radiance prior to 19 explosions at Bezymianny Volcano in 1993‚Äì2008. The algorithm retrospectively forecasts 89% of the explosions (100% of the explosions that show precursory increases in thermal radiance), with 71% of alerts issued in the 30 days beforehand. The method also provides the probability of an explosion occurring within a given number of days after an alert is triggered by the algorithm. When applied to independent data, the algorithm correctly provided alerts before the 16 December 2009, 31 May 2010 and 13 April 2011 explosions	['SDG01', 'SDG11', 'SDG13']
523283176	Cyberstalking: Investigating formal intervention and the role of Corporate Social Responsibility	ContextOnline harassment and stalking have been identified with growing accordance as anti-social behaviours, potentially with extreme consequences including indirect or direct physical injury, emotional distress and/or financial loss.ObjectiveAs part of our ongoing work to research and establish better understanding of cyberstalking, this study aims to investigate the role of Police, Mobile Operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and owners/administrators of online platforms (e.g. websites, chatrooms) in terms of intervention in response to offences. We ask to what different authorities do people report incidents of cyberstalking? Do these authorities provide satisfactory responses or interventions? And how can this be improved? Furthermore, we discuss the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to encourage the implementation of cyberstalking-aware schemes by service providers to support victims. In addition, CSR can be used as a means to measure the effects of externality factor in dictating the relationship between the impact of a given individuals‚Äô privacy loss and strategic decisions on investment to security controls in an organisational context.MethodA mixed method design has been used in this study. Data collection took place by means of an online survey made available for three years to record both qualitative and quantitative data. Overall, 305 participants responded from which 274 identified themselves as victims of online harassment.ResultOur results suggest that most offences were communicated through private channels such as emails and/or mobile texts/calls. A significant number of victims did not report this to their service provider because they did not know they could. While Police were recognised as the first-point-of-contact in such cases, 41.6% of our sample did not contact the Police due to reasons such as fear of escalation, guilt/sympathy and self-blaming. Experiences from those who have reported offences to service providers demonstrate that no or very little support was offered. Overall, the majority of participants shared the view that third-party intervention is required on their behalf in order to mitigate risks associated with cyberstalking. An independent specialist anti-stalking organisation was a popular choice to act on their behalf followed by the Police and network providers.ConclusionIncidents are taking place on channels owned and controlled by large, cross-border international companies providing mobile services, webmail and social networking. The lack of support offered to victims in many cases of cyberstalking can be identified as Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI). We anticipate that awareness should be raised as regarding service providers‚Äô liability and social responsibility towards adopting better strategies	['SDG16', 'SDG05']
82977595	Beyond the enclave: towards a critical political economy of China and Africa	This article provides a political economy framework for analysing China‚Äôs engagements with Africa. It situates the rise of China in the context of the changing balance of power in the world system and particularly China‚Äôs re-entry into spheres of influence in Africa that have been the purview of the former European colonial powers for two centuries or more. It begins by arguing that current approaches to China, Africa and international relations are fragmented in particular ways which prevents the development of a more critical political economy. It then examines a pervasive theme in China‚ÄìAfrica relations, which assumes that the Chinese work through enclaved investments to secure the resources of low-income economies, though in this sense the Chinese are no different from other investors. Where they do differ is in their bundling of aid, trade and FDI and their use of imported labour, which has been termed ‚Äòsurgical colonialism‚Äô. The article does not dispute the existence of Chinese enclaves, but argues that we need more empirical evidence on the levels of labour importation in relation to local labour market conditions. This requires a more nuanced understanding of state‚Äìcapital dynamics in those countries where the Chinese operate although the model appears to be one of elite brokerage. However, the enclaved investments and inter-elite bargaining are only part of the story and the closing sections analyse the role of independent Chinese businesses in Africa‚Äôs social and political development, which moves us beyond the enclave	['SDG17', 'SDG08', 'SDG09']
82911762	Identifying indicators of atmospheric nitrogen deposition impacts in acid grasslands	Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen has become a serious concern for nature conservation managers and policy makers. It has the potential to reduce species richness, increase the graminoid component of the sward, encourage species typical of more fertile conditions and alter the soil biogeochemistry of grasslands. Calcifugous grasslands (grasslands found on acid soils) are among the most sensitive to N deposition due to their poorly buffered soils and species typical of nutrient poor environments.Indicators have an important role to play in detecting the impact of nitrogen deposition on sites of conservation importance and assessing conservation status. This study investigates potential indicators of nitrogen deposition impacts that could be incorporated into site condition monitoring programmes such as the UK Common Standards Monitoring.Using two national surveys of calcifugous grasslands we examined the potential for using: the presence or absence of indicator species, the cover of indicator species, the species richness and richness of functional groups, and the cover of functional groups as indicators of N deposition impacts. Of all the potential indicators investigated, graminoid:forb ratio was found to be the best indicator of N deposition impacts. It showed a significant relationship to N deposition in both data sets and is quick and easy to assess in the field. Vegetation indicators must be used with caution as there is potential for vegetation management regime and nutrients from other sources to cause similar changes in species composition. Consideration must be given to these before attributing changes to nitrogen deposition	['SDG13', 'SDG15']

82911767	LGBT Issues: Looking beyond categories	A thought-provoking resource for anyone concerned with sexuality and gender identity in health and social care settings. Drawing on current research and debates, the contributors explore some of the tensions between the different ways in which sexuality is understood and experienced. A focus of the book is on how categories like ‚Äòlesbian‚Äô, ‚Äògay‚Äô, ‚Äòbisexual‚Äô, and ‚Äòtrans‚Äô shape everyday practice and service use. It looks at the circumstances in which people choose to describe themselves with these identity labels and the situations in which they reject or feel constrained by them. A particular feature of the book is its combination of a nuanced understanding of the nature of sexual identities with practice-relevant and grounded examples taken from health and social care settings, with a Scottish focus.Intended primarily for a practitioner audience and for those studying in the field of health and social care this volume will also interest academics and an international audience because of its distinctive theoretical sophistication about the nature of sexual identities	['SDG03', 'SDG05']

82978268	Sources of colloidal and dissolved loads over the hydrological cycle in Siberian rivers	High latitude permafrost-dominated areas such as Central Siberia present an atypical hydrological cycle punctuated by an important spring flood resulting from snow melting. However, chemical variations in river waters associated to these hydrological variations are rarely taken into account in environmental geochemistry studies. This study aims to work out how the highly contrasted hydrological cycle and the presence of permafrost influence the temporal pattern of chemical element migration. For this purpose, major and trace element concentrations as well as Sr and U isotopic ratios were analyzed in the dissolved load of two Siberian rivers regularly sampled over two hydrological cycles (2005-2007), Nizhniya Tunguska and Kochchumo rivers, following the classical approaches used in the lab (e.g. [1]). Our results highlight that DOC and traditionnaly insoluble elements such as Al and Fe, but also REE and Th, are mobilized as a major colloidal flux at the spring flood and to a lesser extent during the summer period. The data show the occurrence of two colloid sources, successively involved over time: during the spring flood, the main source of colloids is the uppermost organic soil horizon whereas later in summer colloids come mainly from deeper soil compartments. Similarly, the results point out that the dissolved load of these rivers have to be explained in terms of mixing between deep underground brines that dominate during winter and a summer suprapermafrost flow draining deep soils, with a minor contribution of shallow soil layers during spring flood. It is critical to consider these temporal variations in the intensity and in the nature of dissolved geochemical flux in order to establish reliable chemical budgets and to evaluate weathering rates in boreal regions	['SDG13', 'SDG14', 'SDG06']

Their atmospheric concentrations were determined based on short-term sampling, in different sites of Cluj-Napoca, a highly populated urban centre in N-W Romania, with numerous and diversified road vehicles with internal combustion engines. The method is relatively inexpensive and simple and shows good precision and linearity in the ranges of 7‚Äì60 Œºg/m3 (B), 13‚Äì90 Œºg/m3 (T), 7‚Äì50 Œºg/m3 (E), 10‚Äì70 Œºg/m3 (X-m,p), and 20‚Äì130 Œºg/m3 (X-o). The limits of quantitation/detection of the method LOQ/LOD are of 10/5 Œºg/m3 (Xo), 5/3 Œºg/m3 (B, E, X-m,p), and of 3/1 Œºg/m3 (T), respectively	['SDG11', 'SDG03']

82978257	Research review: Childhood maltreatment and executive functioning during adolescence	Research over the past decade indicates that adolescents who have experienced childhood maltreatment have more emotional and behavioural disturbances and less socially desirable or adaptive behaviours than typically developing adolescents. These difficulties are consistent with weaknesses in executive functioning skills. Executive functioning (EF), which involves higher order thinking and reasoning skills, is considered to be critically important for complex human behaviour. Adolescence is a period of marked neurodevelopmental change, particularly in the regions of the brain that deals with EF. During this period youngsters are in the process of acquiring higher-order, abstract cognitive skills as well as coping with the normal pressures of teenage life. EF skills may therefore be critical at this time and may explain the cognitive and behavioural difficulties that maltreated adolescents‚Äô experience. However, despite evidence to suggest that the overwhelming stress of childhood maltreatment leads to adverse effects on brain development, research into maltreatment and EF is still limited, particularly using adolescent samples. After a brief introduction to childhood maltreatment, an overview of recent findings will be provided, with first a consideration of the general effects of maltreatment on cognitive achievements and behavioural regulation, followed by an examination of the role of developmental period, severity and type of abuse. Theories about EF will then be outlined, concluding with a consideration of the effects of maltreatment specifically on EF	['SDG16', 'SDG03', 'SDG04']
82978267	Seasonal variations of chemical composition of soil porewaters, streams and rivers in basaltic watersheds of central Siberia: the origin of river dissolved load in the permafrost zone	Rivers and streams draining basalts in Central Siberia allow thorough evaluation of the intensity of chemical weathering and its potential change induced by permafrost degradation. In order to get new insights to the origin of dissolved and suspended matter in this important subarctic region, we follow continuously over 4 years the chemical composition of dissolved load in two large rivers (N. Tunguska and Kochechumo), small experimental watershed (Kulingdakan) in the Yenissey River Basin and interstitial soils solutions from different landscape positions and soil horizons. The site (Tura, 64oN, 100oE) offers a unique opportunity for studying the processes occurring at high and low permafrost distribution watersheds. Indeed, at global scale we deal with two equivalent size rivers draining the northern and southern part of the Central Siberia (Kochechumo River and N. Tunguska River, respectively). At the local scale, there are north-facing and south-facing slopes of the watershed that receive equivalent precipitation but exhibit totally different heat input and consequently above-ground biomass and active layer thickness. There is a clear and strongly pronounced seasonal variability in trace and major elements concentration and organic carbon (OC) over the hydrological cycle with most of OC and trace element flux occurring during the spring flood. In summer time, the north-facing slope acts as a primary source of water and dissolved elements to the river as it exhibits the lowest thickness of the active layer. Indeed, the chemical composition of the suprapermafrost flow and that of the river water are very similar. In contrast, the south-facing slopes, although they exhibit twice higher concentrations of OC and TE in porewaters, do not deliver enough fluids to the river as these fluids are fully absorbed by thick active layer, mosses and vascular vegetation. Nevertheless, in early spring, the degradation products of plant litter from the S-facing slopes are abundant in stream waters. In winter time, when all soil fluid migration is stopped and the small rivers are fully frozen, the main source of solutes to the large rivers become groundwaters located in the thawed zone below the river channel. In collaboration with other researches, our results should allow quantitative modeling of the evolution of large boreal continental systems under global warming accompanied by the shift from the permafrost-dominating to permafrost-free environments	['SDG13', 'SDG14', 'SDG15', 'SDG06']

574734472	The Influence of Gender Dynamics on Women‚Äôs Experiences in Martial Arts: A Scoping Review	Women are underrepresented in martial arts participation compared to men. The aim of this scoping review was to understand how gender dynamics influence women‚Äôs experiences of martial arts, in order to inform future interventions and policies which could increase the participation of women in martial arts. Fifty-three studies were eligible for inclusion and thematic analysis was used to identify they key themes across the literature. The seven themes identified included: martial arts as a tool for improving gender relations, use of martial arts to challenge societal gender norms, women‚Äôs empowerment through martial arts training, problematic mixed-gender contact, expectation for women to conform to gender norms, martial arts as men‚Äôs space, and patriarchy in martial arts. Overall whilst there was evidence some women had positive experiences of gender dynamics in martial arts, and that women‚Äôs experiences are improving over time, the review highlighted that women can be excluded from martial arts as a result of traditional hierarchies, gender norms and problems associated with mixed-gender contact	['SDG10', 'SDG05']
82982973	Perceptions of the learning environment, learning preferences, and approaches to studying among medical students in Pakistan	Students at a Pakistani medical college were surveyed using instruments taken from Western research. The students who rated their courses positively tended to adopt an organised approach in their learning and studying. The students who perceived that their assessment and workload were inappropriate preferred a transmissive approach to teaching and adopted a surface approach in their learning and studying. The students who preferred a student-centred approach to teaching tended to adopt a deep approach in their learning and studying. This confirms the idea, well established in Western research, that there exists a strong relationship between students‚Äô perceptions of their courses and the approaches that they adopt on those courses. However, the incorporation of problem-based learning in the medical curriculum had not led to any enhancement of their perceptions and preferences, nor had it led to an unambiguous improvement in their approaches to studying. This is attributed to the hybrid nature of their programmes, in which problem-based activities were combined with more conventional forms of teaching and assessment, and to the anxiety and stress which seem to be common among students at medical schools in Pakistan	['SDG03', 'SDG04']
82904318	Towards sustainable higher education: environmental impacts of conventional campus, print-based and electronic/open learning systems	This chapter summarises the methods and main findings of a study of the environmental impacts of providing HE courses by campus-based and distance/open learning methods.Methodology\udSurveys of 20 UK courses ‚Äì 13 campus-based, 7 print-based and on-line distance learning courses ‚Äì covering travel, paper and print consumption, computing, accommodation, and campus site impacts. Conversion of results into energy and CO2 emissions per student per 100 hours of degree study.FindingsPart-time HE courses reduce energy and CO2 emissions by 60% compared to full-time campus-based courses and distance learning courses involve nearly 90% less energy and 85% fewer CO2 emissions than the full-time campus courses. The lower impacts of part-time and distance compared to full-time campus courses is mainly due to a reduction in student travel and elimination of much energy consumption of students‚Äô housing, plus economies in campus site utilisation,. E-learning appears to offer only small energy and emissions reductions compared to mainly print-based distance learning courses, mainly because e-learning requires more energy for computing and paper for printing.Research limitationsAssumptions were made in order to calculate the energy and emissions arising from the different HE systems. E.g. it was decided to include all the energy consumed in term-time accommodation for full-time campus students while part-time campus and distance learning students live at home only requiring additional heating and lighting for study. Future studies could include more distance and blended learning courses offered by institutions other than the UK Open University and impacts other than CO2 emissions.Practical implicationsExisting HE sustainability programmes should be broadened beyond considering campus site impacts and ‚Äògreening the curriculum‚Äô. Indeed, were HE expansion to take environmental impacts seriously, then part-time and distance education should be favoured over increasing full-time provision	['SDG11', 'SDG12', 'SDG13', 'SDG04', 'SDG07']
82903944	Osmium isotope evidence for the regulation of atmospheric CO2 by continental weathering	The long-term stability of Earth's climate throughout the Phanerozoic stands in marked contrast to the dramatic fluctuations that have taken place on time scales as short as a few years, reflecting the high efficiency of longer-term climate regulation through negative feedbacks. A fundamental mechanism is thought to involve control of CO2 in the ocean- atmosphere system through continental weathering, although unambiguous, high-resolution data supporting this hypothesis have hitherto not been available. Organic-rich mud rocks from Yorkshire, England, which were deposited during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (ca. 181 Ma, Early Jurassic), contain evidence of an exceptionally large excursion in the 187Os/188Os ratio of contemporaneous seawater, from 0.4 to 1.0. The most likely explanation for this excursion is that it resulted from a transient increase in global continental weathering rates of 400%‚Äì800%. The Os isotope excursion coincided with a well-documented global 13C excursion of ‚Äì6 that affected all the major biospheric reservoirs of the time. Higher mean global temperatures caused global chemical weathering rates to increase substantially, while, in turn, chemical weathering was very effective in reducing the elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 and the high temperatures to preexcursion levels	['SDG11', 'SDG13']
83955545	Circular Economy Research in the Built Environment: A Theoretical Contribution	Circular economy is quickly gaining momentum across numerous research fields. The founding principles of circular economies lie in a different perspective on, and management of, resources under the idea that an ever-growing economic development and profitability can happen without an ever-growing pressure on the environment. As such, the built environment has a lot to contribute, being the sector with the greatest environmental impacts. However, the few existing cases of current research in the built environment from a circular economy perspective seem to have just replaced the 3R principle (reduce, reuse, recycle) with the new ‚Äòbuzz-word‚Äô. In this paper, we argue that a significantly different research approach is necessary if the circular economy is to keep up to its promise of being a new paradigm for sustainability. We therefore propose a framework to formulate building research from within a circular economy perspective. The framework is built around six pillars and acknowledges the key role of interdisciplinary research and that of both bottom-up and top-down initiatives to facilitate the transition to ‚Äòcircular‚Äô buildings. Although theoretical in nature, the framework has been tested against current discourse about buildings and circular economies and it has proven a valuable tool to cluster existing initiatives and highlight missing interdisciplinary links. As such it can provide a valuable starting point to contribute to the theoretical foundations of building research from within the new paradigm of circular economies and also shape future research directions	['SDG11', 'SDG12', 'SDG09', 'SDG17']

82922156	Consumer behaviour towards sustainability in fashion	The consumption of fashion has grown in recent years as prices of clothing have fallen leading to ‚Äúcheap chic‚Äù, clothes that are worn a few times then discarded.  This has led to various ethical and environmental concerns within the framework of sustainability. One response to these issues was Considerate Design which integrated these concerns into the design process. An exploratory study was conducted to examine consumer attitudes towards sustainability within the context of fashion including the Considerate Design concept. It was revealed that whilst consumers were concerned about the environment, there was a very low awareness of environmental issues and attitudes did not translate into action with very few buying ethical/green fashion. It was also apparent that consumers were inconsistent, acting differently to what their stated attitudes were. There was inconsistency in the behaviour of many participants, that whilst they wished to behave in a certain manner, circumstances forced them to behave otherwise. Emotionally, buying and wearing clothes was a very complex issue for people with certain items being much-loved, either as items cherished for many years or as recent impulse buys. Self-image was a primary concern for some. For others the opinions of their peer group influenced what clothes they wore. When shopping for clothes many factors were important to participants with sustainability the last on the list. It is evident that when designing for sustainability, the emotional needs and wants of customers must be taken into consideration	['SDG11', 'SDG12']
