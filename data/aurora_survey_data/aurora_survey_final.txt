10.18814/epiiugs/2017/v40i1/017010	Geology and the Sustainable Development Goals	This paper presents an overview and visualisation of the role of geology in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These internationally-agreed goals aim to eradicate global poverty, end unsustainable consumption patterns, and facilitate sustained and inclusive growth, social development, and environmental protection. Through a matrix visualisation, this paper presents a synthesis that relates the 17 agreed SDGs to 11 key aspects of geology. Aspects considered are agrogeology, climate change, energy, engineering geology, geohazards, geoheritage and geotourism, hydrogeology and contaminant geology, mineral and rock resources, geoeducation, geological capacity building, and a miscellaneous category. The matrix demonstrates that geologists have a role in achieving all 17 of the SDGs. Three topics relating to improved engagement by geologists with international development are then highlighted for discussion. These are the development of supporting skills in education, improving transnational research collaborations, and ensuring respectful capacity building initiatives. This synthesis can help mobilise the broader geology community to engage in the SDGs, allowing those working on specific aspects of geology to consider their work in the context of sustainable development. The contribution that geologists can make to sustainable development is also demonstrated to other relevant disciplines, and development policy and practitioner communities	['SDG01']
10.15446/cuad.econ.v36n72.65871	A tale of two decades: Income inequality and public policy in Argentina (1996-2014)	This article analyses the evolution of income inequality in Argentina through the decomposition of the Gini coefficient by income sources. The dynamic analysis allows for simultaneous changes in participation and concentration of different income sources to be understood. The time periods that are the object of the analysis contrast diverse macroeconomic contexts, labour market institutions and social protection policies that were implemented. The results indicate that labour income is the main driver of distributive dynamics while retirement income has also played an important role. We also find that the evolution of income distribution in Argentina is closely related to labour market institutions and macroeconomics.Este artículo examina la evolución de la desigualdad del ingreso Argentina, por medio de la descomposición del coeficiente de Gini por fuentes de ingreso. El análisis dinámico permite la comprensión de los cambios simultáneos en la participación y concentración de las fuentes de ingresos. El periodo de análisis contrasta contextos macroeconómicos diferentes, las instituciones del mercado de trabajo y las políticas de protección social implementadas. Los resultados indican que los ingresos laborales son el principal conductor de la dinámica distributiva y que, a su vez, los ingresos de las jubilaciones y pensiones también han tenido un papel importante. También observamos que la evolución de la distribución del ingreso en Argentina se ve afectada por la evolución de las instituciones y la macroeconomía del mercado laboral.Instituto de Investigaciones en Humanidades y Ciencias Sociale	['SDG01']

10.1108/ijse-04-2017-0171	Poverty and technical efficiency in presence of heterogeneity in household behaviours: Evidence from Bangladesh	PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between poverty and technical efficiency (TE) of paddy farmers in presence of their heterogeneous selling behaviours. This paper explains how such behavioural heterogeneity affects this relationship in south-western Bangladesh.Design/methodology/approachTranslog production frontier model was used to estimate TE since it fitted the data set better. On the other hand, poverty indices were constructed by using P-αmethod. Then, multinomial logit models examined the existence of heterogeneous selling behaviours. It revealed adequate evidences in favour of behavioural heterogeneity. Finally, the authors employed a series of two stage instrumental variable regression models to relate poverty and TE with and without considering the behavioural heterogeneity.FindingsThe study finds that around 18, 39 and 44 per cent of households exhibit autarkic, non-wholesaling and wholesaling behaviour, respectively. Market failure due to transaction cost and credit constraints leads to emergence of such heterogeneity. Across these heterogeneous behaviours, impact of improving TE on poverty status significantly differs. Without controlling behavioural heterogeneity, TE significantly improves the poverty status of the rural farm households. However, scenario is changed after controlling this heterogeneity. After behavioural segregations, TE improves poverty status only for wholesalers. In contrary to prior expectation, it worsens the poverty situation for both autarkic and non-wholesaling households. Simultaneous failure in both credit and product market for these households might be the plausible reason behind this heterodox finding. Credit market failure compels these households to borrow from local money lenders with costlier terms. This effort might improve their TE. But, product market failure makes their additional production due to improved TE unsold. Thus, repayment of credit directly reduces their consumption expenditure. Therefore, an effort to improve TE might increase prevalence and depth of poverty when market failure exists. Henceforth, the improvement of TE appears as an effective policy instrument only when households exhibit wholesaling behaviour.Originality/valueThe earlier studies show the relationship between TE and poverty status but did not account behavioural heterogeneity. The authors attempt to overcome this shortcoming and show how market failure induced behavioural heterogeneity affects the effectiveness of TE on improving poverty status of farm households.</jats:sec	['SDG01']

10.3390/nu10081008	The effects of alcohol and drugs of abuse on maternal nutritional profile during pregnancy	The consumption of alcohol and drugs of abuse among pregnant women has experienced a significant increase in the last decades. Suitable maternal nutritional status is crucial to maintain the optimal environment for fetal development but if consumption of alcohol or drugs of abuse disrupt the intake of nutrients, the potential teratogenic effects of these substances increase. Despite evidence of the importance of nutrition in addicted pregnant women, there is a lack of information on the effects of alcohol and drugs of abuse on maternal nutritional status; so, the focus of this review was to provide an overview on the nutritional status of addicted mothers and fetuses. Alcohol and drugs consumption can interfere with the absorption of nutrients, impairing the quality and quantity of proper nutrient and energy intake, resulting in malnutrition especially of micronutrients (vitamins, omega&ndash;3, folic acid, zinc, choline, iron, copper, selenium). When maternal nutritional status is compromised by alcohol and drugs of abuse the supply of essential nutrients are not available for the fetus; this can result in fetal abnormalities like Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). It is critical to find a strategy to reduce fetal physical and neurological impairment as a result of prenatal alcohol and drugs of abuse exposure combined with poor maternal nutrition. Prenatal nutrition interventions and target therapy are required that may reverse the development of such abnormalities	['SDG02']

10.1177/1049732310361465	Identifying cultural representations of families and the health team to improve the management of severe malnutrition in childhood	Severe childhood malnutrition is no longer a priority in Latin America, but mortality of hospitalized malnourished children continues to be high, especially in Bolivia. The objective of the present study was to identify cultural representations in mothers and in health personnel that might influence the relationship between the family and the provider’s health care services, thus affecting the treatment of malnourished children. We applied a flexible qualitative model of cases and controls (mothers or caregivers of both under- and well-nourished children), and in addition, health personnel. Results were analyzed following semiotics of statements. Mothers and health professionals based their cultural representations on different conceptions of health. The mothers’ mindset indicated that traditional Andean medicine and public health systems are complementary and not contradictory. Conversely, health personnel expressed a univocal vision, accepting only biomedicine. Furthermore, they also expressed a negative attitude toward mothers of severely malnourished children. Results should be considered to improve ongoing local health programs. </jats:p	['SDG02']

10.1017/s0954422410000065	Breast- v. formula-feeding: Impacts on the digestive tract and immediate and long-term health effects	The health benefits of breast-feeding have been recognised for a long time. In particular, breast-feeding is associated with lower incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and diarrhoea during the early period of life and with lower incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases, type 2 diabetes and obesity later in life. The higher nutritional and protective degree of human milk is related to its nutritional composition that changes over the lactation period and to the biological activities of specific components while lower growth rate of breast-fed infants may be attributed to their self-regulation of milk intake at a lower level than formula-fed infants. Many results now suggest that the developmental changes in intestinal and pancreatic function that occur postnatally are modulated by the diet. Indeed, formula-feeding induces intestinal hypertrophy and accelerates maturation of hydrolysis capacities; it increases intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, but does not induce evident differences in microbiota composition. Whether these changes would be beneficial for enhancing absorptive capacities and for educating the gut-associated immune system remains to be further studied. Moreover, it is evident that formula-feeding increases basal blood glucose and decreases plasma ketone body concentrations, while discrepancies on postprandial glycaemia, insulin and incretin responses in both human studies and experimental studies are inconclusive. Manipulating the composition of formula, by reducing protein content, adding prebiotics, growth factors or secretory IgA can modulate intestinal and pancreatic function development, and thereby may reduce the differential responses between breast-fed and formula-fed neonates. However, the developmental responses of the digestive tract to different feeding strategies must be elucidated in terms of sensitivity to developing diseases, taking into account the major role of the intestinal microbiota.</jats:p	['SDG02']

10.1177/1403494810382476	Construction and evaluation of a self-contained index for assessment of diet quality	Aims: To construct and validate a self-contained index for the evaluation of a health-promoting diet in adults. Methods: Participants (n = 103) were healthy volunteer adults aged 20 to 64 years. A food consumption questionnaire containing 55 questions was formulated and evaluated against seven-day food records. Key questions best reflecting the health-promoting diet, defined in nutrition recommendations, were identified by correlation and ROC analyses in comparison to calculated food and nutrient intakes from the food records. A shorter questionnaire was scored to compile an Index of Diet Quality (IDQ). Results: Based on ROC analyses 18 questions were sufficient to describe the health-promoting diet and comprised the index. IDQ had a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 71%. The IDQ score reflected dietary intake, shown as statistically significant correlations between higher IDQ scores and higher intakes of protein (r = 0.35), fibre (r = 0.42), calcium (r = 0.39), iron (r = 0.31), vitamin C (r = 0.31) and a higher ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (r = 0.23) and a lower intake of saturated fatty acids (r =—0.22) and saccharose (r =—0.25). Conclusions: IDQ reflects dietary intake of key foods and nutrients associated with health and depicts adherence to dietary recommendations. It is applicable in nutritional studies where diet in its entirety is of interest and also in large-scale studies, being fast in execution with analysis free of complex calculations. </jats:p	['SDG02']

10.1158/1940-6207.capr-10-0398	Helicobacter pylori prevalence and circulating micronutrient levels in a low-income United States population	Abstract                High prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the leading cause of gastric cancer, and low levels of micronutrients have been observed in many developing countries, and the question remains as to the whether an association between the 2 exists. The present study seeks to further our understanding of this potential connection in the Southern Community Cohort Study, representing a low-income population in the United States. Blood levels of antibodies to H. pylori proteins were assessed by multiplex serology for a sample of 310 African American and white participants, ages 40 to 79 years. Blood collected at baseline was also assayed for levels of carotenoids, tocopherols, retinol, and folate. Multivariate linear regression was used to calculate least-squares mean micronutrient levels within groups defined by H. pylori status. The mean serum levels of all micronutrients assayed were lower among H. pylori + individuals than H. pylori − individuals, significantly for β-carotene, folate, and retinol (decreases of 27.6%, 18.6%, and 9.7%, respectively). Individuals who were seropositive to the virulent CagA+ H. pylori strains had even lower mean levels of micronutrients, particularly β-carotene, folate, total carotenoids, and retinol (decreases of 38.9%, 19.1%, 17.0%, and 11.7%, respectively, compared with H. pylori − individuals). However, dietary micronutrient levels as derived from a food frequency questionnaire did not vary between groups defined by H. pylori status. These results provide support for the hypothesis that H. pylori infection impairs nutrient absorption and suggest a need for future studies to explore the role of H. pylori infection on nutrition and gastric cancer risk in this high-risk population.

Objective: We investigated the complex associations between fat mass and fat-free mass and Max(dur) in a population setting. Design: The Max(dur) of a graded exercise treadmill test and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were estimated in 2413 black and white men and women aged 38–50 y from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. Results: The mean Max(dur) was ≈7.5 s shorter per kilogram of fat mass in both men and women and independent of fat-free mass, height, race, television watching, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, lung function, and education. Fat mass modified the association of fat-free mass with the Max(dur) (2-way interaction P < 0.001), and the interaction was stronger in women than in men. In men in the lowest fat-mass quartile, the Max(dur) was 1.3 s longer per kilogram of fat-free mass and was 0.5 s shorter per kilogram of fat-free mass in the highest fat-mass quartile. In contrast, in women with the least fat mass, the Max(dur) was 2.7 s longer per kilogram of fat-free mass and was 2.8 s shorter per kilogram of fat-free mass in the highest fat-mass quartile. Conclusions: The Max(dur) was negatively related to fat mass. Fat-free mass in obese people contributed little to the treadmill performance potential as assessed by the Max(dur), although the contribution of fat-free mass was positive in thinner people	['SDG02']

A prospective study of 50 overweight (OW) adults (22 in the general educational group - G1; 28 in the high fiber nutrition group - G2) was performed. Both groups were offered dietary counseling and supervised exercise. Clinical, anthropometric, dietary and plasma biochemical tests were performed at baseline - time 0 (T0) and after 10 weeks - time 1 (T1). Both groups improved their dietary quality, but only G2 presented higher intake of fruit and vegetables (servings/day), higher plasma beta-carotene levels and a 24% reduction of MetS incidence. Additionally G2 showed greater reductions in body fat (4%), and waist circumference (7%), obesity class III (2%) and obesity class II (14%) rate. Lifestyle intervention, including a high dietary fiber intake, improved healthy eating index and decreased body fat composition and plasma lipid concentrations leading to MetS incidence reduction	['SDG02']

10.5433/1679-0359.2012v33n1p115	Mycorrhizal colonization, spore density and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Cerrado soil under no-till and conventional tillage systems	The quest for sustainability in agricultural production through conservation management practices such as no-tillage, has favored the biochemical processes of soil, such as soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs), which promote a significant increase in specific surface absorption of the root system of plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the root colonization, spore density and diversity of AMFs in rhizosphere of corn and soybean grown under no-tillage with different cover crops and compared an area conventional tillage and fallow, in Uberaba, state of Minas Gerais. The corn and soybeans were rotated with millet, crotalaria and brachiaria. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with split plots. The experiment was established in 2000, and in 2007 assessed the colonization (COL) and spore density (ESP) (0.0-0.05m and 0.05-0.10m). In the layer of 0.0-0.10m evaluated the diversity of AMFs. It was found that there was a strong effect of culture on COL and ESP. However, the effect of the covers and management was seen only in 0.0-0.05m. The roots of corn has a higher percentages of COL and ESP compared with soybeans, for the coverage Brachiaria and millet. The mycorrhizal colonization of soybean and maize in Cerrado area was up 80% for soybeans and up 95% for corn. Conventional tillage soil the lowest number of AMFs species in relation to the coverage of millet and Brachiaria in no-till corn and soybeans. The principal components analysis  with some chemical, physical and biological factors of soil shows the separation of the areas assessed, and the biological component (COL and ESP) in the efficient separation of the areas under cultivation,  for the conditions of this study. A busca da sustentabilidade na produção agrícola através de manejos conservacionistas, como o sistema plantio direto, tem favorecido os processos bioquímicos do solo como dos fungos micorrízicos arbusculares (FMAs), os quais promovem um aumento expressivo da superfície específica de absorção do sistema radicular das plantas. Sendo assim, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a colonização micorrízica, densidade de esporos e a diversidade de FMAs na rizosfera de milho e soja cultivados sob plantio direto com diferentes plantas de cobertura e comparadas a uma área de preparo convencional e pousio, em Uberaba, MG. As culturas de milho e soja foram rotacionadas com milheto, crotalária e braquiária. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos casualizados, com parcelas subdivididas. O experimento foi implantado em 2000 e, em 2007 avaliou-se a colonização radicular por FMAs (COL) e densidade de esporos no solo (ESP) nas profundidades de 0,0-0,05 m e 0,05-0,10 m, já a avaliação da diversidade de FMAs foi na profundidade de 0,0-0,10 m. Verificou-se que houve efeito significativo das culturas sobre COL e ESP. Entretanto, o efeito das coberturas e do manejo foi verificado apenas em 0,0-0,05 m. As raízes de milho apresentam maiores porcentagens de COL e ESP quando comparado com a soja, para as coberturas de braquiária e milheto. A colonização micorrízica da soja e do milho na área de Cerrados foi  acima de 80% para soja e 95% para o milho. O sistema de preparo convencional do solo apresentou o menor número de espécies de FMAs em relação às coberturas de milheto e braquiária, em sistema plantio direto com milho e soja.

10.1177/1403494812443605	Urbanisation and the nutrition transition: A comparison of diet and weight status of South African and Kenyan women	Aims: To determine and compare the extent of the nutrition transition between Kenyan and South African women. Methods: A nationally representative sample of women aged ≥15 years ( n=1008) was assessed in Kenya. Weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences were measured. A 24-hour dietary recall was conducted with each participant. This data was compared with data of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of women in South Africa ( n=4481). Dietary intake of South African women was based on secondary data analysis of dietary studies using the 24-hour recall method ( n=1726). Results: In South Africa, 27.4% women had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 compared with 14.2% of Kenyan women. In both countries there were large urban–rural differences in BMI, with the highest prevalence in women in urban areas. BMI increased with age, as did abdominal obesity which was equally prolific in both countries with more than 45% of women in the older groups having a waist/hip ratio ≥0.85. The nutrient mean adequacy ratio (MAR) of the South African rural diet was lower than those of the Kenyans diet (55.9; 57.3%, respectively). Dietary diversity score (DDS) and food variety score (FVS) were significantly lower in South African rural women (3.3; 4.9) compared with Kenyans (4.5; 6.8). Conclusions: Urban–rural differences in diet and weight status indicates that the nutrition transition was similar in both countries despite large sociodemographic differences; however, rural Kenyan women had a better MAR, DDS, and FVS than South African women, most probably due to 60% having access to land. </jats:p	['SDG02']

This is the usually called 'Barker's hypothesis'. Increasing evidence suggests that conditions like vascular disease, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are programmed during the early stages of fetal development and become manifest in late stages of life, when there is an added impact of lifestyle and other conventional acquired environmental risk factors that interact with genetic factors. The aim of this review was to provide additional, updated evidence to support the association between intrauterine fetal health and increased prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases in adulthood. Various potential cellular and molecular mechanisms proposed to be related to the above hypothesis are discussed, including endothelial function, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial function. © 2011 SEEN	['SDG02']

10.1128/aem.01536-12	Changes in bowel microbiota induced by feeding weanlings resistant starch stimulate transcriptomic and physiological responses	ABSTRACT                        The ability to predictably engineer the composition of bowel microbial communities (microbiota) using dietary components is important because of the reported associations of altered microbiota composition with medical conditions. In a synecological study, weanling conventional Sprague-Dawley rats (21 days old) were fed a basal diet (BD) or a diet supplemented with resistant starch (RS) at 5%, 2.5%, or 1.25% for 28 days. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes and temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (TTGE) profiles in the colonic digesta showed that rats fed RS had altered microbiota compositions due to blooms of             Bacteroidetes             and             Actinobacteria             . The altered microbiota was associated with changes in colonic short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, colonic-tissue gene expression (             Gsta2             and             Ela1             ), and host physiology (serum metabolite profiles and colonic goblet cell numbers). Comparisons between germ-free and conventional rats showed that transcriptional and serum metabolite differences were mediated by the microbiota and were not the direct result of diet composition.

10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.09.002	Sit down at the ball game: How trade barriers make the world less food secure	This paper analyses the impacts of trade policy responses to rising world food prices by carrying out a series of stylised experiments in the wheat market using a world trade model, GTAP. The sequence of events that is modelled comprises a negative wheat supply shock and subsequent implementation of an export tax by a major net exporter and a reduction in import tariffs by a small importer. The effects of trade policy responses are contrasted with those of full liberalisation of the wheat market. At the core are the (opposite) effects on producers and consumers, as well as the terms of-trade and trade tax revenue effects. Food security is shown to depend crucially on changes in prices but also in incomes that are associated with changes in factor returns. The results reveal that major net exporters are generally better off when implementing export taxes for food security purposes. Large exporting countries export price instability causing world food prices to rise further. Net importing countries lose out and have limited leeway to reduce tariffs or subsidise imports. Liberalising wheat trade mitigates rising prices and contributes to food security, but to the detriment of production in Africa and Asia, making them more dependent on and vulnerable to changes in the world market. Concerted action at the WTO forum is required, notably clarifying and sharpening the rules regarding export measures	['SDG02']

10.1007/s13193-011-0082-6	Early Detection of Breast, Cervical, Ovarian and Endometrial Cancers in Low Resource Countries: An Integrated Approach	The incidence of breast and gynecological cancers continues to increase in low and middle resource countries [LRC'S and MRC's] with a disproportionately higher mortality rate compared to that in high resource countries. This has been attributed to factors such as an increased life span due to better control of communicable diseases and improved nutrition, as well as lifestyle and reproductive changes. A lack of public awareness and understanding of these cancers, absence of an organized screening program and a lack of accessible and effective treatment options, is responsible for the higher mortality rate. A practical approach of a combined program of integrating a well woman examination with screening for breast and cervical cancer and diagnostic evaluation for Ovarian and Endometrial cancer in symptomatic women is proposed in this article which can serve as a model to be studied for efficacy in low resource countries	['SDG02']
10.1155/2012/913960	Experiences in developing and implementing health clubs to reduce hypertension risk among adults in a south african population in transition	Chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are increasing substantially as a cause of death and disability in all strata of the South African society, particularly among the urbanised poor. Hypertension is a risk factor for many of these diseases and becoming a burden in a growing population in a Cape Town township, Khayelitsha. To alleviate healthcare demands at clinics in this area, a health club was initiated and community health workers (CHWs) were trained to empower community members about NCDs and create public awareness. After training, a health club was initiated. Three months after initiation of the health club, 76 participants had been recruited of whom 22 were regular attenders. New members joined the health club weekly. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken, and various hypertension topics were covered at the club meetings which included healthy behaviours, such as the benefits of being physically active and eating healthy. Nutrition education sessions based on the South African food-based dietary guidelines were also held. Consequent to the initial group that was established, two more clubs were formed in the area. Health clubs are sustainable and culturally appropriate when facilitated by local people who have an insight and deeper understanding of the culture and environment of the people they serve.</jats:p	['SDG02']

10.1002/hipo.22151	Iron deficiency with or without anemia impairs prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex	Iron deficiency (ID) during early life causes long-lasting detrimental cognitive sequelae, many of which are linked to alterations in hippocampus function, dopamine synthesis, and the modulation of dopaminergic circuitry by the hippocampus. These same features have been implicated in the origins of schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder with significant cognitive impairments. Deficits in sensorimotor gating represent a reliable endophenotype of schizophrenia that can be measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex. Using two rodent model systems, we investigated the influence of early-life ID on PPI in adulthood. To isolate the role of hippocampal iron in PPI, our mouse model utilized a timed (embryonic day 18.5), hippocampus-specific knockout of Slc11a2, a gene coding an important regulator of cellular iron uptake, the divalent metal transport type 1 protein (DMT-1). Our second model used a classic rat dietary-based global ID during gestation, a condition that closely mimics human gestational ID anemia (IDA). Both models exhibited impaired PPI in adulthood. Furthermore, our DMT-1 knockout model displayed reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and elevated paired pulse facilitation (PPF), electrophysiological results consistent with previous findings in the IDA rat model. These results, in combination with previous findings demonstrating impaired hippocampus functioning and altered dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, suggest that iron availability within the hippocampus is critical for the neurodevelopmental processes underlying sensorimotor gating. Ultimately, evidence of reduced PPI in both of our models may offer insights into the roles of fetal ID and the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia	['SDG02']

10.1111/cobi.12184	From population viability analysis to coviability of farmland biodiversity and agriculture	Substantial declines in farmland biodiversity have been reported in Europe for several decades. Agricultural changes have been identified as a main driver of these declines. Although different agrienvironmental schemes have been implemented, their positive effect on biodiversity is relatively unknown. This raises the question as to how to reconcile farming production and biodiversity conservation to operationalize a sustainable and multifunctional agriculture. We devised a bioeconomic model and conducted an analysis based on coviability of farmland biodiversity and agriculture. The coviability approach extended population viability analyses by including bioeconomic risk. Our model coupled stochastic dynamics of both biodiversity and farming land-uses selected at the microlevel with public policies at the macrolevel on the basis of financial incentives (taxes or subsidies) for land uses. The coviability approach made it possible for us to evaluate bioeconomic risks of these public incentives through the probability of satisfying a mix of biodiversity and economic constraints over time. We calibrated the model and applied it to a community of 34 common birds in metropolitan France at the small agricultural regions scale. We identified different public policies and scenarios with tolerable (0-0%) agroecological risk and modeled their outcomes up to 2050. Budgetary, economic, and ecological (based on Farmland Bird Index) constraints were essential to understanding the set of viable public policies. Our results suggest that some combinations of taxes on cereals and subsidies on grasslands could be relevant to develop a multifunctional agriculture. Moreover, the flexibility and multicriteria viewpoint underlying the coviability approach may help in the implementation of adaptive management.Se han reportado disminuciones sustanciales en la biodiversidad de las tierras de cultivo en Europa durante varias décadas. Los cambios agrícolas han sido identificados como los principales conductores de estas disminuciones. Aunque se han implementado diferentes esquemas agro-ambientales, su efecto positivo sobre la biodiversidad es prácticamente desconocido. Esto genera la pregunta de cómo reconciliar la producción agrícola y la conservación de la biodiversidad para operar una agricultura sostenible y multifuncional. Diseñamos un modelo bioeconómico y realizamos un análisis basado en la co-viabilidad de la biodiversidad de las tierras de cultivo y la agricultura. El acercamiento a la co-viabilidad extendió los análisis de viabilidad de población al incluir riesgos bioeconómicos. Nuestro modelo acopló dinámicas estocásticas tanto de la biodiversidad y el uso de suelo de la agricultura en un micro-nivel, como de las políticas públicas en un macro-nivel con base en los incentivos financieros (impuestos o subsidios) para el uso de suelo. La aproximación de co-viabilidad nos permitió evaluar los riesgos bioeconómicos de estos incentivos públicos a través de la probabilidad de una mezcla satisfactoria de biodiversidad y restricciones económicas a lo largo del tiempo. Calibramos el modelo y lo aplicamos a una comunidad de 34 especies de aves comunes en la Francia metropolitana con la escala de regiones agricultoras pequeñas. Identificamos diferentes políticas públicas y escenarios con riesgo agroecológico tolerable (0-0%) y modelamos sus resultados hasta el año 2050. Las restricciones presupuestales, económicas y ecológicas (basado en Farmland Bird Index) fueron esenciales para entender el conjunto de políticas públicas viables. Nuestros resultados sugieren que algunas combinaciones de impuestos sobre cereales y subsidios sobre pastizales podrían ser relevantes para desarrollar una agricultura multifuncional. Además, la flexibilidad y el punto de visto de criterios múltiples subyacentes al acercamiento de co-viabilidad puede ayudar en la implementación de un manejo adaptativo	['SDG02']

10.1071/an13091	Effect of vitamin D<inf>3</inf> and strontium on performance, nutrient retention, and bone mineral composition in broiler chickens	The therapeutic use of vitamin D3 and strontium has been successful for the treatment of osteoporosis in humans; however, the value of similar strategies in poultry is not clear. Male Ross broiler chicks (n = 216) were used in a 28-day broiler trial to assess effects of vitamin D3 and strontium supplementation on performance, nutrient retention, bone composition, and bone mass. Treatments included an industry-standard control diet and five additional diets where vitamin D3 was added at 5000, 20 000, or 35 000 IU/kg and strontium was added at 0 or 1200 mg/kg in a 3 × 2 factorial design. Broiler chickens supplemented with strontium and additional vitamin D3 did not increase bodyweight; however, there was a significant improvement in feed efficiency at medium levels of vitamin D3, and although not statistically significant, there was also an improvement in feed conversion ratio with strontium supplementation at normal vitamin D3 concentrations. Strontium supplementation at normal levels of vitamin D3 significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and magnesium retention. A high concentration of vitamin D3 produced a significant improvement in apparent metabolisable energy, protein, and dry matter utilisation in the broiler chicken. Paradoxically, however, there was a detrimental effect of high vitamin D3 on bodyweight and feed efficiency, which was partially ameliorated by strontium supplementation. Strontium addition did not change bone mass but did change bone composition. High levels of vitamin D3 significantly (P &lt; 0.01) reduced bone ash content and increased strontium content of bone. In conclusion, both vitamin D3 and strontium have the potential to positively influence the performance, mineral retention, and bone characteristics of broiler chicks. However, as with calcium and phosphorus, vitamin D3 and strontium interact and so more research is required with strontium on the optimum dose rate and its relationship with vitamin D3, calcium, phosphorus, and IGF-1 in broiler nutrition. </jats:p	['SDG02']

10.4274/tod.42650	The comparison of knowledge level and awareness of osteoporosis between women and men	Objective: Osteoporosis is a disease which causes fractures depending on decreasing bone mineral density. Nutrition and life style which  support the bone health must be known for prevention of the disease. This study was conducted to assess awareness about OP between  men and women.  Materials and Methods: The study was performed between the dates November 2012-May 2014 in Denizli Pamukkale University. A form  including sociodemographic features, Osteoporosis Knowledge Test (OKT) and Osteoporosis Health Belief Scale (OHBS) were used in the  collection of the data for evaluation the osteoporosis knowledge level and awarenes of the volunteers who accept to attend the study.  Results: Hundred forty-seven volunteers of 96 women and 51 men attended to the study. Mean age was 36.1±14,6 years and 6.1% of the  participants had a diagnosis osteoporosis and 13.6% of the participants had a family history of osteoporosis. When the participants were  compared according to gender, there were statistically significant difference between two groups for education level, had own and a family  history of osteoporosis (p<0,05). Men had higher education level than the women group. Women have higher own and familiy history of  osteoporosis. When the scores of the questionnaires were compared between women and men, the mean score of the Osteoporosis Health  Belief Scale- Susceptibility score was 16.8±5.0 and 13.7±4.0, respectively. The women’s score were higher than men (p<0.05). Significant  difference wasn’t found in the other subscales.  Conclusion: Despite the high educational level of the men, it was detected that the level of the osteoporosis susceptibility was lower than  women. High Osteoporosis Health Belief Scale level of women shows that women think osteoporosis is serious illness. Since the basic  treatment approach was the prevention for osteoporosis, the education programs must be organized for either women who have high risk,  or also for men to improve the awareness.

10.1017/s0260210514000187	Human rights and collective emancipation: The politics of food sovereignty	AbstractThis article develops contextually grounded accounts of emancipation in general and notions of collective rights based emancipation in particular by identifying a form of emancipatory politics in which collectives demand rights for themselves. The article develops the idea of collective, rights based emancipation by focusing on the practices of two related social movements, the Landless Workers Movement (MST) and la Via Campesina. The MST and Via Campesina seek to replace existing rights to ‘food security’ with a human right to ‘food sovereignty’. While food security agendas emphasise the role of international governance agencies in providing food on behalf of others, food sovereignty is secured by peasant social movements themselves. Furthermore, practices of active citizenship and democratic organisational structures, built through the grassroots and transnational struggles through which peasants raise their demand for human rights, are vital in enacting rights to food sovereignty. In instances where victims are not entirely silenced and powerless, this combination of a demand for human rights and the development of practices of citizenship that enable people to demand and secure rights for themselves provides a contextually grounded emancipatory alternative to interventionist politics that, however well intentioned, risk reinforcing the dependence of purportedly powerless victims.</jats:p	['SDG02']

The manipulation of the animals followed theguidelines of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation, under the approval ofthe animal ethics committee of the State University of Ponta Grossa. The palatal platescovered the whole palate, were fixed in the molar region with light-cured resin, andwere kept there for 14 days. The animals received a paste diet and water ad libitum.Before and after the trial period, the rats were weighed individually on a precisionscale. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way analysis of variance (α =0.05) test for comparison of the animals’ weight (g) at time 0 and after 14 days ofusing the palatal plate.Results: No statistical differences were observed regarding the weight of the animalsamong the experimental groups in the study.Conclusions: The individual master impressions, the molar teeth coverage, and themethod of cementation with nonadhesive composite resin provided good stability forthe palatal plate showed in this study, not disturbing the eating habits and nutritionof the animals. This model seems reproducible, offering adequate histopathologicalevaluation.

10.1007/978-94-017-8578-5_1	An introductory perspective to horticulture: Plants for people and places	Horticulture is “the first of all the arts and sciences”. This definition indicates both the breadth and depth of the discipline and its early inception as mankind changed from being hunter-gatherers to cultivators. Intensive crop production which is a form of horticulture preceded more extensive agricultural practices. From that time onwards the intricate involvement of horticulture in man’s life has become very apparent by its multitude of applications and the interests of those involved. These extend from the provision of foodstuffs and nutritional benefits through pharmaceuticals to aspects of rest and relaxation onto encouraging physical and mental well-being. Horticulture is therefore, a discipline with many components and as such that it can mean different things in the varying context of its use. This chapter introduces the meanings of horticulture as expressed by the authors who have contributed to this Trilogy of Books. They have analysed in considerable depth “Horticulture” as expressed in its facets of production, environment and society. Horticulture has impact and expression in each of these fields of human activity. This chapter also sets Horticulture into the wider context of the world of plants and their intensive cultivation both in their use by mankind and in the natural world. The aim is to demonstrate the depth and breadth of human activity associated with this discipline for it stretches from crop production, through landscape design and maintenance and into aspects of society and its expression in the arts and humanities. Horticulture touches almost every aspect of human activity. Increasingly Horticulture has significant importance in contributing towards the mitigation of the major problems which now face life on Earth such as:- climate change, food security, the loss of natural biodiversity, pollution, resource erosion and over-population. Indeed despite or perhaps because of its antiquity and therefore its strong connection between science, technology and practice horticulture can offer solutions that might allude other disciplines	['SDG02']

10.1017/s174217051600003x	Ecosystem services and tradeoffs in the home food gardens of African American, Chinese-origin and Mexican-origin households in Chicago, IL	AbstractWith increasing urbanization and environmental degradation, urban landscapes are increasingly expected to provide a wide range of ecosystem services typically associated with rural areas, including biodiversity conservation and food production. Because residential landscapes constitute the largest single urban land use, domestic gardens have emerged as a topic of research interest and planning concern. The ecosystem services (or disservices) these landscapes provide, however, have not been rigorously measured, nor have tradeoffs between the services they provide been assessed. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 59 African American, Chinese-origin or Mexican-origin households with on-lot or vacant lot food gardens in Chicago. Crop plants and cultivated ornamental plants on the lot were inventoried and mapped at the species level. A total of 123 edible plant taxa from 25 families and 288 ornamental plant species from 85 families were identified, for a combined total of 387 species from 90 families. Cumulatively, the gardens of African American households were relatively rich in ornamental plant species and families, while those of Chinese-origin households had a depauperate flora. Crop plant richness was more even across sample types. Shade trees and a developed shrub layer were absent from most gardens, possibly representing a tradeoff in ecosystem services in favor of food production. The richness of the aggregate 2.1 ha of residential property inventoried in this study was comparable with or exceeded that of a 34 ha prairie remnant west of Chicago. However, only 35 (9.6%) of the inventoried species were native to the Chicago area.</jats:p	['SDG02']

Os tratamentos foram compostos por duas formas físicas da ração (farelada e peletizada) e duas granulometrias do milho (3,8mm e 7,0mm). O delineamento experimental foi inteiramente ao acaso, em arranjo fatorial 2 x 2 (duas granulometrias x duas formas físicas), com seis repetições de 39 aves cada para os machos e seis repetições de 42 aves cada para as fêmeas. A ração peletizada produzida com moagem 3,8mm apresentou melhor PDI (P≤0,05). Aves fêmeas alimentadas com ração peletizada apresentaram maior consumo de ração, ganho de peso e melhor conversão alimentar que aquelas que receberam ração farelada. Não foi observada diferença significativa (P>0,05) entre os tratamentos para as variáveis ganho de peso, conversão alimentar e consumo de ração dos machos.

10.1111/cwe.12158	To Board or Not to Board: Evidence from Nutrition, Health and Education Outcomes of Students in Rural China	The debate over whether boarding school is beneficial for students still exists in both developing and developed countries. In rural China, as a result of a national school merger program that began in 2001, the number of boarding students has increased dramatically. Little research has been done, however, to measure how boarding status may be correlated with nutrition, health and educational outcomes. In this paper, we compare the outcomes of boarding to those of non-boarding students using a large, aggregate dataset that includes 59 rural counties across five provinces in China. We find that for all outcomes boarding students perform worse than non-boarding students. Despite these differences, the absolute levels of all outcomes are low for both boarding and non-boarding students, indicating a need for new policies that will target all rural students regardless of their boarding status.National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473239]; Chinese   Ministry of Education; State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs   [B16031]SSCIARTICLEshxiwangaiq@163.com; amedina5@stanford.edu; luorf.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn;   shiyaojiang7@gmail.com; yueai@163.com3,SI52-662	['SDG02']

We used primary data collected from 163 households in an off-grid Rwandan village to provide insights into energy poverty at the household-level. Informed by the rural livelihoods literature, we constructed a novel asset- and income-based index to disaggregate our results by socio-economic status. We also employed microeconometric techniques to investigate the determinants of household willingness-to-pay for electricity. We found statistically significant differences between households of different socio-economic status for expenditure on lighting and other electricity services, willingness-to-pay for electricity, income-generating activities and food security. Overall, our findings suggest that initiatives aiming to end energy poverty and catalyze rural development should: (1) recognize the different potential impacts of policies on households of different socio-economic status; (2) be sensitive to energy stacking behavior; (3) take a holistic approach to rural development; (4) and ensure that households are able to access modern energy through flexible payment schemes and equitable and sustained improvements in income.Link_to_subscribed_fulltex	['SDG02']

10.1080/10408398.2015.1045969	A Review on the Effect of Drying on Antioxidant Potential of Fruits and Vegetables	The role of antioxidants in human nutrition has gained increased interest, especially due to their associated health beneficial effects for a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. Fruits and vegetables are perishable and difficult to preserve as fresh products. Dried fruits and vegetables can be easily stored, transported at relatively low cost, have reduced packing costs, and their low water content delays microbial spoilage. Air-, freeze-, microwave- and sun-drying are among the most thoroughly studied drying methods. This review provides an overview of recent findings on the effects of different drying techniques on major antioxidants of fruits and vegetables. In particular, changes in ascorbic acid, carotenoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, total phenolics and antioxidant activity are discussed in detail	['SDG02']

10.1371/journal.pone.0162529	Agroforestry practices promote biodiversity and natural resource diversity in atlantic Nicaragua	Tropical forest conversion to pasture, which drives greenhouse gas emissions, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, remains a pressing socio-ecological challenge. This problem has spurred increased interest in the potential of small-scale agroforestry systems to couple sustainable agriculture with biodiversity conservation, particularly in rapidly developing areas of the tropics. In addition to providing natural resources (i.e. food, medicine, lumber), agroforestry systems have the potential to maintain higher levels of biodiversity and greater biomass than lower diversity crop or pasture systems. Greater plant diversity may also enhance soil quality, further supporting agricultural productivity in nutrient-limited tropical systems. Yet, the nature of these relationships remains equivocal. To better understand how different land use strategies impact ecosystem services, we characterized the relationships between plant diversity (including species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity), and soil quality within pasture, agroforests, and secondary forests, three common land use types maintained by small-scale farmers in the Pearl Lagoon Basin, Nicaragua. The area is undergoing accelerated globalization following the 2007 completion of the region's first major road; a change which is expected to increase forest conversion for agriculture. However, farmer agrobiodiversity maintenance in the Basin was previously found to be positively correlated with affiliation to local agricultural NGOs through the maintenance of agroforestry systems, despite these farmers residing in the communities closest to the new road, highlighting the potential for maintaining diverse agroforestry agricultural strategies despite heightened globalization pressures. We found that agroforestry sites tended to have higher surface soil %C, %N, and pH relative to neighboring to secondary forest, while maintaining comparable plant diversity. In contrast, pasture reduced species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and natural resource diversity. No significant relationships were found between plant diversity and the soil properties assessed; however higher species richness and phylodiversity was positively correlated with natural resource diversity. These finding suggest that small, diversified agroforestry systems may be a viable strategy for promoting both social and ecological functions in eastern Nicaragua and other rapidly developing areas of the tropics	['SDG02']
10.1002/bimj.201500201	The impact of stratification by implausible energy reporting status on estimates of diet-health relationships	© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is known to be prone to measurement error. Researchers have suggested excluding implausible energy reporters (IERs) of FFQ total energy when examining the relationship between a health outcome and FFQ-reported intake to obtain less biased estimates of the effect of the error-prone measure of exposure; however, the statistical properties of stratifying by IER status have not been studied. Under certain assumptions, including nondifferential error, we show that when stratifying by IER status, the attenuation of the estimated relative risk in the stratified models will be either greater or less in both strata (implausible and plausible reporters) than for the nonstratified model, contrary to the common belief that the attenuation will be less among plausible reporters and greater among IERs. Whether there is more or less attenuation depends on the pairwise correlations between true exposure, observed exposure, and the stratification variable. Thus exclusion of IERs is inadvisable but stratification by IER status can sometimes help. We also address the case of differential error. Examples from the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study and simulations illustrate these results	['SDG02']

10.1017/s0029665117000313	The importance of dietary DHA and ARA in early life: a public health perspective	Although the literature on the contribution of DHA and arachidonic acid (ARA) to fundamental metabolic functions in brain, immune and cardiovascular systems is extensive, there is a lack of consensus on the need for explicit recommendations on dietary intake for both DHA and ARA during the early years of life. This review takes a public health perspective with the objective of ensuring that recommendations protect the most vulnerable children worldwide. Most studies on the effects of DHA and ARA in early life have been undertaken in high-income countries and this is reflected in policy recommendations. Although breast milk is considered the gold standard and always contains DHA and ARA, there are proposals that infant formulas, especially follow-on formulas, do not need to be supplemented with these fatty acids. Complementary foods frequently have low concentrations of ARA and DHA and this is most significant in low-income countries where availability is also limited. Recent evidence shows that in developing countries, intakes of DHA and ARA during the age period 6–36 months are low and this relates to low national income. It is concluded that a continuum of DHA and ARA intake needs to be maintained during early life, a critical period of infant growth and development. For both infant and follow-on formulas, DHA and ARA should be mandatory at levels that are equivalent to breast milk. An optional recommendation may be limited to countries that can demonstrate evidence of adequate intakes of DHA and ARA during early life.</jats:p	['SDG02']

10.1016/j.lcsi.2017.11.002	Social learning through rural communities of practice: Empirical evidence from farming households in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta	The social-ecological systems of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) are under stress driven by accelerating impacts of climate change, upstream hydropower development, and local flood management policies. These combined complexities have prompted the rural societies to make significant efforts to adapt to changing conditions. While local adaptation represents diverse patterns of communication and interactions across the social sectors, far less attention has been given to how these learning processes occur in the rural communities of practice. This paper attempts to delineate the learning dynamics in which farming households are key practitioners. The mixed methods approach that guides data collection includes focus group discussions, indepth interviews with key informants and household surveys. The analysis suggests that social learning plays a significant role in facilitating the adoption and dissemination of experiential and experimental knowledge across geographical boundaries. This study highlights important aspects of households' social learning system characterized by informal networks with various forms of bonding and bridging relationships. These learning patterns suggest that informal communication is a dominant learning approach in the rural delta. This study contributes to advancing the theoretical and empirical knowledge of social learning and its policy implications for rural development in the VMD	['SDG02']

10.6133/apjcn.042017.02	Critical examination of evidence for the nutritional status of children in Papua New Guinea - a systematic review	Background and Objectives: Undernutrition remains a significant cause of childhood illness, poor growth, development, and death in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Studies on child nutritional outcomes in PNG vary by design, measurement protocols and quality. We conducted a systematic review to assess the evidence for the prevalence of child undernutrition across different study populations, geographical locations and time periods. Methods and Study Design: Six electronic databases and additional grey literature were searched for articles describing the nutritional status by wasting, stunting and underweight, of PNG children under five years of age, published between 1990 and April 2015. Prevalence data using different scales of measurement and reference populations were standardized according to WHO protocols. Results: The search yielded 566 articles, of which, 31 studies met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of child undernutrition varied from 1% to 76% for wasting (median 11%), 5% to 92% for stunting (median 51%), and 14% to 59% for underweight (median 32%). Wide variations exist according to the index used for measurement, the population characteristics and the geographical region in which they live. Prevalence estimates increase significantly when data using different scales of measurement and population references are standardized to the WHO protocols. Conclusions: Child undernutrition in PNG is regionally variable due to a complex interplay of poverty, disease, food-security, cultural, environmental and sociopolitical issues requiring a complex mix of solutions by governments, health systems and local communities. Area- specific surveys using multiple measures are necessary to inform local solutions for this important problem	['SDG02']

Objective The study aimed to find out 25years trend of nutritional status among rural adults of six states in India, pooled estimate for India and predict the estimate for future 20years. Design The body mass index (BMI) data of both men and women of six states and India for the year 1992–2011 was collected from the publicly available reports of National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) and for 2014–15 was taken from National Family and Health Survey –IV (NFHS-IV). The data for monthly per capita expenditure was extracted from national sample survey (NSS) reports. The 25-year historical BMI prevalence data between 1991–92 and 2014 were tested for linear, quadratic and cubic trends. The analysis was done using STATA. Settings Data for six states of India and pooled estimate of India was collected and analyzed. Main findings All states show a decline trend in underweight and increase trend in overweight/obesity. The pooled estimates for India reports though the trend of underweight is declining in both men and women still it is above 20% and after 20years the prevalence will be 10%. The trend test for overweight/obesity was found to be significant at P value Conclusion The regional variances in prevalence of the nutrition among rural Indians and suggests state specific nutritional policy should be developed for double burden of nutrition	['SDG02']

10.1093/ajcn/nqy060	Effects of intraduodenal administration of the artificial sweetener sucralose on blood pressure and superior mesenteric artery blood flow in healthy older subjects	First published online June 6, 2018Background:Postprandial hypotension (PPH) occurs frequently, particularly in older people and those with type 2 diabetes, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The magnitude of the decrease in blood pressure (BP) induced by carbohydrate, fat, and protein appears to be comparable and results from the interaction of macronutrients with the small intestine, including an observed stimulation of mesenteric blood flow. It is not known whether artificial sweeteners, such as sucralose, which are widely used, affect BP. Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of intraduodenal sucralose on BP and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow, compared with intraduodenal glucose and saline (control), in healthy older subjects. Design:Twelve healthy subjects (6 men, 6 women; aged 66-79 y) were studied on 3 separate occasions in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. After an overnight fast, subjects had concurrent measurements of BP and heart rate (HR; automated device), SMA blood flow (Doppler ultrasound), and blood glucose (glucometer) during intraduodenal infusion of 1) glucose (25% wt:vol, ∼1400 mOsmol/L), 2) sucralose (4 mmol/L, ∼300 mOsmol/L), or 3) saline (0.9% wt:vol, ∼300 mOsmol/L) at a rate of 3 mL/min for 60 min followed by intraduodenal saline for a further 60 min. Results:There was a decrease in mean arterial BP (P < 0.001) during intraduodenal glucose [baseline (mean ± SEM): 91.7 ± 2.6 mm Hg compared with t = 60 min: 85.9 ± 2.8 mm Hg] but not during intraduodenal saline or intraduodenal sucralose. The HR (P < 0.0001) and SMA blood flow (P < 0.0001) also increased during intraduodenal glucose but not during intraduodenal saline or intraduodenal sucralose. As expected, blood glucose concentrations increased in response to glucose (P < 0.0001) but not saline or sucralose. Conclusions:In healthy older subjects, intraduodenal administration of the artificial sweetener sucralose was not associated with changes in BP or SMA blood flow. Further studies are therefore warranted to determine the potential role for artificial sweeteners as a therapy for PPH.

When considering the impact of a plant pathogen, the financial costs incurred by an outbreak usually receive the most focus, but there are other much less understood consequences for the affected society, culture, and environment due to disease. This poorly studied layer of complexity is particularly relevant for emerging outbreaks, of which often only limited knowledge is available to devise management strategies, but decisions and actions must be made quickly. The recent outbreak of a bacterial plant pathogen in Europe illustrates how understanding not only the biology of an emerging pathogen but also the cultural context is critical for effectively communicating and engaging with stakeholders and policy makers in order to implement successful disease control strategies	['SDG02']

Genetic, environmental, behavioral and dietary factors influence the pathways that regulate aging and life expectancy, thus rendering longevity a very complex phenomenon. Although a long-lived elixir has not yet been found, physicians and scientists agree that nutrition has a major impact on the overall mortality and morbidity, hence becoming the subject of a widespread scientific research. This review describes, analyzes and compares the effects of different types of diets in reducing the onset of typical Western countries non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (cardiovascular diseases, tumors, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, etc.), thus increasing the average lifespan. It will first depict the most relevant characteristics, nutraceutical properties and effects on the populations of the Mediterranean, Japanese, Vegetarian and New Nordic Diet. Finally, it will describe the impact of different dietary restrictions in modulating the genetic pathways that regulate metabolism and aging. Overall, this work reinforces the evidence that specific eating habits, in addition to healthy and active lifestyles, are crucial to increase people’s health span and to achieve an optimal longevity.</jats:p	['SDG02']

The 5 x 2 factorial structure under a randomized block design, with the factors: concentration of dairy wastewater (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) and two types of substrates Bioplant® and a mixture of soil, sand and manure, at a ratio 2:1:1, with four replications of eight plants per plot. After 60 days, the following characteristics were evaluated: length of shoot and root (cm), number of leaves, stem diameter (mm), dry matter of the aerial part and root system (g) and analysis of macro and micronutrient present. The highest development of papaya seedlings occurred with the application of dairy-production wastewater at a concentration of 100% when used with substrate constituted by soil, sand and manure, meeting hydric and nutritional demand in the initial phase of papaya seedlings.O Estado de Minas Gerais é um grande gerador de resíduos provenientes da fabricação de derivados do leite, onde o reaproveitamento da água residuária desse processo além de servir como fonte de nutrientes, pode evitar poluição de água e do solo. O objetivo do trabalho foi o reaproveitamento da água residuária de laticínio para a formação de mudas de mamoeiro, considerando suas necessidades hídricas no período de formação de mudas. Foi utilizado o esquema fatorial 5 x 2, em delineamento em blocos casualizados, sendo os fatores: concentrações de água residuária de laticínio (0, 25, 50, 75 e 100%) e dois tipos de substratos, Bioplant® e uma mistura de terra, areia e esterco bovino, na proporção 2:1:1, com quatro blocos e oito plantas por parcela. Após 60 dias, foram avaliadas as seguintes características: comprimento da parte aérea e do sistema radicular (cm), número de folhas, diâmetro do caule (mm), matéria seca da parte aérea e do sistema radicular (g) e análise de macro e micronutrientes presentes nas plantas. O maior desenvolvimento das mudas de mamoeiro ocorreu com a aplicação da água residuária de laticínio na concentração de 100% quando utilizada com o substrato composto por solo, areia e esterco bovino, suprindo as necessidades hídricas e nutricionais na formação das mudas de mamoeiro	['SDG02']

10.5588/ijtld.14.0813	Clearing the smoke around the TB-HIV syndemic: Smoking as a critical issue for TB and HIV treatment and care	The collision of the tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics has been described as a ‘syndemic’ due to the synergistic impact on the burden of both diseases. This paper explains the urgent need for practitioners and policy makers to address a third epidemic that exacerbates TB, HIV and TB-HIV. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Smoking is more prevalent among persons diagnosed with TB or HIV. Smoking is associated with tuberculous infection, TB disease and poorer anti-tuberculosis treatment outcomes. It is also associated with an increased risk of smoking-related diseases among people living with HIV, and smoking may also inhibit the effectiveness of life-saving ART. In this paper, we propose integrating into TB and HIV programmes evidence-based strategies from the ‘MPO-WER’ package recommended by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Specific actions that can be readily incorporated into current practice are recommended to improve TB and HIV outcomes and care, and reduce the unnecessary burden of death and disease due to smoking	['SDG03']

10.22328/2077-9828-2018-10-1-37-46	Antiretrovirus therapy - A new epoch of prevention of HIV infection	Modern medicine, relying on a verified strategy and consistent approach, has proved that to date, HIV infection, thanks to effective antiretroviral therapy, has evolved from a category of  incurable and deadly diseases into a nosology potentially controlled  by medical and diagnostic measures. Moreover, as shown by  numerous studies, not only clinical, but also the population effect has been achieved. The life expectancy of HIV-infected people  has increased, its quality has significantly improved, and the number of potential sources of infection has decreased. The concept of  «treatment as prevention» at the present stage becomes an integral  part of the complex of measures to combat HIV infection, since the  early onset of ART can significantly reduce the risk of transmission of the pathogen, as well as the level of AIDS-associated morbidity and  mortality. In addition to ART, the principles of comprehensive prevention remain unshakable, taking into account the modern epidemiological features of HIV infection.Современная медицина, опираясь на выверенную стратегию и последовательный подход, доказала, что на сегодняшний день ВИЧ-инфекция благодаря эффективной антиретровирусной терапии превратилась из разряда неизлечимых и смертельных болезней  в нозологию, потенциально управляемую лечебно-диагностическими мероприятиями. При  этом, как показывают многочисленные исследования, достигнут не только клинический, но  и популяционный эффект. Увеличилась продолжительность жизни ВИЧ-инфицированных,  существенно улучшилось ее качество, а также снизилось число потенциальных источников  инфекции. Концепция «лечение как профилактика» на современном этапе становится неотъемлемой частью комплекса мер по борьбе с ВИЧ-инфекцией, поскольку  раннее начало антиретровирусной терапии позволяет существенно снизить риск передачи  возбудителя, а также уровень СПИД-ассоциированной заболеваемости и смертности  населения. При этом, наряду с антиретровирусной терапией, незыблемыми остаются  принципы комплексной профилактики, учитывающие современные эпидемиологические  особенности ВИЧ-инфекции.</p	['SDG03']

Here, Zika virus (ZIKV) seroprevalence was estimated among participants of a pediatric cohort, a separate household cohort, and an adult-only subset from the household cohort, in Managua, Nicaragua, after the 2016 Zika epidemic, yielding 36, 46, and 56% seropositivity, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the only ZIKV seroprevalence study reported in Central America and the largest in the Americas and in a pediatric population to date. The explosive 2016 Zika epidemic resulted in a high level of seropositivity to ZIKV, making a second large Zika epidemic in Managua in the near future unlikely.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1086/650449	Influenza vaccination among healthcare workers: Ten-year experience of a large healthcare organization	OBJECTIVE. To describe the results of different measures implemented to improve adherence to the healthcare worker (HCW) influenza immunization program at BJC HealthCare during the period from 1997 through 2007.DESIGN. Descriptive retrospective study.SETTING. BJC HealthCare, a 13-hospital nonprofit healthcare organization in the Midwest.METHODS. We reviewed and analyzed HCW influenza vaccination data from all BJC HealthCare Occupational Health Services and hospitals during the period from 1997 through 2007. Occupational health staff, infection prevention personnel, and key influenza vaccination campaign leaders were also interviewed regarding implementation measures during the study years.RESULTS. At the end of 2007, BJC HealthCare had approximately 26,000 employees. With the use of multiple progressive interventions, influenza vaccination rates among BJC employees increased from 45% in 1997 to 72% in 2007 (P < .001). The influenza vaccination rate in 2007 was significantly higher than in 2006: 72%, compared with 54% (P < .001). Five hospitals had influenza vaccination rates that exceeded the target goal of 80% in 2007. The most successful interventions were adding influenza vaccination rates to the quality scorecard incentive program and the use of declination statements, both of which were implemented in 2007. The most important barriers to success identified by interview respondents were HCWs' misconceptions about influenza vaccination and a perceived lack of leadership support.CONCLUSIONS. Influenza vaccination rates among HCWs significantly improved with multiple interventions over the years. However, the BJC HealthCare influenza vaccination target of 80% was not attained at all hospitals with these measures. More aggressive interventions, such as implementing mandatory influenza vaccination policies, are needed to achieve higher vaccination rates.

10.2217/whe.10.8	Maternal mortality in developing countries: Challenges in scaling-up priority interventions	Although maternal mortality is a significant global health issue, achievements in mortality decline to date have been inadequate. A review of the interventions targeted at maternal mortality reduction demonstrates that most developing countries face tremendous challenges in the implementation of these interventions, including the availability of unreliable data and the shortage in human and financial resources, as well as limited political commitment. Examples from developing countries, such as Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Honduras, demonstrate that maternal mortality will decline when appropriate strategies are in place. Such achievable strategies need to include redoubled commitments on the part of local, national and global political bodies, concrete investments in high-yield and cost-effective interventions and the delegation of some clinical tasks from higher-level healthcare providers to mid-or lower-level healthcare providers, as well as improved health-management information systems. </jats:p	['SDG03']

Studies that focus on the chemical composition of the material are frequent in the literature, but those that characterize the biological fraction are rare. The objectives of this study were to characterize samples collected in Sao Paulo, Brazil on the quantity of fungi and endotoxins associated with PM2.5, correlating with the mass of particulate matter, chemical composition and meteorological parameters. We did that by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regressions. The results have shown that fungi and endotoxins represent significant portion of PM2.5, reaching average concentrations of 772.23 spores mu g(-1) of PM2.5 (SD: 400.37) and 5.52 EU mg(-1) of PM2.5 (SD: 4.51 EU mg(-1)), respectively. Hyaline basidiospores, Cladosporium and total spore counts were correlated to factor Ba/Ca/Fe/Zn/K/Si of PM2.5 (p < 0.05). Genera Pen/Asp were correlated to the total mass of PM2.5 (p < 0.05) and colorless ascospores were correlated to humidity (p < 0.05). Endotoxin was positively correlated with the atmospheric temperature (p < 0.05). This study has shown that bioaerosol is present in considerable amounts in PM2.5 in the atmosphere of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Some fungi were correlated with soil particle resuspension and mass of particulate matter. Therefore, the relative contribution of bioaerosol in PM2.5 should be considered in future studies aimed at evaluating the clinical impact of exposure to air pollution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldOBJECTIVE: To examine whether depressed mood and anger mediate the effects of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence on self-injurious behavior and substance use. METHODS: A cross-sectional national survey was conducted including 9,085 16-19 year old students attending all high schools in Iceland in 2004. Participants reported frequency of sexual abuse, family conflict/violence, self-injurious behavior, substance use, depressed mood, and anger. RESULTS: Sexual abuse and family conflict/violence had direct effects on self-injurious behavior and substance use among both genders, when controlling for age, family structure, parental education, anger, and depressed mood. More importantly, the indirect effects of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence on self-injurious behavior among both males and females were twice as strong through depressed mood as through anger, while the indirect effects of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence on substance use were only significant through anger. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in cases of sexual abuse and family conflict/violence, substance use is similar to externalizing behavior, where anger seems to be a key mediating variable, opposed to internalizing behavior such as self-injurious behavior, where depressed mood is a more critical mediator. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Practical implications highlight the importance of focusing on a range of emotions, including depressed mood and anger, when working with stressed adolescents in prevention and treatment programs for self-injurious behavior and substance use	['SDG03']

DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Patients with first-time MI in 2009 from the Central Denmark Region. Data were obtained from patient questionnaires and from registers. RESULTS: Of the 1288 eligible patients, 908 (70.5%) responded. The mean (SD) age was 67.1 (11.7) years and 626 (68.9%) were men. Overall, 287 (31.6%) of the patients lived alone and 398 (45.4%) had less than 10 years of education. Upwards of half (58.5%) of the patients stated that they had participated in hospital-based rehabilitation shortly after admission. A total of 262 (29.2%) were identified with anxiety or depressive disorder or both, according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Of these, 78 (29.8%) reported that they had participated in psychosocial support, and 55 (21.0%) used antidepressants. One in five patients smoked three months after MI although nearly half of the smokers had stopped after the MI. Regarding cardioprotective drugs, 714 (78.6%) used aspirin, 694 (76.4%) clopidogrel, 756 (83.3%) statins, and 735 (81.0%) beta-blockers. CONCLUSION: After three months, there is a considerable potential for further rehabilitation of MI patients. In particular, the long-term CR should focus on mental health, smoking cessation, and cardioprotective drugs	['SDG03']

10.1186/1471-2229-12-28	Identification of wounding and topping responsive small RNAs in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)	Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are two major classes of small RNAs. They play important regulatory roles in plants and animals by regulating transcription, stability and/or translation of target genes in a sequence-complementary dependent manner. Over 4,000 miRNAs and several classes of siRNAs have been identified in plants, but in tobacco only computational prediction has been performed and no tobacco-specific miRNA has been experimentally identified. Wounding is believed to induce defensive response in tobacco, but the mechanism responsible for this response is yet to be uncovered. Results To get insight into the role of small RNAs in damage-induced responses, we sequenced and analysed small RNA populations in roots and leaves from wounding or topping treated tobacco plants. In addition to confirmation of expression of 27 known miRNA families, we identified 59 novel tobacco-specific miRNA members of 38 families and a large number of loci generating phased 21- or 24-nt small RNAs (including ta-siRNAs). A number of miRNAs and phased small RNAs were found to be responsive to wounding or topping treatment. Targets of small RNAs were further surveyed by degradome sequencing. Conclusions The expression changes of miRNAs and phased small RNAs responsive to wounding or topping and identification of defense related targets for these small RNAs suggest that the inducible defense response in tobacco might be controlled by pathways involving small RNAs.</p	['SDG03']

10.1371/journal.pone.0039819	Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 subtypes in India: Origin and evolutionary history of the predominant subtype C	India has the third largest HIV-1 epidemic with 2.4 million infected individuals. Molecular epidemiological analysis has identified the predominance of HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C). However, the previous reports have been limited by sample size, and uneven geographical distribution. The introduction of HIV-1C in India remains uncertain due to this lack of structured studies. To fill the gap, we characterised the distribution pattern of HIV-1 subtypes in India based on data collection from nationwide clinical cohorts between 2007 and 2011. We also reconstructed the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the predominant HIV-1C strains.gene analysis was considered to provide the most reliable estimate [1971, (95% CI: 1965–1976)]. The population growth pattern revealed an initial slow growth phase in the mid-1970s, an exponential phase through the 1980s, and a stationary phase since the early 1990s.The Indian HIV-1C epidemic originated around 40 years ago from a single or few genetically related African lineages, and since then largely evolved independently. The effective population size in the country has been broadly stable since the 1990s. The evolving viral epidemic, as indicated by the increase of recombinant strains, warrants a need for continued molecular surveillance to guide efficient disease intervention strategies	['SDG03']

10.2217/fvl.12.91	Seroprevalence of HBV and HCV among HIV-infected adults in China according to route of HIV infection: High rate of HBV and HCV exposure	Coinfection of viral hepatitis, specifically HBV and HCV, has been increasingly observed among patients infected with HIV. However, the prevalence of coinfection is not well characterized in China. Prior studies have reported prevalence rates among individual populations that have varied significantly by mode of HIV transmission and by location. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional survey of three HIV-infected populations classified according to the route of HIV transmission, specifically, former plasma donors (FPDs), commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men, and intravenous drug users (IVDUs), and measured rates of HBV and HCV coinfection. Results: From June 2007 through December 2008, 624 FPDs, 512 IVDUs and 460 subjects infected with HIV through sexual transmission were enrolled into the study. We observed a prevalence of chronic HBV infection of 20% among IVDUs, 19% among those infected sexually and 3% among FPDs. The prevalence of an isolated positive test for hepatitis B core antibody was 27% among those infected sexually, 12% among IVDUs and 4% among FPDs. We observed the highest prevalence of HCV antibody seropositivity among IVDUs (94%), compared with 75% among FPDs and 27% among those infected sexually. Conclusion: Among three representing groups of HIV-infected patients in China, we observed a high prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfection with HIV. In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic coinfection, additional policies are needed for prevention and treatment. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1080/09540253.2012.712097	College aspirations and expectations among new African-American mothers in late adolescence	It is a generally accepted finding in the sociological literature as well as in public discourse that adolescent mothers are less likely than their non-parenting counterparts to graduate high school and to attend college. For several decades, however, researchers have pointed out that the implied causal process from teen motherhood to academic failure has been largely unsupported by empirical research. In fact, scholars have recently argued that motherhood may actually serve as a positive turning point in the lives of young women. Using a sample of young African American women, the present study assesses the degree to which teen motherhood not only affects college aspirations but also expectations. Further, it tests the ability of these effects to explain the well-known educational attainment gap between teen mothers and their non-childbearing peers. Results indicate that, in general, young mothers’ college aspirations are similar to those of non-mothers, but that their generally high aspirations for academic success appear to be effectively countered by their decreased educational expectations	['SDG03']

Methods The sample included 1467 women from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study who were 30–79 years old at baseline and had 3–22 health examinations between 1971 and 2006. CRF was quantified by maximal Balke treadmill exercise tests. The total metabolic equivalent-minutes/week of self-reported PA and measured BMI (kg/m2 ) were calculated. Results The overall pattern of CRF decreased over time. After age 60 years, fitness level tended to decline rapidly. Women at age 50 had the highest PA level, which decreased after age 50 and plateaued at age 60. The overall pattern of BMI increased with age. However, after age 60 years the rate of increase in BMI became much slower. Adjusting for smoking, health status, and the individual exposures of CRF, PA and BMI did not influence the observed associations. Women who did not meet current PA recommendation or those who were low fit at baseline had a higher BMI throughout adulthood than their more active or fit peers, but the trajectory of BMI was unassociated with baseline activity or fitness levels. Conclusion We concluded that the age-related longitudinal patterns in physical activity and fitness are not linear. Baseline activity and fitness levels are associated with BMI status during adulthood, but do not affect BMI change trajectory	['SDG03']
10.1097/qai.0b013e318279734d	Transmission of risk-group specific HIV-1 strains among Dutch drug users for more than 20 years and their replacement by nonspecific strains after switching to low-harm drug practices	To characterize HIV-1 epidemiological networks of men having sex with men (MSM) and drug users (DUs) in the Netherlands for >30 years. Previously, we demonstrated different origin of the HIV-1 epidemics in Dutch MSM and DUs. To achieve the study objectives, risk group-specific genetic markers in the pol gene were examined in 315 participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS who were registered as HIV-1 infected in 1981-2011. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated circulation of distinct virus strains in the 2 networks, with 98% of viruses of MSM clustering together and apart from strains of 73% DUs. Nine genetic markers that significantly distinguished virus strains specific for DUs were identified, of which 3 were ≥90% conserved. Over the total observation period, only 6% of viruses (4 of MSM and 14 of DUs) clustered with those of the other risk group. Among these sequences, the 3 most conserved genetic markers of that other risk group were 87% conserved.All 4 cases of DU-specific viruses among MSM occurred in 1980s-early 1990s. Viruses nonspecific for DUs were causing new infections among DUs at the rate of 20% till 2002 and replaced DU-specific strains among new infections thereafter, coinciding with switching of DUs to low-harm drug practices. Dutch MSM and DUs have remained separate epidemiological networks for decades, despite their geographical and behavioral overlap. Switching to low-harm drug practices among DUs resulted in new infections caused by HIV-1 strains originating from other risk group	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.midw.2011.12.009	Practices related to postpartum uterine involution in the Western Highlands of Guatemala	BACKGROUND: Guatemala has the third highest level of maternal mortality in Latin America. Postpartum haemorrhage is the main cause of maternal mortality. In rural Guatemala, most women rely on Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) during labour, delivery, and the postpartum period. Little is known about current postpartum practices that may contribute to uterine involution provided by Mam- and Spanish-speaking TBAs in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. METHODS: a qualitative study was conducted with 39 women who participated in five focus groups in the San Marcos Department of Guatemala. Questions regarding postpartum practices were discussed during four focus groups of TBAs and one group of auxiliary nurses. RESULTS: three postpartum practices believed to aid postpartum uterine involution were identified: use of the chuj (Mam) (Spanish, temazcal), a traditional wood-fired sauna-bath used by Mam-speaking women; herbal baths and teas; and administration of biomedicines. CONCLUSIONS: TBAs provide the majority of care to women during childbirth and the postpartum period and have developed a set of practices to prevent and treat postpartum haemorrhage. Integration of these practices may prove an effective method to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in the Western Highlands of Guatemala	['SDG03']
10.1186/1475-9276-12-16	An exploratory study of the policy process and early implementation of the free NHIS coverage for pregnant women in Ghana	Background\ud \ud Pregnant women were offered free access to health care through National Health Insurance (NHIS) membership in Ghana in 2008, in the latest phase of policy reforms to ensure universal access to maternal health care. During the same year, free membership was made available to all children (under-18). This article presents an exploratory qualitative analysis of how the policy of free maternal membership was developed and how it is being implemented. \ud \ud Methods\ud \ud The study was based on a review of existing literature – grey and published – and on a key informant interviews (n = 13) carried out in March-June 2012. The key informants included representatives of the key stakeholders in the health system and public administration, largely at national level but also including two districts. \ud \ud Results\ud \ud The introduction of the new policy for pregnant women was seen as primarily a political initiative, with limited stakeholder consultation. No costing was done prior to introduction, and no additional funds provided to the NHIS to support the policy after the first year. Guidelines had been issued but beyond collecting numbers of women registered, no additional monitoring and evaluation have yet been put in place to monitor its implementation. Awareness of the under-18 s policy amongst informants was so low that this component had to be removed from the final study. Initial barriers to access, such as pregnancy tests, were cited, but many appear to have been resolved now. Providers are concerned about the workload related to services and claims management but have benefited from increased financial resources. Users still face informal charges, and are reported to have responded differentially, with rises in antenatal care and in urban areas highlighted. Policy sustainability is linked to the survival of the NHIS as a whole. \ud \ud Conclusions\ud \ud Ghana has to be congratulated for its persistence in trying to address financial barriers. However, many themes from previous evaluations of exemptions policies in Ghana have recurred in this study – particularly, the difficulties of getting timely reimbursement to facilities, of controlling charging of patients, and of reaching the poorest. This suggests that providing free care through a national health insurance system has not solved systemic weaknesses. The wider concerns about raising the quality of care, and ensuring that all supply-side and demand-side elements are in place to make the policy effective will also take a longer term and bigger commitment	['SDG03']

10.1128/jvi.02370-12	Emergence in japan of an HIV-1 variant associated with transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) in china: First indication of the international dissemination of the chinese MSM Lineage	ABSTRACT                        A survey of HIV-1 strains circulating in the Tokyo-Kanagawa metropolitan area of Japan during 2004 to 2011 (             n             = 477) identified six Japanese males (patients 1 to 6), who harbored viruses with genome segments derived from a distinct CRF01_AE variant uniquely found among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China (designated CN.MSM.01-1). These six HIV infections were diagnosed in 2010 and 2011 among MSM (3 of 75) and men with unknown risk factors (3 of 63) and differed from the vast majority of HIV infections among MSM in Japan, which are overwhelmingly characterized by subtype B (239 of 246 [97.2%]). Approximately one-third (91 of 239 [38.1%]) of subtype B strains from MSM in Japan belong to a large monophyletic cluster (designated JP.MSM.B-1). In addition, we identified a smaller subtype B cluster (             n             = 8) (designated JP.MSM.B-2) that also contains strains from two Chinese MSM living in Japan. Interestingly, patients 5 and 6 were found to be coinfected with CRF01_AE (CN.MSM.01-1) and subtype B (JP.MSM.B-2 or JP.MSM.B-1) variants that are unique to the HIV-1 epidemics among MSM in China and Japan, respectively. Our study demonstrates for the first time the effect of the expanding HIV epidemic among MSM in China on transmission in neighboring countries and shows the ongoing mixing of CRF01_AE and subtype B lineages unique to HIV-1 that cocirculate in MSM populations in East Asia. This finding highlights the importance of strengthening epidemiological surveillance in the region and the need for effective measures to limit transmission among MSM in East Asia.           </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1017/s1755691013000054	Society and a low-carbon future: Individual behaviour change or new social values and priorities?	ABSTRACTAlthough Scottish and UK governments have ambitious targets for climate change mitigation, and there is increased understanding of the risks to future prosperity of fossil fuel energy dependence, limited practical progress has been made by the advanced economies in reducing carbon emissions, especially when embedded emissions in imported consumer goods are taken into account. Significant contributory factors are the social and cultural values, beliefs and practices, which result in risks of climate change being regarded as secondary to short-term pressures for economic growth and increased consumer spending. The result is that climate change and transition to a low-carbon society become ‘back of the mind’ issues. Current policy designed to lower carbon emissions from household consumption treats society as a series of individuals, each responding rationally to market incentives to maximise short-term personal gain. ‘Greener choices’ are incentivised and encouraged by social marketing, but, at best, this approach will achieve only very gradual change. An alternative model treats society as comprising historically evolving, dynamic social systems and cultures that are capable of dealing with transformational change, when there is a shared understanding of the reasons for acting. From this perspective, society can implement step changes in behaviour through collaborative action in the interests of the longer-term common good. Political momentum can be gathered for new legislative and/or taxation measures, as for example in the case of the strong programme for tobacco control legislation in Scotland and the UK. By focusing on social and technical infrastructures, the built environment, and the regeneration of local economies, rather than on individual behaviours, government investment can have far greater impact. A distinctively Scottish narrative for a low-carbon society can create momentum for transition through shared understanding of the risks of climate change, and its meanings for social life, cultures, economic relationships and values.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Se recomienda el uso de métodos cognitivo-conductuales (entrevista motivadora, intervenciones psicológicas), aplicados por profesionales sanitarios, con la participación de familiares de los pacientes, para contrarrestar el estrés psicosocial y reducir el RCV mediante dietas saludables, entrenamiento físico, abandono del tabaco y cumplimiento terapéutico. También se requieren medidas de salud pública, como la prohibición de fumar en lugares públicos o eliminar los ácidos grasos trans de la cadena alimentaria. Otras novedades consisten en desestimar el tratamiento antiagregante en prevención primaria y la recomendación de mantener la PA dentro del rango 130-139/80-85 mmHg en pacientes diabéticos o con RCV alto. Se destaca el bajo cumplimiento terapéutico observado, porque influye en el pronóstico de los pacientes y en los costes sanitarios.

Methods  A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was undertaken. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from 1990 to 2012. Search terms incorporating the concepts of cancer survivors, QOL and various types of CAM were used.    Results  From 1767 records retrieved and screened 13 full text articles were included in the review. Nine studies were deemed to have a high risk, one a low risk, and three an unclear risk of bias. CAM interventions used incorporated yoga, meditation or mindfulness, energy healing, medical qigong, homoeopathy, or mistletoe therapy. Ten of the studies used breast cancer survivors, whilst the remaining three included other cancer types. The studies had mixed results either showing a significantly greater improvement in QOL in the intervention group compared to the control group, or no significant difference between groups. However, twelve studies were of low to moderate quality, limiting the robustness of findings.    Conclusions  This review has identified significant gaps in the evidence base for the effectiveness of CAM on QOL in cancer survivors.    Further work in this field needs to adopt more rigorous methodology to help support cancer survivors to actively embrace self-management and effective CAMs, without recommending inappropriate interventions which are of no proven benefit	['SDG03']

10.1186/1471-2458-13-816	Qualitative evaluation of the Teenage Mothers Project in Uganda: A community-based empowerment intervention for unmarried teenage mothers	BACKGROUND: A large proportion of unmarried teenage mothers in Uganda face physical, psychological, and social problems after pregnancy and childbirth, such as obstetric complications, lack of education, and stigmatisation in their communities. The Teenage Mothers Project (TMP) in Eastern Uganda empowers unmarried teenage mothers to cope with the consequences of early pregnancy and motherhood. Since 2000, 1036 unmarried teenage mothers, their parents, and community leaders participated in economic and social empowerment interventions. The present study explored the changes resulting from the TMP as well as factors that either enabled or inhibited these changes. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (N = 23) were conducted with former teenage mothers , community leaders, and project implementers, and lifeline histories were obtained from former teenage mothers (N = 9). Quantitative monitoring data regarding demographic and social characteristics of teenage mother participants (N = 1036) were analysed. RESULTS: The findings suggest that, overall, the TMP seems to have contributed to the well-being of unmarried teenage mothers and to a supportive social environment. It appears that the project contributed to supportive community norms towards teenage mothers' position and future opportunities, increased agency, improved coping with early motherhood and stigma, continued education, and increased income generation by teenage mothers. The study findings also suggest limited change in disapproving community norms regarding out-of-wedlock sex and pregnancy, late active enrolment of teenage mothers in the project (i.e., ten months after delivery of the child), and differences in the extent to which parents provided support. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that strengths of the community-based TMP seem to be its socio-ecological approach, the participatory planning with community leaders and other stakeholders, counselling of parents and unmarried teenage mothers, and the emphasis on education and income generation. The project can improve by earlier active participation of unmarried pregnant adolescents and increased support for parents	['SDG03']
10.2217/whe.13.40	Improving access to emergency contraception under the Scottish Sexual Health Strategy: Can rates of unintended pregnancy be reduced?	Unintended pregnancy is a global sexual health problem. Outcomes of unintended pregnancy include unwanted childbirth and abortion, which may be associated with negative physical and psychosocial health implications for women. In Scotland, the Scottish Sexual Health Strategy has the stated goal of improving the sexual health of the people of Scotland. One aim of the Strategy is to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and one policy designed to achieve this is ‘widening access to emergency contraception’. This paper examines the success of this policy with reference to the implicit link it makes between expanding access to emergency contraception and increasing its effective use, aiming thereby to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy. Since there is evidence that previous policies and strategies expanding access to emergency contraception have failed to reduce such rates, alternative approaches to achieve a reduction in unintended pregnancies are discussed. </jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1158/1940-6207.capr-13-0081	Examining the association between oral health and oral HPV infection	Abstract                Oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the cause of 40% to 80% of oropharyngeal cancers; yet, no published study has examined the role of oral health in oral HPV infection, either independently or in conjunction with other risk factors. This study examined the relation between oral health and oral HPV infection and the interactive effects of oral health, smoking, and oral sex on oral HPV infection. Our analyses comprised 3,439 participants ages 30 to 69 years for whom data on oral HPV and oral health were available from the nationally representative 2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Results showed that higher unadjusted prevalence of oral HPV infection was associated with four measures of oral health, including self-rated oral health as poor-to-fair [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25–1.95], indicated the possibility of gum disease (PR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.13–2.01), reported use of mouthwash to treat dental problems in the past week (PR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07–1.52), and higher number of teeth lost (Ptrend = 0.035). In multivariable logistic regression models, oral HPV infection had a statistically significant association with self-rated overall oral health (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.15–2.09), independent of smoking and oral sex. In conclusion, poor oral health was an independent risk factor of oral HPV infection, irrespective of smoking and oral sex practices. Public health interventions may aim to promote oral hygiene and oral health as an additional measure to prevent HPV-related oral cancers. Cancer Prev Res; 6(9); 917–24. ©2013 AACR.</jats:p	['SDG03']
10.2105/ajph.2012.301174	Creating smoke-free places through the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities	In some high-, middle-, and low-income countries, law has been employed to limit individuals’ secondhand smoke exposure. Innovative legal tools are still needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries where smoking prevalence continues to rise.  For some persons with severe respiratory conditions, the presence of secondhand smoke is intolerable and prevents their entrance into restaurants and other venues. With its adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2006, the United Nations gave countries a new way to promote the rights of disabled individuals and simultaneously address secondhand smoke exposure.  We analyze the CRPD’s potential to advance tobacco control goals and offer recommendations for advocates, policymakers, and others seeking to apply this approach. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1007/s40258-013-0043-z	Generic medicines: Solutions for a sustainable drug market?	Generic medicines offer equally high-quality treatment as originator medicines do at much lower prices. As such, they represent a considerable opportunity for authorities to obtain substantial savings. At the moment, the pharmaceutical landscape is changing and many pharmaceutical companies have altered their development and commercial strategies, combining both originator and generic divisions. In spite of this, the generic medicines industry is currently facing a number of challenges: delayed market access; the limited price differential with originator medicines; the continuous downwards pressure on prices; and the negative perception regarding generic medicines held by some key stakeholder groups. This could jeopardize the long-term sustainability of the generic manufacturing industry. Therefore, governments must focus on demand-side policies, alongside policies to accelerate market access, as the generic medicines industry will only be able to deliver competitive and sustainable prices if they are ensured a high volume. In the future, the generic medicines industry will increasingly look to biosimilars and generic versions of orphan drugs to expand their business.status: publishe	['SDG03']

10.1080/08870446.2013.799161	Effects of and attention to graphic warning labels on cigarette packages	peer reviewedObjective: The present study investigates the effects of graphic cigarette warnings compared to text-only cigarette warnings on smokers’ explicit (i.e. ratings of the packages, cognitions about smoking, perceived health risk, quit intentions) and implicit attitudes. In addition, participants’ visual attention towards the graphic warnings was recorded using eye-tracking methodology. Design and methods: Sixty-three smokers participated in the present study and either viewed graphic cigarette warnings with aversive and non-aversive images or text-only warnings. Data were analysed using analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Results: Especially, graphic cigarette warnings with aversive content drew attention and elicited high threat. However, whereas attention directed to the textual information of the graphic warnings predicted smokers’ risk perceptions, attention directed to the images of the graphic warnings did not. Moreover, smokers’ in the graphic warning condition reported more positive cognitions about smoking, thus revealing cognitive dissonance. Conclusion: Smokers employ defensive psychological mechanisms when confronted with threatening warnings. Although aversive images attract attention, they do not promote health knowledge. Implications for graphic health warnings and the importance of taking their content (i.e. aversive vs. non-aversive images) into account are discussed	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.hrtlng.2013.09.007	The gender-specific association between asthma and the need to smoke tobacco	Objectives: To examine the associations between multidimensional tobacco dependence and youths\u27 asthma status with gender as an effect modifier. Background: Despite the adverse respiratory effects, some adolescents with asthma smoke tobacco. Girls and boys have been shown to have different motivations for tobacco use. Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted of data obtained from 1248 adolescents who completed the British Columbia Youth Survey of Smoking and Health II. The sample was limited to youth who reported current or experimental tobacco use and who provided asthma status information. Tobacco dependence was assessed with the modified-Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire and four-dimension Adolescents\u27 Need for Smoking Scale (ANSS), which assesses social dependence, physical dependence, emotional dependence, and sensory dependence on tobacco. All analyses were stratified by gender. Results: The sample was 535 boys and 713 girls who were 15.9 years of age (SD = 1.5), on average. Gender was associated with both self-reported asthma status and the physical dependence dimension of the ANSS. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that girls with asthma, compared with girls without asthma, had higher physical tobacco dependence scores, after adjusting for demographic and other factors. None of the tobacco dependence dimensions was associated with the asthma status of boys. Conclusions: Asthmatic girls who report smoking may be doing so because they develop physical dependence relatively quickly and lose their autonomy with respect to tobacco use. They may require significant support for smoking cessation, including cognitive behavioral therapy and nicotine replacement therapy	['SDG03']

A Psicologia, ao considerar a subjetividade e os princípios éticos relacionados aos direitos humanos, configura-se como agente fundamental na elaboração de políticas públicas efetivas no contexto da aids. Este estudo intenta levantar uma discussão sobre a inserção da Psicologia neste campo e o que pode ser feito no sentido de promover uma reflexão por parte dos(as) psicólogos(as) sobre suas práticas, viabilizando novos olhares e intervenções. Para tanto, foi realizada uma revisão teórica não-sistemática sobre a temática. A partir disso, concluiu-se que a Psicologia pode desempenhar relevante papel na elaboração e execução de políticas públicas em HIV/aids e atuar para além de uma prática assistencial, que colabore para a promoção dos direitos humanos e o exercício da cidadania.</jats:p	['SDG03']

To compare public and policy maker support for three point-of-sale tobacco policies. Design. Two cross-sectional surveys—one of the public from the New York Adult Tobacco Survey and one of policy makers from the Local Opinion Leader Survey; both collected and analyzed in 2011. Setting. Tobacco control programs focus on educating the public and policy makers about tobacco control policy solutions. Subjects. Six hundred seventy-six county-level legislators in New York's 62 counties and New York City's five boroughs (response rate: 59%); 7439 New York residents aged 18 or older. Landline response rates: 20.2% to 22%. Cell phone response rates: 9.2% to 11.1%. Measures. Gender, age, smoking status, presence of a child aged 18 years or younger in the household, county of residence, and policy maker and public support for three potential policy solutions to point-of-sale tobacco marketing. Analysis. t-tests to compare the demographic makeup for the two samples. Adjusted Wald tests to test for differences in policy support between samples. Results. The public was significantly more supportive of point-of-sale policy solutions than were policy makers: cap on retailers (48.0% vs. 19.2%, respectively); ban on sales at pharmacies (49.1% vs. 38.8%); and ban on retailers near schools (53.3% vs. 42.5%). Limitations: cross-sectional data, sociodemographic differences, and variations in item wording. Conclusions. Tobacco control programs need to include information about implementation, enforcement, and potential effects on multiple constituencies (including businesses) in their efforts to educate policy makers about point-of-sale policy solutions. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

10.5603/piap.2014.0014	Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on patient's life and his family	Introduction: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the most common chronic diseases of adults and is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world. It is the cause of physical and mental suffering for the patient, significantly impairs quality of life, reduces the vital activity and affects the patient’s life in its various aspects. In 2012, the nationwide survey was conducted in COPD outpatients with a history of smoking exploring the various factors of the disease and its effects on the health and life of the patient. The purpose of the analysis presented here is to assess the impact of COPD and tobacco smoking on the patient’s health and life. Material and Methods: Data were collected from patients by their physicians during routine visit with usage of specifically prepared questionnaire for this study. Patients over 35 years of age, with diagnosed COPD, current or past smokers were recruited from outpatients settings. The study involved 10,365 patients with COPD. Representative sample of 2967 questionnaires were randomly drawn for the statistical analysis. Results: The mean age of responders was 61.15 ± 10.25 years, 33.98% of participants were women, 56.73% were current smokers and 43.37% declared smoking in the past. The largest number of patients had COPD in a moderate degree (II—acc. to GOLD 2010)—55.38%, sequentially mild (I)—21.40%, and severe (III)—19.96%, the smallest group were people with very severe degree of disease (IV)—3.27%. Using the new classification of the COPD severity (acc. to GOLD 2013), the largest group of patients were less symptomatic (mMRC ) subjects who had a low risk (A)—52.67%, but in fact a second group of patients were subjects with severe symptoms and a high risk (D)—20.45% , sequentially—patients with low severity of symptoms, but a high risk (C)—16.16% , and severe symptoms and a low risk—10.72% (B). Patients most often reported that COPD affects their activity in sport (83.45% of respondents), than in living activity (82.78%) and family life (79.3%). COPD had significant (moderate or severe) effect on sport (60.85%) and life activity (38.44%), as well as on work (34.9%), but the greatest impact, leading up to the resignation of the activity: on sport practice (21.75%), sexual intercourse (12.6%) and hobbies (11.49%). The disease severity (GOLD 2013 C/D) was the independent factor which reduced all forms of activity. In patients’ opinion smoking had negative impact on their health (52,65%) and the family budget (41.83%). The negative impact of smoking on family relations was declared by 16.38% of respondents. Among the factors which favor effective quit from addiction were: age ≥ 65 years and more seere degree of obturation (III/IV GOLD 2010). Conclusions: The results of the study confirmed the significant impact of the disease and addiction to smoking not only on patients’ life but also on their families.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1093/aje/kwu115	Who is more affected by ozone pollution? A systematic review and meta-analysis	Ozone is associated with adverse health; however, less is known about vulnerable/sensitive populations, which we refer to as sensitive populations. We systematically reviewed epidemiologic evidence (1988–2013) regarding sensitivity to mortality or hospital admission from short-term ozone exposure. We performed meta-analysis for overall associations by age and sex; assessed publication bias; and qualitatively assessed sensitivity to socioeconomic indicators, race/ethnicity, and air conditioning. The search identified 2,091 unique papers, with 167 meeting inclusion criteria (73 on mortality and 96 on hospitalizations and emergency department visits, including 2 examining both mortality and hospitalizations). The strongest evidence for ozone sensitivity was for age. Per 10-parts per billion increase in daily 8-hour ozone concentration, mortality risk for younger persons, at 0.60% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40, 0.80), was statistically lower than that for older persons, at 1.27% (95% CI: 0.76, 1.78). Findings adjusted for publication bias were similar. Limited/suggestive evidence was found for higher associations among women; mortality risks were 0.39% (95% CI: −0.22, 1.00) higher than those for men. We identified strong evidence for higher associations with unemployment or lower occupational status and weak evidence of sensitivity for racial/ethnic minorities and persons with low education, in poverty, or without central air conditioning. Findings show that some populations, especially the elderly, are particularly sensitive to short-term ozone exposure	['SDG03']

The arrival of west nile virus (wnV) and its first associated human deaths ushered in a rereading of the mosquito from an itchy nuisance to a potentially life-threatening hazard. Mundane objects now required attention like never before. Swimming pools, irrigation canals, ditches, clogged gutters, and abandoned tires all became potential sources of a mobile public health hazard: the mosquito vector. In the state of Arizona, wnV went from a largely unanticipated epidemic situation to an endemic one in short order, where expectation of ongoing disease control quickly became a part of government obligations (Robbins et al. 2008)	['SDG03']
10.1186/1471-2393-14-268	Experiences of and responses to disrespectful maternity care and abuse during childbirth; a qualitative study with women and men in Morogoro Region, Tanzania	Background:  Interventions to reduce maternal mortality have focused on delivery in facilities, yet in many low-resource settings rates of facility-based birth have remained persistently low. In Tanzania, rates of facility delivery have remained static for more than 20 years. With an aim to advance research and inform policy changes, this paper builds on a growing body of work that explores dimensions of and responses to disrespectful maternity care and abuse during childbirth in facilities across Morogoro Region, Tanzania.    Methods:  This research drew on in-depth interviews with 112 respondents including women who delivered in the preceding 14 months, their male partners, public opinion leaders and community health workers to understand experiences with and responses to abuse during childbirth. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated and coded using Atlas.ti. Analysis drew on the principles of Grounded Theory.    Results:  When initially describing birth experiences, women portrayed encounters with providers in a neutral or satisfactory light. Upon probing, women recounted events or circumstances that are described as abusive in maternal health literature: feeling ignored or neglected; monetary demands or discriminatory treatment; verbal abuse; and in rare instances physical abuse. Findings were consistent across respondent groups and districts. As a response to abuse, women described acquiescence or non-confrontational strategies: resigning oneself to abuse, returning home, or bypassing certain facilities or providers. Male respondents described more assertive approaches: requesting better care, paying a bribe, lodging a complaint and in one case assaulting a provider.    Conclusions:  Many Tanzanian women included in this study experienced unfavorable conditions when delivering in facilities. Providers, women and their families must be made aware of women’s rights to respectful care. Recommendations for further research include investigations of the prevalence and dimensions of disrespectful care and abuse, on mechanisms for women and their families to effectively report and redress such events and on interventions that could mitigate neglect or isolation among delivering women. Respectful care is a critical component to improve maternal health	['SDG03']

The interaction of pregnancy and the RD is varied, ranging from spontaneous improvement to aggravation of disease symptoms or life-threatening flares. Risks for the mother with RD and the child differ in regard to the presence of organ manifestations, organ damage, disease activity, presence of specific autoantibodies, and therapy. Pregnancy complications comprise hypertension, preeclampsia, premature delivery, and side effects of therapy. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal demise, and they are frequently encountered in RD with organ manifestations and harmful autoantibodies. Because of the difference in the prevalence of RDs, knowledge on the gestational course of disease and pregnancy outcome is limited to the fairly common RDs such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Pregnancies in RD are connected with increased risks for mother and child and need interdisciplinary care and management	['SDG03']

10.1093/ntr/ntu231	Trends in E-Cigarette awareness, trial, and use under the different regulatory environments of Australia and the United Kingdom	INTRODUCTION: E-cigarettes (ECs) have gained significant attention in recent years. They have been introduced in jurisdictions with divergent existing laws that affect their legality. This provides the opportunity for natural experiments to assess effects of such laws in some cases independent of any formulated government policy. We compare patterns of EC awareness and use over a 3 year period in Australia where laws severely restrict EC availability, with awareness and use in the United Kingdom where ECs are readily available. METHODS: Data analyzed come from Waves 8 and 9 (collected in 2010 and 2013, respectively) of the International Tobacco Control surveys in Australia and the United Kingdom (approximately 1,500 respondents per wave per country). RESULTS: Across both waves, EC awareness, trial, and use among current and former smokers were significantly greater in the United Kingdom than in Australia, but all 3 of these measures increased significantly between 2010 and 2013 in both countries, and the rate of increase was equivalent between countries. Seventy-three percent of U.K. respondents reported that their current brands contained nicotine as did 43% in Australia even though sale, possession and/or use of nicotine-containing ECs without a permit are illegal in Australia. EC use was greater among smokers in both countries, at least in part due to less uptake by ex-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: EC awareness and use have risen rapidly between 2010 and 2013 among current and former smokers in both Australia and the United Kingdom despite different EC regulatory environments. Substantial numbers in both countries are using ECs that contain nicotine	['SDG03']

Smokeless tobacco users (N = 237) at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences were randomized to placebo or varenicline. Abstinence was defined as cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence cessation at end of treatment (EOT). General Linear Model repeated measures assessed the effects of treatment condition, time, abstinence state and interaction effects on changes in craving, withdrawal, positive (PA) and negative affect (NA) from baseline to EOT. All participants showed a significant reduction in withdrawal (p<.001), total craving (p<.001), positive reinforcement (PR) craving (p<.001), and NA (p=.02), and an increase in PA (p=.04) from baseline to EOT. However, there were no differences between placebo and varenicline participants in measures of withdrawal, craving, or affect from baseline to week 3 or at EOT. Significant interactions between time and abstinence state were found for total craving (p=.008), PR craving (p<.001), and withdrawal (p=.001), indicating reductions in these processes among those abstinent vs. those still chewing smokeless tobacco. Additional research is needed concerning the effects of varenicline on craving, withdrawal, and affect among smokeless tobacco users	['SDG03']

There is still uncertainty about health risks from arsenic at low-medium doses (<100 μg/L).A large population-based study using an administrative cohort of residents in the Viterbo province (Central Italy), chronically exposed to low-medium arsenic levels via drinking water, was investigated to evaluate the effects of a lifetime exposure to arsenic on mortality from cancers and chronic diseases.) was estimated through a space-time modeling approach using residential history and arsenic concentrations from water supply. A time-dependent Cumulative Arsenic dose Indicator (CAI) was calculated, accounting for daily water intake and exposure duration. Mortality Hazard Ratios (HR) were estimated by gender for different diseases using Cox proportional models, adjusting for individual and area-level confounders. A flexible non-parametric approach was used to investigate dose-response relationships. and CAI indicators with several diseases were found, with greatest risks found for lung cancer in both sexes (HR = 2.61 males; HR = 2.09 females), myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease and COPD in males (HR = 2.94; HR = 2.44; HR = 2.54 respectively) and diabetes in females (HR = 2.56). For lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases dose-response relationship is modelled by piecewise linear functions revealing effects even for doses lower than 10 μg/L, and no threshold dose value was identified as safe for health.Results provide new evidence for risk assessment of low-medium concentrations of arsenic and contribute to the ongoing debate about the threshold-dose of effect, suggesting that even concentrations below 10 μg/L carry a mortality risk. Policy actions are urgently needed in areas exposed to arsenic like in the Viterbo province, to comply with current EU regulations	['SDG03']

10.1111/ajo.12416	Trends in maternal and newborn health characteristics and obstetric interventions among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers in Western Australia from 1986 to 2009	Background  Detailed analyses of long-term trends in Aboriginal maternal and newborn health characteristics are lacking.  Aim  To examine trends in maternal and newborn health characteristics for all mothers who were recorded as Aboriginal in the Western Australian Midwives' Notification System from 1986 to 2009.  Materials and Methods  Births were categorised into four-year time intervals (1986–1989, 1990–1993, 1994–1997, 1998–2001, 2002–2005, 2006–2009). Trends in maternal demographic characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, pregnancy complications and neonatal characteristics were examined.  Results  For 37 424 births recorded from 1986 to 2009, the proportion of births to mothers aged ≤19 years decreased (31–22%, P < 0.001) along with the prevalence of pre-eclampsia (6.8–4.0%, P < 0.001) and antepartum haemorrhage (4.8–3.2%, P < 0.001). There were increases in the prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy (3.8–6.6%, P < 0.001), induction of labour (17.8–21.4%, P < 0.001), elective caesarean (6.6–8.2%, P < 0.001) and emergency caesarean (9.5–14.9%, P < 0.001) deliveries. There were no changes in the overall prevalence of preterm births (15.4–15.9%, P = 0.32). However, increases were observed in the prevalence of medically indicated preterm births with and without prelabour rupture of membranes (1.0–1.7%; P < 0.001 and 3.3–4.3%; P = 0.005, respectively). There were no significant changes in the rates of smoking during pregnancy (51–52% from 1998 to 2009, P = 0.18), small-for-gestational age (16.9–17.2%, P = 0.07), suboptimal-birthweight (20.4–20.1%, P = 0.92), stillbirths (14.7 per 1000–12.1 per 1000, P = 0.22) and neonatal deaths (6.2 per 1000–5.5 per 1000, P = 0.68).  Conclusion  Encouraging trends include reduced rates of teenage pregnancy, pre-eclampsia and antepartum haemorrhage. The persistent high rates of smoking during pregnancy, preterm births, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and increasing rates of diabetes in pregnancy are of concern	['SDG03']
10.1590/0074-02760150283	Co-administration of plasmid-encoded granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor increases human immunodeficiency virus-1 DNA vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> t-cell responses	T-cell based vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) generate specific responses that may limit both transmission and disease progression by controlling viral load. Broad, polyfunctional, and cytotoxic CD4+T-cell responses have been associated with control of simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV-1 replication, supporting the inclusion of CD4+ T-cell epitopes in vaccine formulations. Plasmid-encoded granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (pGM-CSF) co-administration has been shown to induce potent CD4+ T-cell responses and to promote accelerated priming and increased migration of antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells. However, no study has shown whether co-immunisation with pGM-CSF enhances the number of vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4+ T-cells. Our group has previously developed a DNA vaccine encoding conserved, multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR binding HIV-1 subtype B peptides, which elicited broad, polyfunctional and long-lived CD4+ T-cell responses. Here, we show that pGM-CSF co-immunisation improved both magnitude and quality of vaccine-induced T-cell responses, particularly by increasing proliferating CD4+ T-cells that produce simultaneously interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-2. Thus, we believe that the use of pGM-CSF may be helpful for vaccine strategies focused on the activation of anti-HIV CD4+ T-cell immunity	['SDG03']

However, the sex-stratified smoking trajectories of older adults are not often examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the smoking trajectories of older adults and their associated factors by sex.MethodsData were drawn from a nationally representative longitudinal study of a sample of Taiwanese adults aged 50–66 years (n = 2097). The samples were followed from 1996 to 2007. Group-based trajectory analysis was performed.ResultsThree smoking trajectories were identified in men: non/rare smokers (42.6%), quitting smokers (16.5%), and chronic smokers (40.9%). Among men, quitting smokers were more likely to be lower educated than non/rare smokers. The male chronic smokers were more likely to be older, lower educated, and living in rural areas than the male non/rare smokers. Two smoking trajectories were identified for females: non/rare smokers (95.9%) and smokers (4.1%). Women of mainlander ethnic groups were more likely to be smokers.ConclusionThere are sex differences in the smoking trajectories and related factors among older adults. Tobacco control programs should be sensitive to the sex of the target population	['SDG03']

10.3855/jidc.6875	Fostering prevention and care delivery services capability on HIV pandemic and Ebola outbreak symbiosis in Africa	Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the re-emerging Ebola virus disease (EVD) are closely intertwined and remain a persistent public health threat and global challenge. Their origin and rapid transmission and spread have similar boundaries and share overlapping impact characteristics, including related symptoms and other interactions. The controversies and global threat of these viruses require rapid response policy and evidence-based implementation findings. The constraints and dual burden inflicted by Ebola and HIV infections are highly characterized by similar socio-demographics, socio-economic and political factors. EVD has similar effects and burdens to HIV infection. This study seeks to understand EVD in the context of HIV epidemic despite the challenges in developing an effective vaccine against HIV and EVD. Our findings show that early understanding, prevention and treatment of these diseases a global health threat mainly in Africa is important and valuable. The lessons learned so far from HIV and Ebola epidemics are crucial in health programming and execution of rapid response interventions and continued vigilance against EVD before it become another worldwide health menace. Therefore, the current regional West Africa EVD requires strengthening healthcare systems and building preparedness and response capacity. Importantly, appropriate community participation, health education and resilience coupled with deployment of effective novel diagnostic approaches in early warning and surveillance of threats and emerging diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel key strategies are crucial in curbing the constant viral resurgence, persistence transmission dynamics and spread, as well in accelerating Ebola vaccines regimen (immunization) development and national implementation plans in achieving sustained control, and eventual elimination	['SDG03']

Report on the 16th annual general meeting of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network, 05-07th October 2015, Bangkok, Thailand.	AbstractThe Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) assembled high-profile leaders from global health organisations and vaccine manufactures for its 16th Annual General Meeting to work towards a common goal: providing quality vaccines for all people.Vaccines contribute to a healthy community and robust health system; the Ebola outbreak has raised awareness of the threat and damage one single infectious disease can make, and it is clear that the world was not prepared. However, more research to better understand emerging infectious agents might lead to suitable vaccines which help prevent future outbreaks.DCVMN members presented their progress in developing novel vaccines against Dengue, HPV, Chikungunya, Cholera, cell-based influenza and other vaccines, demonstrating the commitment towards eliminating and eradicating preventable diseases worldwide through global collaboration and technology transfer. The successful introduction of novel Sabin-IPV and Oral Cholera vaccine in China and Korea respectively in 2015 was highlighted.In order to achieve global immunisation, local authorities and community leaders play an important role in the decision-making in vaccine introduction and uptake, based on the ability of vaccines to protect vaccinated people and protect non-vaccinated in the community through herd immunity. Reducing the risk of vaccine shortages can also be achieved by increasing regulatory convergence at regional and international levels. Combatting preventable diseases remains challenging, and collective efforts for improving multi-centre clinical trials, creating regional vaccine security strategies, fostering developing vaccine markets and procurement, and building trust in vaccines were discussed	['SDG03']

10.4103/0971-5916.182626	High burden of hepatitis C &amp; HIV co-infection among people who inject drugs in Manipur, Northeast India	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: It is well documented that the Northeast State of Manipur in India has been dealing with the dual problems of injecting drug use and HIV for the last two decades, but the hepatitis C problem has not been so well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HCV/HIV co-infection among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Manipur, and identify factors associated with infection. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Integrated Behavioural and Biological Assessment (2009-2010), a cross-sectional survey among 821 male PWID in two districts of Manipur (Churachandpur and Bishnupur). Information about drug use, sexual and injecting risk behaviours, and exposure to interventions was obtained, and biological specimens tested for HIV and HCV. Logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with HCV infection and HCV/HIV co-infection. RESULTS: HCV prevalence was 74 per cent (91% Churachandpur, 56% Bishnupur), and HCV/HIV co-infection was 29 per cent (38% Churachandpur, 21% Bishnupur). Among the 31 per cent of HIV positive PWID, 95 per cent were co-infected. HCV infection was associated with district, longer duration of injecting, injecting at least once daily, generally injecting with a used needle and syringe, and having had an HIV test. HCV/HIV co-infection was associated with district, older age, being employed, being widowed/divorced, longer duration of injecting, and feeling at risk of HIV infection. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The HCV/HIV co-infection among PWID in Manipur was very high, highlighting the urgent need for effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment	['SDG03']

ACT UP/LA battled government, medical, and institutional neglect of the AIDS epidemic, engaging in multi-targeted protest in Los Angeles and nationally. The book shows how appealing the direct action anti-AIDS activism was for people across the United States; as well as arguing the need to understand how the politics of place affect organizing, and how the particular features of the Los Angeles cityscape shaped possibilities for activists. A feminist lens is used, seeing social inequalities as mutually reinforcing and interdependent, to examine the interaction of activists and the outcomes of their actions. Their struggle against AIDS and homophobia, and to have a voice in their healthcare, presaged the progressive, multi-issue, anti-corporate, confrontational organizing of the late twentieth century, and deserves to be part of that history.</jats:p	['SDG03']

The first section presents a brief introduction on poverty issue in Nigeria. The second section outlines the theoretical and methological approaches adopted in the paper. The third section casts a cursory look at the conceptualisation of poverty in the literature. The fourth section explores poverty‐eradication efforts in Nigeria. The fifth section highlights the failure of previous poverty reduction strategies (PRS) in Nigeria. The sixth section presents a background to MDGs. The seventh section show‐cases application of Islamic economics models (faith‐based model and business system model (BSM)) to MDGs. The eighth section is devoted to data projections, analysis and interpretation. The final section concludes with policy prescriptions.FindingsOn the basis of projection which is hinged on Shari'ah assumptions (minimum zakatable wealth and 2.5 per cent Zakat rate), the paper shows that Zakat and Sadaqat collections from year 2009 to 2015 would amount to N357,038 billions and N31 billion, respectively. These funds would go a long way in helping to alleviate poverty and actualisation of MDGs in Nigeria.Practical implicationsThe faith‐based poverty reduction strategy enriched by BSM as conceptualised in this study can be used to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (MDG 1), achieve universal primary education (MDG 2), promote gender equality and empower women (MDG 3), reduce child mortality (MDG 4), improve maternal health (MDG 5), combat, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDGs 6), ensure environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and develop a global partnership for development (MDG 8).Originality/valueThe results of this paper support the Islamic economics view that Zakat and Sadaqat are viable fiscal mechanisms for poverty alleviation where adopted. The FBM as conceptualised in this paper would therefore complement and pose a positive challenge to contemporary PRS in use in many poverty‐ridden nations where economic indicators have justified prevalence of poverty, despite the various PRS put in place by policy makers.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

Recent studies showed that ZIKV of the Asian lineage, responsible for this international outbreak, causes neuropathology in vitro and in vivo. However, two African lineages exist and the virus is currently found circulating in Africa. The original African strain was also suggested to be neurovirulent but its laboratory usage has been criticized due to its multiple passages. In this study, we compared the French Polynesian (Asian) ZIKV strain to an African strain isolated in Central African Republic and show a difference in infectivity and cellular response between both strains in human neural stem cells and astrocytes. Consistently, this African strain led to a higher infection rate and viral production, as well as stronger cell death and anti-viral response. Our results highlight the need to better characterize the physiopathology and predict neurological impairment associated with African ZIKV	['SDG03']

Corporations and their vast networks of supplier companies, particularly in manufacturing and agribusiness, employ millions of workers, increasingly comprised of young women, who lack access to health information, products and services. However, occupational safety and health practices focus primarily on safety issues and fail to address the health needs, including reproductive health, of women workers. CSR policy has focused on shaping corporate policies and practices related to the environment, labor, and human rights, but has also ignored the health needs of women workers. The authors present a new way for global health to understand CSR – as a set of regulatory processes governed by civil society, international institutions, business, and government that set, monitor, and enforce emerging standards related to the role of business in society. They call this the CSR system. They argue that the global health community needs to think differently about the role of corporations in public health, which has been as ""partners,"" and that the global health practitioners should play the same advocacy role in the CSR system for corporate health policies as it does for government and international health policies"	['SDG03']
10.15171/ijhpm.2015.30	Situation of linkage between sexual and reproductive health and HIV-related policies in Islamic Republic of Iran - A rapid assessment in 2011-2	The number of sexual transmission of HIV is increasing globally. Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) issues and HIV/AIDS related problems are rooted in common grounds such as poverty, gender inequality, and social exclusion. As a result, international health organizations have suggested the integration of SRH services with HIV/AIDS services as a strategy to control HIV and to improve people’s access to SRH services. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between reproductive health and HIV/AIDS services at policy-making level in Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI). This study was conducted in 2011–2 and was a rapid assessment based on guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Family Health International Association, and some other international organizations. In this rapid assessment we used different methods such as a review of literature and documents, visiting and interviewing professionals and experts in family health and HIV/AIDS programs, and experts working in some NonGovernmental Organizations (NGOs). Overall, based on the results obtained in this study, in most cases there was not much linkage between HIV/AIDS policies and SRH policies in Iran. Since integration of HIV/AIDS services and SRH services is recommended as a model and an appropriate response to HIV epidemics worldwide, likewise to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Iran it is required to integrate HIV/AIDS and SRH services at all levels, particularly at the policy-making level	['SDG03']

10.1159/000452950	Zika Virus-Induced Microcephaly and Its Possible Molecular Mechanism	Zika virus is an arthropod-borne re-emerging pathogen associated with the global pandemic of 2015-2016. The devastating effect of Zika viral infection is reflected by its neurological manifestations such as microcephaly in newborns. This scenario evoked our interest to uncover the neurotropic localization, multiplication of the virus, and the mechanism of microcephaly. The present report provides an overview of a possible molecular mechanism of Zika virus-induced microcephaly based on recent publications. Transplacental transmission of Zika viral infection from mother to foetus during the first trimester of pregnancy results in propagation of the virus in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), where entry is facilitated by the receptor (AXL protein) leading to the alteration of signalling and immune pathways in host cells. Further modification of the viral-induced TLR3-mediated immune network in the infected hNPCs affects viral replication. Downregulation of neurogenesis and upregulation of apoptosis in hNPCs leads to cell cycle arrest and death of the developing neurons. In addition, it is likely that the environmental, physiological, immunological, and genetic factors that determine in utero transmission of Zika virus are also involved in neurotropism. Despite the global concern regarding the Zika-mediated epidemic, the precise molecular mechanism of neuropathogenesis remains elusive.</jats:p	['SDG03']

A critical scientific and policy-relevant question is whether a threshold exists in the ozone-mortality relationship. METHODS: Using a generalized additive model and a univariate random-effects meta-analysis, this research evaluated the relationship between short-term ozone exposure and daily total mortality in seven cities of Jiangsu Province, China during 2013–2014. Spline, subset, and threshold models were applied to further evaluate whether a safe threshold level exists. RESULTS: This study found strong evidence that short-term ozone exposure is significantly associated with premature total mortality. A 10 μg/m(3) increase in the average of the current and previous days’ maximum 8-h average ozone concentration was associated with a 0.55% (95% posterior interval: 0.34%, 0.76%) increase of total mortality. This finding is robust when considering the confounding effect of PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), and SO(2). No consistent evidence was found for a threshold in the ozone-mortality concentration-response relationship down to concentrations well below the current Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard (CAAQS) level 2 standard (160 μg/m(3)). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ozone concentrations below the current CAAQS level 2 standard could still induce increased mortality risks in Jiangsu Province, China. Continuous air pollution control measures could yield important health benefits in Jiangsu Province, China, even in cities that meet the current CAAQS level 2 standard	['SDG03']

Generalized method of moment (GMM) estimators were used to estimate the impact of wood fuel consumption on under-five and adult mortality (and also male and female mortality) in the region. The findings revealed that wood fuel consumption had significant positive impact on under-five and adult mortality. It suggests that over the studied period, an increase in wood fuel consumption has increased the mortality of under-five and adult. Importantly, it indicated that the magnitude of the effect of wood fuel consumption was more on the under-five than the adults. Similarly, assessing the effect on a gender basis, it was revealed that the effect was more on female than male adults. This finding suggests that the resultant mortality from wood smoke related infections is more on under-five children than adults, and also are more on female adults than male adults. We, therefore, recommended that an alternative affordable, clean energy source for cooking and heating should be provided to reduce the wood fuel consumption	['SDG03']

Desde entonces, la presencia de este tema en la esfera pública ha llevado a varios grupos de la sociedad peruana a elaborar diversas opiniones. Aquellas que se han asentado como discursos dominantes hablan de esterilizaciones forzadas y de víctimas, mientras los funcionarios fujimoristas niegan la existencia de prácticas violatorias. Además, existen otras narrativas minoritarias que se desconocen por su escasa relevancia para el debate político, cuyas perspectivas complementan las reflexiones sobre este tema. Este artículo examina el enfoque de los discursos públicos dominantes actuales, así como el de esas otras narrativas menos conocidas, y propone una mirada crítica hacia los planteamientos victimocéntrico	['SDG03']
10.1063/1.4980927	A cluster analysis on road traffic accidents using genetic algorithms	The analysis of traffic road accidents is increasingly important because of the accidents cost and public road safety. The availability or large data sets makes the study of factors that affect the frequency and severity accidents are viable. However, the data are often highly unbalanced and overlapped. We deal with the data set of the road traffic accidents recorded in Christchurch, New Zealand, from 2000-2009 with a total of 26440 accidents. The data is in a binary set and there are 50 factors road traffic accidents with four level of severity. We used genetic algorithm for the analysis because we are in the presence of a large unbalanced data set and standard clustering like k-means algorithm may not be suitable for the task. The genetic algorithm based on clustering for unknown K, (GCUK) has been used to identify the factors associated with accidents of different levels of severity. The results provided us with an interesting insight into the relationship between factors and accidents severity level and suggest that the two main factors that contributes to fatal accidents are “Speed greater than 60 km h” and “Did not see other people until it was too late”. A comparison with the k-means algorithm and the independent component analysis is performed to validate the results	['SDG03']

The Fragility Index is a novel method for evaluating the robustness of statistically significant findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It is defined as the minimum number of patients in 1 arm of a trial that would have to change status from a nonevent to an event to alter the results of the trial from statistically significant to nonsignificant.Purpose:To calculate the Fragility Index of statistically significant results from clinical trials in sports medicine and arthroscopic surgery to characterize the robustness of the RCTs in these fields.Methods:A search was conducted in Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed for RCTs related to sports medicine and arthroscopic surgery from January 1, 2005, to October 30, 2015. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts for study eligibility, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. The Fragility Index was calculated using the Fisher exact test for all statistically significant dichotomous outcomes from parallel-group RCTs. Bivariate correlation was performed to evaluate associations between the Fragility Index and trial characteristics.Results:A total of 48 RCTs were included. The median sample size was 64 (interquartile range [IQR], 48.5-89.5), and the median total number of outcome events was 19 (IQR, 10-27). The median Fragility Index was 2 (IQR, 1-2.8), meaning that changing 2 patients from a nonevent to an event in the treatment arm changed the result to a statistically nonsignificant result, or P ≥ .05.Conclusion:Most statistically significant RCTs in sports medicine and arthroscopic surgery are not robust because their statistical significance can be reversed by changing the outcome status on only a few patients in 1 treatment group. Future work is required to determine whether routine reporting of the Fragility Index enhances clinicians’ ability to detect trial results that should be viewed cautiously.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

In this context, human activity patterns likely have a major role in Zika transmission dynamics. This paper examines the effect of host variability in the amount of time spent outdoors on Zika epidemiology in an urban environment.Methodology/principal findingsFirst, we performed a survey on time spent outdoors by residents of Miami-Dade County, Florida. Second, we analyzed both the survey and previously published national data on outdoors time in the U.S. to provide estimates of the distribution of the time spent outdoors. Third, we performed a computational modeling evaluation of Zika transmission dynamics, based on the time spent outdoors by each person. Our analysis reveals a strong heterogeneity of the host population in terms of time spent outdoors-data are well captured by skewed gamma distributions. Our model-based evaluation shows that in a heterogeneous population, Zika would cause a lower number of infections than in a more homogenous host population (up to 4-fold differences), but, at the same time, the epidemic would spread much faster. We estimated that in highly heterogeneous host populations the timing of the implementation of vector control measures is the major factor for limiting the number of Zika infections.Conclusions/significanceOur findings highlight the need of considering host variability in exposure time for managing mosquito-borne infections and call for the revision of the triggers for vector control strategies, which should integrate mosquito density data and human outdoor activity patterns in specific areas	['SDG03']

Recent recommendations from the European Medicines Agency suggest monitoring of full blood count every 4 weeks for the duration of therapy for psoriasis. The aim of our study was to assess the incidence of lymphopenia in patients taking FAEs and the impact of recent recommendations for our practice. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We reviewed 151 patients treated with FAEs for psoriasis between December 2013 and 2015. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Lymphopenia &lt;700 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L was detected within the last 12 months in 36/151 (24%) and lymphopenia &lt;500 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L in 10/151 (7%). Of 39 patients no longer on treatment, 7 (18%) stopped because of persistent lymphopenia. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The implementation of these recommendations would have significant resource implications and also likely influence the acceptability of FAEs to patients. Cessation of FAEs necessitates the need for alternative therapy, commonly biologic therapy.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1128/jvi.01765-17	Flow virometry: A powerful tool to functionally characterize viruses	ABSTRACT           For several decades, flow cytometry has been a common approach to analyze cells and sort them to near-purity. It enables one to probe inner cellular molecules, surface receptors, or infected cells. However, the analysis of smaller entities such as viruses and exocytic vesicles has been more difficult but is becoming mainstream. This has in part been due to the development of new instrumentation with resolutions below that of conventional cytometers. It is also attributed to the several means employed to fluorescently label viruses, hence enabling them to stand out from similarly sized particles representing background noise. Thus far, more than a dozen different viruses ranging in size from 40 nm to giant viruses have been probed by this approach, which was recently dubbed “flow virometry.” These studies have collectively highlighted the breadth of the applications of this method, which, for example, has elucidated the maturation of dengue virus, served as quality control for vaccinia vaccines, and enabled the sorting of herpes simplex virus discrete viral particles. The present review focuses on the means employed to characterize and sort viruses by this powerful technology and on the emerging uses of flow virometry. It similarly addresses some of its current challenges and limitations.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1177/0956462418766932	Reproductive decision-making among postpartum HIV-infected women in rural South Africa	Despite pregnancy spacing recommendations to optimize health outcomes among mothers and neonates, unplanned pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa is common among women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (WLHIV). This study examined factors associated with reproductive decision-making among WLHIV to inform pregnancy-planning interventions. WLHIV in rural South Africa (n = 165) were assessed at 12 months postpartum. The relative importance of factors associated with reproductive decision-making was estimated. Women were a mean of 28 years old (SD = 5.71). Risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV (Mean = 0.43; SD = 0.33) had the greatest impact on decision-making, followed by partners’ desires (M = 0.22; SD = 0.18), family preferences (M = 0.18; SD = 0.13), and community opinion (M = 0.17; SD = 0.13). MTCT was most important to women with greater HIV knowledge. However, WLHIV who had been diagnosed with HIV for a longer time placed more emphasis on partner preference and community opinion, and less importance on MTCT risk. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) was less important to women experiencing intimate partner violence and those with depression. Findings highlight the need for tailored, focused interventions to support the unique circumstances of WLHIV and support the inclusion of families and/or partners in the counseling process. Results underscore the need for perinatal preconception counseling for women during routine HIV care. </jats:p	['SDG03']

We estimated health care utilization and expenditures attributable to cigar smoking among US adults aged ≥35. Methods: We analyzed data on 84 178 adults using the 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 National Health Interview Surveys. We estimated zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models on hospital nights, emergency department (ED) visits, physician visits, and home-care visits as a function of tobacco use status—current sole cigar smokers (ie, smoke cigars only), current poly cigar smokers (smoke cigars and smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco), former sole cigar smokers (used to smoke cigars only), former poly cigar smokers (used to smoke cigars and smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco), other tobacco users (ever smoked cigarettes and used smokeless tobacco but not cigars), and never tobacco users (never smoked cigars, smoked cigarettes, or used smokeless tobacco)—and other covariates. We calculated health care utilization attributable to current and former sole cigar smoking based on the estimated ZIP models, and then we calculated total health care expenditures attributable to cigar smoking. Results: Current and former sole cigar smoking was associated with excess annual utilization of 72 137 hospital nights, 32 748 ED visits, and 420 118 home-care visits. Annual health care expenditures attributable to sole cigar smoking were $284 million ($625 per sole cigar smoker), and total annual health care expenditures attributable to sole and poly cigar smoking were $1.75 billion. Conclusions: Comprehensive tobacco control policies and interventions are needed to reduce cigar smoking and the associated health care burden. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

Reproductive health among this age group is often overlooked, although it can have a profound impact on the future. This is especially the case in conflict zones and refugee settings, where there is a heightened need for reproductive health care, and where both the resources and possibility for data collation are usually limited.  Methods Here we report on pregnancies, birth outcomes and risk factors for repeat pregnancies among adolescent and young adult refugees and migrants from antenatal clinics on the Thailand-Myanmar border across a 30 year time span. Results Pregnancy and fertility rates were persistently high. Compared with 20-24-year-olds, 15-19-year-olds who reported being unable to read had 2.35 (CI: 1.97 – 2.81) times the odds for repeat pregnancy (gravidity >2). In primigravidae, the proportion of small for gestational age (SGA) and preterm births (PTB), and neonatal deaths (NND) decreased with increasing maternal age (all p <0.001). After adjustment, this association retained significance for PTB (cut-off point, ≤18 years) but not for SGA and NND. Conclusions There is considerable room for improvement in adolescent pregnancy rates in these border populations, and educational opportunities may play a key role in effective interventions	['SDG03']

However, the use of PND and PGD is controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate attitudes toward, and experiences with, childhood DNA testing, PND and PGD among members of families at high risk for FAP. In this nationwide, cross-sectional study, questionnaires were sent to individuals from families at high risk for FAP assessing attitudes toward and experiences with childhood testing, PND and PGD, as well as several sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables.  Of the individuals from FAP families invited to participate in the study, 525 members participated (response rate=64%). Most parents who had children who were minors (n=93) (82%) were satisfied with the DNA testing procedure. One-third of all individuals wanted DNA testing for their children before age 12. Forty percent of FAP patients indicated that the disease influenced their desire to have children. Only 15% considered termination of pregnancy for FAP acceptable. Approximately 30% of individuals with a FAP diagnosis and their partners considered PND and PGD as acceptable for themselves. A positive attitude was associated with higher levels of guilt and a positive attitude toward termination of pregnancy. Importantly, of those with FAP at childbearing age, 84% had had no previous information at all about either PND or PGD. Future efforts should be aimed at educating FAP family members about reproductive options, allowing them to make an informed choice about family planning.

METHODS: A sample of 152 urban mothers was interviewed on measures of substance use, diagnosis of depression, anger arousal and reactivity, and child abuse potential. RESULTS: Linear hierarchical regressions revealed that anger arousal and reactivity exceeded diagnostic and demographic variables in predicting maternal child abuse potential. Additionally, anger arousal and reactivity was found to be a partial mediator of the relationship between diagnostic category and child abuse potential. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are discussed in relation to a multifaceted model of child abuse potential which broadens the existing literature to include an examination of depression and emotion regulation in order to more fully understand how substance use and child abuse potential are linked. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Models and approaches which help clients to manage and regulate difficult feeling states, specifically anger, could be helpful, and may be most readily applied in such populations	['SDG03']

10.1614/wt-08-157.1	Sulfentrazone carryover to vegetables and cotton	Sulfentrazone is commonly used for weed control in soybeans and tobacco, and vegetable crops and cotton are often rotated with soybeans and tobacco. Studies were conducted to evaluate the potential for sulfentrazone to carryover and injure several vegetable crops and cotton. Sulfentrazone was applied PRE to soybean at 0, 210, 420, and 840 g ai/ha before planting bell pepper, cabbage, cotton, cucumber, onion, snap bean, squash, sweet potato, tomato, and watermelon. Cotton, known to be susceptible to sulfentrazone carryover, was included as an indicator species. Cotton injury ranged from 14 to 18% with a 32% loss of yield in 1 of 2 yr when the labeled use rate of sulfentrazone (210 g/ha) was applied to the preceding crop. High use rates of sulfentrazone caused at least 50% injury with yield loss ranging from 36 to 100%. Bell pepper, snap bean, onion, tomato, and watermelon were injured &lt; 18% by sulfentrazone at 840 g/ha. Squash was injured &lt; 3% and &lt; 36% by sulfentrazone at 210 and 840 g/ha, respectively. Yield of these crops was not affected regardless of sulfentrazone rate. Cabbage and cucumber were injured &lt; 13% by sulfentrazone at 210 and 420 g/ha, and yields were not affected. Sulfentrazone at 840 g/ha injured cabbage up to 46% and reduced yield in 1 of 2 yr. Sulfentrazone injured cucumber up to 63% and reduced yield of No. 2 grade fruits. Sulfentrazone at 210 and 420 g/ha injured sweet potato &lt; 6% and did not affect yield. Sulfentrazone at 840 g/ha injured sweet potato 14% and reduced total yield 26%. Our results suggest little to no adverse effect on bell pepper, cabbage, cucumber, onion, snap bean, squash, sweet potato, tomato, or watermelon from sulfentrazone applied at registered use rates during the preceding year.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Jelenleg hazánkban az injektáló kábítószer-használók körében a hepatitis C (HCV) előfordulási aránya Budapesten 35% körüli, vidéken pedig 20% alatti, és verifikált emberi immunhiányt okozó vírus (HIV) -fertőzést nem regisztráltak körükben. Matematikai modellek szerint a HCV és a HIV járványtana ebben a kockázati csoportban egybefonódik: amíg a HCV előfordulása körülbelül 35% alatti, a HIV-járvány valószínűsége nagyon csekély, e határ átlépése után viszont egyre terjedő HIV-járványra számíthatunk. E modellek szerint a hazai, főleg a fővárosi, injektáló kábítószer-használók körében egyre nő egy átfogó HIV-járvány valószínűsége. Négy fő módon lehet egy ilyen HIV-járványt késleltetni, illetve minimalizálni: 1. helyettesítő kezelési programokkal; 2. injektáló eszközök legális hozzáférésével; 3. tanácsadással egybekötött, ingyenes, anonim HIV- és HCV-gyorsteszteléssel; és 4. higiénikus injektálási körülmények biztosításával. Az injektáló kábítószer-használók jelenlegi HCV-járványtani helyzete nemcsak mielőbbi széles körű és átfogó megelőzési választ kíván az előrejelzéseken alapuló HIV-járvány elkerülése érdekében, főleg a fővárosban, hanem a járványtani helyzet rendszeres monitorozását is. A megelőzési programok sikeressége két kulcstényezőn múlik: 1. széles körű hozzáférhetőség és 2. folyamatos állami finanszírozás.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1186/1742-4690-7-11	sCD4-17b bifunctional protein: Extremely broad and potent neutralization of HIV-1 Env pseudotyped viruses from genetically diverse primary isolates	BACKGROUND: We previously described a potent recombinant HIV-1 neutralizing protein, sCD4-17b, composed of soluble CD4 attached via a flexible polypeptide linker to an SCFv of the 17b human monoclonal antibody directed against the highly conserved CD4-induced bridging sheet of gp120 involved in coreceptor binding. The sCD4 moiety of the bifunctional protein binds to gp120 on free virions, thereby enabling the 17b SCFv moiety to bind and block the gp120/coreceptor interaction required for entry. The previous studies using the MAGI-CCR5 assay system indicated that sCD4-17b (in concentrated cell culture medium, or partially purified) potently neutralized several genetically diverse HIIV-1 primary isolates; however, at the concentrations tested it was ineffective against several other strains despite the conservation of binding sites for both CD4 and 17b. To address this puzzle, we designed variants of sCD4-17b with different linker lengths, and tested the neutralizing activities of the immunoaffinity purified proteins over a broader concentration range against a large number of genetically diverse HIV-1 primary isolates, using the TZM-bl Env pseudotype assay system. We also examined the sCD4-17b sensitivities of isogenic viruses generated from different producer cell types. RESULTS: We observed that immunoaffinity purified sCD4-17b effectively neutralized HIV-1 pseudotypes, including those from HIV-1 isolates previously found to be relatively insensitive in the MAGI-CCR5 assay. The potencies were equivalent for the original construct and a variant with a longer linker, as observed with both pseudotype particles and infectious virions; by contrast, a construct with a linker too short to enable simultaneous binding of the sCD4 and 17b SCFv moieties was much less effective. sCD4-17b displayed potent neutralizing activity against 100% of nearly 4 dozen HIV-1 primary isolates from diverse genetic subtypes (clades A, B, C, D, F, and circulating recombinant forms AE and AG). The neutralization breadth and potency were superior to what have been reported for the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies IgG b12, 2G12, 2F5, and 4E10. The activity of sCD4-17b was found to be similar against isogenic virus particles from infectious molecular clones derived either directly from the transfected producer cell line or after a single passage through PBMCs; this contrasted with the monoclonal antibodies, which were less potent against the PMBC-passaged viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the extremely potent and broad neutralizing activity of sCD4-17b against genetically diverse HIV-1 primary isolates. The bifunctional protein has potential applications for antiviral approaches to combat HIV infection	['SDG03']

10.1177/003335491012500211	The association of workplace hazards and smoking in a U.S. Multiethnic Working-Class Population	Objective. We investigated the extent to which smoking status was associated with exposure to occupational (e.g., dust, chemicals, noise, and ergonomic strain) and social (e.g., abuse, sexual harassment, and racial discrimination) workplace hazards in a sample of U.S. multiethnic working-class adults. Methods. United for Health is a cross-sectional study designed to investigate the combined burden of occupational and social workplace hazards in relation to race/ethnicity, gender, and wage and to evaluate related health effects in a working-class population. Using validated measures, we collected data from 1,282 multiethnic working-class participants using audio computer-assisted interviews. We used multiple imputation methods to impute data for those missing data. Crude and adjusted logistic odds ratios (ORs) were modeled to estimate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. The prevalence of smoking was highest among non-Hispanic white workers (38.3%) and lowest for foreign-born workers (13.1%). We found an association between racial discrimination and smoking (OR=1.12, 95% CI 1.01, 1.25). The relationship between smoking and sexual harassment, although not significant, was different for black women compared with men (OR=1.79, 95% CI 0.99, 3.22). We did not find any associations by workplace abuse or by any of the occupational hazards. Conclusion. These results indicate that racial discrimination might be related to smoking in working-class populations and should be considered in tobacco-control efforts that target this high-risk population. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

10.1159/000282077	Hepatitis D: Clinical features and therapy	Surveys in the 1980s showed that the hepatitis D virus (HDV) is endemic worldwide, though with prevalences and patterns of infection varying in different areas. Medical scrutiny confirmed that chronic hepatitis D usually runs a severe and progressive course, the prototype patient having HBsAg in blood, elevated ALT, a liver biopsy exhibiting aggressive hepatitis and markers of HDV (but no marker of HBV replication in serum). Although the circulation of HDV has declined significantly following the control of HBV achieved over the last 20 years, depriving HDV of the HBV network necessary to propagate its infection, there is still a consistent reservoir of the virus in Europe, sustained by two different pools of HDV-infected patients: the residual ageing domestic pool that survived the brunt of the hepatitis D epidemic in the 1970s and 1980s and the population of young patients with recent HDV infections migrating to Europe. Therapy of hepatitis D remains an unsolved business. The therapy available today is not different from the limited interferon treatment attempted more than 20 years ago. The problem is formidable as HDV has no enzymatic protein to be targeted by conventional antiviral therapy. A potential target of therapy is offered by the process of hepatitis D virion assembly.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1586/eri.10.60	New drugs and regimens for treatment of TB	Tools for effective TB control have been available for years. Case finding, active medications, case management and directly observed therapy are the foundations for the management of TB. The current TB epidemic, centered in resource-limited settings is fueled by the HIV-1 epidemic. Lack of ability to diagnose and treat drug-resistant TB has led to development of more extensive patterns of resistance. Among the currently available drugs, there is reason to hope that rifamycins paired with fluoroquinolones will lead to shorter treatment regimens for drug-susceptible TB. As the result of novel public-private collaborations and investments of resources, new drugs are being developed. These include TMC207, already shown to have activity early in the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB and others that are likely to be active against persistor organisms, and have the prospect to dramatically shorten treatment courses for active and latent TB. Given that these drugs have novel mechanisms of action, combinations have the prospect to be highly active even against multidrug-resistant organisms	['SDG03']

10.1136/tc.2009.033415	Public support in England for a total ban on the sale of tobacco products	This study aimed to determine the level of support for a sales ban on tobacco in England to provide a benchmark against which any changes over time can be assessed.8735 people from England who participated in one of five monthly cross-sectional household surveys in 2008 were asked to indicate whether they would support the statement that 'the government should work towards banning the sale of tobacco completely within the next 10 years'. In addition, sociodemographic and smoking characteristics were assessed.A substantial proportion of the total sample (44.5%; 95% CI 43.5% to 45.6%) would support a move towards a complete ban. While never smokers (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.82 to 2.25) and ex-smokers (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.65) were more likely to support this idea, even among current smokers, a third would favour moving towards a sales ban of tobacco products. Adjusting for other background characteristics, younger, female participants, those living in London and those from lower socioeconomic groups were most likely to support a ban. Among smokers, a higher cigarette consumption, smoking enjoyment and contentment with being a smoker were associated with opposition to a ban, while feeling uncomfortable being a smoker, wanting to be a non-smoker and being worried about future health consequences of smoking were associated with support for a ban.Support for movement towards a ban on the sale of tobacco is higher than might be imagined. It is conceivable that as smoking prevalence falls further and smoking becomes more socially unacceptable, support might grow to a point where such a policy could become feasible	['SDG03']

We focus on studies that evaluate POC diagnostic tests for the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria, tools that are central to the WHO prevention guidelines for infectious diseases in developing countries. Although rapid diagnostic tests for HIV and malaria seem to be cost-effective in these standard analyses, these do not take into account the reduction in patients’ waiting time and the number of clinic visits required to receive results, or future benefits from the reduction in antimalarial drug pressure. Those additional cost reductions would be considerably greater with POC rapid tests, and the cost-effectiveness of POC tests would therefore be improved. Findings from cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that, despite the relatively small additional cost incurred, decision-makers should strongly consider using POC tests throughout or during parts of HIV and malaria epidemics, where this is feasible in terms of local human resources and logistical conditions	['SDG03']

The period covered by the study reported on here corresponds with that of the Report, allowing for a comparison of achievements and challenges in one primary health care centre vis-a-vis the WHO standards. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study uses qualitative and quantitative data from a rural primary care facility in Western Maharashtra, collected over three decades. It analyzes the four groups of reforms defined by WHO in the context of the achievements and challenges of the study facility. RESULTS: According to the WHO Report, health systems in developing countries have not responded adequately to people’s needs. However, our in-depth observations revealed substantial progress in several areas, including in family planning, safe deliveries, immunization and health promotion. Satisfaction with services in the study area was high. CONCLUSION: Adequate primary health care is possible, even when all recommended WHO reforms are not fully in place	['SDG03']

According to numerous official sources, in some pharmaceutical wholesalers in African countries, the proportion has reached 80%. Unfortunately, this situation is far to be improved due to lack of suitable analytical equipment allowing rapid actions of the Regulatory Agencies based on scientific consideration, at affordable cost and all over the drug supply chain. For that purpose, a network group considered that mater by building a low-cost original capillary electrophoresis (CE) equipment equipped with a new deep UV detector based on LED technology. The generic conditions for analysis were investigated: capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) performed at acidic pH for basic drug molecules (i.e., quinine, highly used as the last antimalarial rampart), basic pH for compounds such as furosemide (a common diuretic drug) and at neutral pH for a well known antibiotic combination, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol. To evaluate the ability of the CE equipment for quantification, a full validation and a method comparison study were carried out for the CZE method dedicated to quinine determination. The validation involved the use of accuracy profile and total error concept to monitor the adequacy of the results obtained by the new prototype. The method comparison was based on the Bland and Altman approach by comparing results obtained by the low-cost CE and a conventional set-up. Subsequent validation studies were realized with neutral and acidic drug molecules, each focusing on a single concentration level calibration curve in order to maintain as low as possible the expenses due to reagents and thus the cost of analysis, as important advantages of CE for drug quality control	['SDG03']

Finally, general remarks are made about the Russian Federation's secondary legislation in the SPS area. Instances of non-compliance with international norms, found by the authors, may contribute to trade difficulties with other countries and likely will need to be addressed as part of Russia's negotiations to join the WTO and, also, to remove some of the difficulties in trade with the EU.          </jats:sec	['SDG03']

10.1289/ehp.0901220	An estimate of the global burden of anthropogenic ozone and fine particulate matter on premature human mortality using atmospheric modeling	BACKGROUND: Ground-level concentrations of ozone (O(3)) and fine particulate matter [≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5))] have increased since preindustrial times in urban and rural regions and are associated with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. OBJECTIVES: We estimated the global burden of mortality due to O(3) and PM(2.5) from anthropogenic emissions using global atmospheric chemical transport model simulations of preindustrial and present-day (2000) concentrations to derive exposure estimates. METHODS: Attributable mortalities were estimated using health impact functions based on long-term relative risk estimates for O(3) and PM(2.5) from the epidemiology literature. Using simulated concentrations rather than previous methods based on measurements allows the inclusion of rural areas where measurements are often unavailable and avoids making assumptions for background air pollution. RESULTS: Anthropogenic O(3) was associated with an estimated 0.7 ± 0.3 million respiratory mortalities (6.3 ± 3.0 million years of life lost) annually. Anthropogenic PM(2.5) was associated with 3.5 ± 0.9 million cardiopulmonary and 220,000 ± 80,000 lung cancer mortalities (30 ± 7.6 million years of life lost) annually. Mortality estimates were reduced approximately 30% when we assumed low-concentration thresholds of 33.3 ppb for O(3) and 5.8 μg/m(3) for PM(2.5). These estimates were sensitive to concentration thresholds and concentration–mortality relationships, often by > 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropogenic O(3) and PM(2.5) contribute substantially to global premature mortality. PM(2.5) mortality estimates are about 50% higher than previous measurement-based estimates based on common assumptions, mainly because of methodologic differences. Specifically, we included rural populations, suggesting higher estimates; however, the coarse resolution of the global atmospheric model may underestimate urban PM(2.5) exposures	['SDG03']

10.1017/s002193201000009x	Role of induced abortion in attaining reproductive goals in Kyrgyzstan: A study based on KRDHS-1997	SummaryEstimates indicate that about 42 million pregnancies are voluntarily terminated every year at the global level, of which more than 80% occur in developing countries. Abortion has been one of the major reproductive health concerns in post-Soviet nations, especially when it is commonly used as a means of fertility regulation. On average, every woman has had around 1.6 abortions in Kyrgyzstan. This paper attempts to measure the role of abortion in fertility regulation using data from the Kyrgyz Republic Demographic and Health Survey (KRDHS), 1997. The analysis reveals that Kyrgyzstan can attain replacement level fertility in the absence of induced abortion by raising the contraceptive prevalence to 70% at the current level of effectiveness. The study also shows that women's attitude towards becoming pregnant and their partner's perception about abortion are significantly associated with the propensity to opt for an induced abortion. Reproductive health programmes need to address these issues, including the enhancement of male involvement in family planning.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.2190/iq.30.3.c	Keeping kids smokefree: Rationale, design, and implementation of a community, school, and family-based intervention to modify behaviors related to smoking among Maori and Pacific Island children in New Zealand	Despite a concerted, sustained and comprehensive tobacco control effort, smoking is prevalent among young people in New Zealand, particularly for Māori and Pacific Island teenagers. Many took up smoking in their pre-teen years. New Zealand research has shown that daily smoking by children aged 14–15 years is strongly influenced by parental smoking. The Keeping Kids Smokefree study is investigating whether changing parental smoking behavior and attitudes via a community-partnership approach with parents, schools, and local health providers can reduce smoking initiation by 11–12 year olds. It is a quasi-experimental trial involving four schools in an urban area of high social deprivation with large numbers of Māori and Pacific Islands families. Schools were allocated to intervention or control and the intervention was developed through a process of engagement with the schools, parents of children and local healthcare organizations. This article describes the rationale, context, methodology and methods involved in establishing the study. Building Māori and Pacific Islander research capacity was a secondary objective of the study. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1371/journal.pone.0013646	Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Its Impact on HIV-1 Transmission in South Africa	Mathematical modelers have given little attention to the question of how pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may impact on a generalized national HIV epidemic and its cost-effectiveness, in the context of control strategies such as condom use promotion and expanding ART programs.We use an age- and gender-structured model of the generalized HIV epidemic in South Africa to investigate the potential impact of PrEP in averting new infections. The model utilizes age-structured mortality, fertility, partnership and condom use data to model the spread of HIV and the shift of peak prevalence to older age groups. The model shows that universal PrEP coverage would have to be impractically high to have a significant effect on incidence reduction while ART coverage expands. PrEP targeted to 15–35-year-old women would avert 10%–25% (resp. 13%–28%) of infections in this group and 5%–12% (resp. 7%–16%) of all infections in the period 2014–2025 if baseline incidence is 0.5% per year at 2025 (resp. 0.8% per year at 2025). The cost would be $12,500–$20,000 per infection averted, depending on the level of ART coverage and baseline incidence. An optimistic scenario of 30%–60% PrEP coverage, efficacy of at least 90%, no behavior change among PrEP users and ART coverage less than three times its 2010 levels is required to achieve this result. Targeting PrEP to 25–35-year-old women (at highest risk of infection) improves impact and cost-effectiveness marginally. Relatively low levels of condom substitution (e.g., 30%) do not nullify the efficacy of PrEP, but reduces cost-effectiveness by 35%–40%. individuals. To have a high relative cost-effective impact on reducing infections in generalized epidemics, PrEP must utilize a window of opportunity until ART has been scaled up beyond this level	['SDG03']

10.1159/000320332	Reducing global neonatal mortality is possible	&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt; The global neonatal mortality of 28/1,000 live births is unacceptably high. Furthermore, the huge difference in mortality between high- and low-income countries and regions is presently one of the most burning human rights issues. The decline in neonatal mortality has been slow and is a main reason the Millennium Development Goal 4 does not seem to have been reached. &lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt; Several countries have shown it is possible to reduce neonatal mortality quickly and dramatically without much cost. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; It is important to learn from the successful countries and focus on the 3–4 major causes of neonatal death: asphyxia, infection, low birth weight/prematurity and congenital malformations. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; A reasonable short-term goal is to reduce global neonatal mortality to 15/1,000 which can be achieved without introduction of high technology medicine. A further reduction of mortality to 5/1,000 should be the next global goal. Reaching this would reduce the present 3.8 million annual deaths by 3 million. In order to do this, regionalization of health care should be implemented. Maternal health should be the focus, with free antenatal care and centralized deliveries with health personnel attending the birth. Education of girls is perhaps the best way to prevent perinatal and neonatal deaths. Ten simple recommendations are given to reduce neonatal mortality. One of these is that each newborn baby in the world should have free access to essential drugs. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; It is possible to reduce newborn mortality in all countries and regions. Most important to achieve these goals is, however, political will.</jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.envint.2010.09.004	Constrained confidence intervals in time series studies of mortality and air pollution	This paper focuses on constrained confidence intervals in the context of environmental time series studies where one seeks to ascertain the effects of ambient air pollution on human mortality. If the regression parameter representing such effects is non-negative, corresponding to a belief that more pollution cannot be beneficial, a desirable goal is to produce a constrained confidence interval for the parameter which is entirely non-negative. We show how this goal can be achieved using the method of tail functions. The proposed methodology is illustrated by the application to an environmental study of 100 cities in the United States involving regressions of mortality counts on levels of particulate matter air pollution. The large number of constrained CIs that contain zero is an indication that for the majority of the 100 cities there is not enough evidence to conclude a positive association between air pollution and mortality	['SDG03']

This was in response to the KZN circular 116 of 2000, which seemed to give more rights to pregnant learners. Subjects were educators (n=97) from twenty secondary schools. The study further investigated the relationship (if any) that existed between the educators’ attitudes towards teenage pregnancy and various educators’ characteristics such as age, gender, religious affiliation, educational level and their teaching experience. A questionnaire was developed and administered to the selected sample. The findings indicated that educators had positive attitudes and were sympathetic towards pregnant teenagers, but displayed reservations about the level of skills they possessed with regard to helping teenagers in times of emergency (like delivery) in the classroom. The study formulated some recommendations that the researchers thought would strengthen the relationship between educators and pregnant teenagers in schools	['SDG03']
10.1177/0898264310374354	Lifetime marital history and mortality after age 50	Objectives: This article examines the relationship between lifetime marital history and mortality after age 50. Method: Data are drawn from the Health and Retirement Study birth cohort of 1931 to 1941. The analysis utilizes three measures of marital history: number of marriages, proportion time married, and age at first marriage. Results: Three or more marriages and a lower proportion of adult life spent married are each associated with a higher hazard of dying after age 50 for both men and women even after controlling for current marital status and socioeconomic status. Smoking behavior accounts for part of the relationship of marital history and status with mortality. Discussion: Research on marital status and health should consider marital history as well as current status. Two topics are particularly important: examining the relationship in different cohorts and disentangling the potentially causal role of health behaviors such as smoking. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1186/1471-2431-11-11	The motor development of orphaned children with and without HIV: Pilot exploration of foster care and residential placement	BACKGROUND: The AIDS epidemic has lead to an increase in orphaned children who need residential care. It is known that HIV leads to delayed motor development. However, the impact of place of residence on motor function has not been investigated in the South African context. The aim of the study was therefore to establish if children in institutionalised settings performed better or worse in terms of gross motor function than their counterparts in foster care. A secondary objective was to compare the performance of children with HIV in these two settings with those of children who were HIV negative. METHODS: Forty-four children both with and without HIV, were recruited from institutions and foster care families in Cape Town. The Peabody Development Motor Scale (PDMS II) was used to calculate the total motor quotient (TMQ) at baseline and six months later. Comparisons of TMQ were made between residential settings and between children with and without HIV. RESULTS: Twenty-one children were infected with HIV and were significantly delayed compared to their healthy counterparts. Antiretroviral therapy was well managed among the group but did not appear to result in restoration of TMQ to normal over the study period. HIV status and place of residence emerged as a predictor of TMQ with children in residential care performing better than their counterparts in foster care. All children showed improvement over the six months of study. CONCLUSIONS: Foster parents were well supported administratively in the community by social welfare services but their children might have lacked stimulation in comparison to those in institutional settings. This could have been due to a lack of resources and knowledge regarding child development. The assumption that foster homes provide a better alternative to institutions may not be correct in a resource poor community and needs to be examined further	['SDG03']

This study investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was associated with lean body mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in men. DESIGN: Population-based, observational survey PARTICIPANTS: 1,219 black, Hispanic, and white randomly-selected men aged 30–79 y from the Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey MEASUREMENTS: Lean body mass by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, hand-grip strength, a composite physical function score (chair stand and walking speed), 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), testosterone, age, race, body mass index, socioeconomic status, education, smoking, arthritis, self-reported health, calcium intake, physical activity. RESULTS: The distributions of serum 25(OH)D quartiles differed by race/ethnicity, education, and smoking status. After adjustment for multiple lifestyle factors, serum 25(OH)D was not related to lean body mass, grip strength, or the composite physical function score (all p>0.20). There was no variation in the associations between 25(OH)D level and outcomes by race/ethnicity. The relationship between PTH and the outcomes revealed similar results. CONCLUSION: In this population-based sample of adult men with a broad age range, there was no association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and lean body mass, muscle strength, and physical function after controlling for multiple lifestyle factors	['SDG03']

Design Prospective, cluster randomised and controlled effectiveness study. Setting Lufwanyama, an agrarian, poorly developed district located in the Copperbelt province, Zambia. All births carried out by study birth attendants occurred at mothers’ homes, in rural village settings. Participants 127 traditional birth attendants and mothers and their newborns (3559 infants delivered regardless of vital status) from Lufwanyama district. Interventions Using an unblinded design, birth attendants were cluster randomised to intervention or control groups. The intervention had two components: training in a modified version of the neonatal resuscitation protocol, and single dose amoxicillin coupled with facilitated referral of infants to a health centre. Control birth attendants continued their existing standard of care (basic obstetric skills and use of clean delivery kits). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the proportion of liveborn infants who died by day 28 after birth, with rate ratios statistically adjusted for clustering. Secondary outcomes were mortality at different time points; and comparison of causes of death based on verbal autopsy data. Results Among 3497 deliveries with reliable information, mortality at day 28 after birth was 45% lower among liveborn infants delivered by intervention birth attendants than control birth attendants (rate ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.90). The greatest reductions in mortality were in the first 24 hours after birth: 7.8 deaths per 1000 live births for infants delivered by intervention birth attendants compared with 19.9 per 1000 for infants delivered by control birth attendants (0.40, 0.19 to 0.83). Deaths due to birth asphyxia were reduced by 63% among infants delivered by intervention birth attendants (0.37, 0.17 to 0.81) and by 81% within the first two days after birth (0.19, 0.07 to 0.52). Stillbirths and deaths from serious infection occurred at similar rates in both groups. Conclusions Training traditional birth attendants to manage common perinatal conditions significantly reduced neonatal mortality in a rural African setting. This approach has high potential to be applied to similar settings with dispersed rural populations. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00518856	['SDG03']
10.2165/11584930-000000000-00000	Cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against acute otitis media in children: A review	Item does not contain fulltextWhile pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have shown to be highly effective against invasive pneumococcal disease, their potential effectiveness against acute otitis media (AOM) might become a major economic driver for implementing these vaccines in national immunization programmes. However, the relationship between the costs and benefits of available vaccines remains a controversial topic. Our objective is to systematically review the literature on the cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against AOM in children. We searched PubMed, Cochrane and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE], NHS Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED] and Health Technology Assessment database [HTA]) from inception until 18 February 2010. We used the following keywords with their synonyms: 'otitis media', 'children', 'cost-effectiveness', 'costs' and 'vaccine'. Costs per AOM episode averted were calculated based on the information in this literature. A total of 21 studies evaluating the cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were included. The quality of the included studies was moderate to good. The cost per AOM episode averted varied from &U20AC;168 to &U20AC;4214, and assumed incidence rates varied from 20,952 to 118,000 per 100,000 children aged 0-10 years. Assumptions regarding direct and indirect costs varied between studies. The assumed vaccine efficacy of the 7-valent pneumococcal CRM197-conjugate vaccine was mainly adopted from two trials, which reported 6-8% efficacy. However, some studies assumed additional effects such as herd immunity or only took into account AOM episodes caused by serotypes included in the vaccine, which resulted in efficacy rates varying from 12% to 57%. Costs per AOM episode averted were inversely related to the assumed incidence rates of AOM and to the estimated costs per AOM episode. The median costs per AOM episode averted tended to be lower in industry-sponsored studies. Key assumptions regarding the incidence and costs of AOM episodes have major implications for the estimated cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination against AOM. Uniform methods for estimating direct and indirect costs of AOM should be agreed upon to reliably compare the cost effectiveness of available and future pneumococcal vaccines against AOM.1 maart 201	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.01.009	Effects of dispersed oil exposure on the bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and the mortality of juvenile Liza ramada	International audienceDispersing an oil slick is considered to be an effective response to offshore oil spills. However, in nearshore areas, dispersant application is a controversial countermeasure: environmental benefits are counteracted by the toxicity of dispersant use. In our study, the actual toxicity of the dispersant response technique in the nearshore area was evaluated through an experimental approach using juvenile Liza ramada. Fish were contaminated via the water column (i) by chemically dispersed oil, simulating dispersant application, (ii) by dispersant, as an internal control of chemical dispersion, (iii) by mechanically dispersed oil, simulating only the effect of natural mixing processes, without dispersant application, and (iv) by the water soluble fraction of oil, simulating the toxicity of an oil slick before recovery. Bioconcentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and mortality were evaluated, and related to both total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in seawater. Fish exposed to chemically dispersed oil showed both a higher bioconcentration of PAH and a higher mortality than fish exposed to either the water soluble fraction of oil or the mechanically dispersed oil. These results suggest that (i) dispersion is a more toxic response technique than containment and recovery of the oil slick; (ii) in turbulent mixing areas, dispersant application increases the environmental risk for aquatic organisms living in the water column. Even if the experimental aspects of this study compel us to be cautious with our conclusions, responders could consider these results to establish a framework for dispersant use in nearshore areas	['SDG03']

HCV Ab was confirmed with a recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA); RIBA-positive specimens underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for HCV. Risk behaviors associated with viremia were assessed with site-controlled ordinal regression analysis.ResultsOf 609 participants, 223 (36.6%) had confirmed HCV Ab. Of 221 with serum available for PCR evaluation, 127 (57.5%) were viremic. HCV viremia prevalence did not differ by site (range 41.7–59.1%; p=0.52). Among all IDUs, in age and site-controlled ordinal regression analysis, HCV was independently associated with HIV co-infection (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 7.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.41–11.64), prior addiction treatment (AOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.57–2.42), ever aspirating and re-injecting blood (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.18–2.23), prior incarceration (AOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.04–2.45), and sharing injecting equipment in the last 6 months (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02–1.80).ConclusionHCV viremia was present in many participants with prior HCV infection and was associated with some injecting risk behaviors, indicating a substantial risk for transmission. Current harm reduction programs should aim to improve HCV awareness and prevention among IDUs in Afghanistan as a matter of urgency	['SDG03']

10.1590/s0104-11692011000100024	Prevalence of smoking among employees of a university hospital	This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the prevalence of smoking among employees of a university hospital in Southern Brazil. Data collection happened in 2008, during the periodic health exam, using a questionnaire, according to the smoking status of the employees. The sample consisted of 1,475 subjects, in which 979 (66.4%) were non-smokers, 295 (20%) former smokers and 201 (13.6%) smokers. Smoking was more prevalent among employees with lower education levels and among professionals in administrative positions. Among smokers, low dependence was identified, as well as desire and high degree of motivation to stop smoking, with health concerns as the main reason. Thus, taking into account the motivation of smokers to stop smoking, this is an appropriate time for health education and specific support to employees in the process of smoking cessation	['SDG03']

10.1111/j.1468-1293.2010.00878.x	Pregnancy in HIV-infected teenagers in London	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe pregnancies in HIV-infected teenagers. METHODS: A review of the case notes of HIV-infected pregnant teenagers aged 13-19 years from 12 London hospitals was carried out for the period 2000-2007. RESULTS: There were 67 pregnancies in 58 young women, of whom one was known to have acquired HIV vertically. The overall mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate of HIV was 1.5% (one of 66). There were 66 live births. Median ages at HIV diagnosis and conception were 17 and 18 years, respectively. Sixty-three per cent of women were diagnosed with HIV infection through routine antenatal screening. Eighty-two per cent of pregnancies (41 of 50) were unplanned, with 65% of women (26 of 40) using no contraception. Forty-three per cent of the women (20 of 46) had a past history of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). In 63 pregnancies, antiretroviral therapy was started post-conception, with prevention of HIV MTCT the only indication in 81% of cases. Fifty-eight per cent of those on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had an undetectable HIV viral load by delivery. Eighty-seven per cent were uncomplicated pregnancies. Seventy-one per cent delivered by Caesarean section and 21% (14 of 64) had a preterm delivery (<37 weeks). In the 12 months after delivery, 45% of women received contraceptive advice and 25% of women became pregnant again. CONCLUSION: Obstetric and virological outcomes were favourable in this group of HIV-infected young women. However, the majority of pregnancies were unplanned with poor documentation of contraception use and advice and low rates of STI screening. A quarter of women conceived again within 12 months of delivery. Effective measures to reduce STIs, unplanned pregnancies and onward HIV transmission in HIV-infected teenagers are needed	['SDG03']

10.1186/1471-2458-11-357	Experience of violence and adverse reproductive health outcomes, HIV risks among mobile female sex workers in India	Abstract Background Female sex workers (FSWs) are a population sub-group most affected by the HIV epidemic in India and elsewhere. Despite research and programmatic attention to FSWs, little is known regarding sex workers' reproductive health and HIV risk in relation to their experiences of violence. This paper therefore aims to understand the linkages between violence and the reproductive health and HIV risks among a group of mobile FSWs in India. Methods Data are drawn from a cross-sectional behavioural survey conducted in 22 districts from four high HIV prevalence states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu) in India between September 2007 and July 2008. The survey sample included 5,498 FSWs who had moved to at least two different places for sex work in the past two years, and are classified as mobile FSWs in the current study. Analyses calculated the prevalence of past year experiences of violence; and adjusted logistic regression models examined the association between violence and reproductive health and HIV risks after controlling for background characteristics and program exposure. Results Approximately one-third of the total mobile FSWs (30.5%, n = 1,676) reported experiencing violence at least once in the past year; 11% reported experiencing physical violence, and 19.5% reported experiencing sexual violence. Results indicate that FSWs who had experienced any violence (physical or sexual) were significantly more likely to be vulnerable to both reproductive health and HIV risks. For example, FSWs who experienced violence were more likely than those who did not experience violence to have experienced a higher number of pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-1.6), ever experienced pregnancy loss (adjusted OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2-1.6), ever experienced forced termination of pregnancy (adjusted OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 2.0-2.7), experienced multiple forced termination of pregnancies (adjusted OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.7-2.8), and practice inconsistent condom use currently (adjusted OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.4-2.0). Among FSWs who experienced violence, those who experienced sexual violence were more likely than those who had experienced physical violence to report inconsistent condom use (adjusted OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.4-2.3), and experience STI symptoms (adjusted OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7). Conclusion The pervasiveness of violence and its association with reproductive health and HIV risk highlights that the abuse in general is an important determinant for reproductive health risks; and sexual violence is significantly associated with HIV risks among those who experienced violence. Existing community mobilization programs that have primarily focused on empowering FSWs should broaden their efforts to promote reproductive health in addition to the prevention of HIV among all FSWs, with particular emphasis on FSWs who experienced violence.</p	['SDG03']
10.1007/s13524-011-0030-7	Estimating a Dynamic Model of Sex Selection in China	Abstract                High ratios of males to females in China, which have historically concerned researchers (Sen 1990), have increased in the wake of China’s one-child policy, which began in 1979. Chinese policymakers are currently attempting to correct the imbalance in the sex ratio through initiatives that provide financial compensation to parents with daughters. Other scholars have advocated a relaxation of the one-child policy to allow more parents to have a son without engaging in sex selection. In this article, I present a model of fertility choice when parents have access to a sex-selection technology and face a mandated fertility limit. By exploiting variation in fines levied in China for unsanctioned births, I estimate the relative price of a son and daughter for mothers observed in China’s census data (1982–2000). I find that a couple’s first son is worth 1.42 years of income more than a first daughter, and the premium is highest among less-educated mothers and families engaged in agriculture. Simulations indicate that a subsidy of 1 year of income to families without a son would reduce the number of “missing girls” by 67% but impose an annual cost of 1.8% of Chinese gross domestic product (GDP). Alternatively, a three-child policy would reduce the number of “missing girls” by 56% but increase the fertility rate by 35%.</jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.lungcan.2010.10.024	Urinary isothiocyanate levels and lung cancer risk among non-smoking women: A prospective investigation	BACKGROUND: Aside from tobacco carcinogen metabolism, isothiocyanates (ITC) from cruciferous vegetables may induce apoptosis or steroid metabolism to reduce lung cancer risk. To separate the effect of these divergent mechanisms of action, we investigated the association between urinary ITC levels and lung cancer risk among non-smoking women. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control within the Shanghai Women’s Health Study. Subjects included 209 incident lung cancer cases who never used tobacco, and 787 individually matched non-smoking controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) summarizing the association between urinary ITC levels and lung cancer. Secondary analyses stratified the ITC-lung cancer analyses by menopausal status, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes. RESULTS: Urinary ITC levels were not significantly associated with lower lung cancer risk among non-smoking women, regardless of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke or menopausal status. Furthermore, this association was not modified by GSTT1 genotype. However, an inverse association was suggested among women with a GSTM1-positive genotype (Q1: OR=1.0 (reference); Q2: OR=0.35 (0.14, 0.89); Q3: OR=0.47 (0.20, 1.10); Q4: OR=0.63 (0.35, 1.54), p-trend = 0.38)). In contrast, lung cancer risk was positively associated with urinary ITC levels among women with the GSTM1-null genotype (Q1: OR=1.0 (reference); Q2: OR=1.67 (0.80, 3.50); Q3: OR=1.54 (0.71, 3.33); Q4: OR=2.22 (1.05, 4.67), p-trend = 0.06)). CONCLUSION: Urinary ITC levels were not associated overall with lower lung cancer risk among non-smoking women, but secondary analyses suggested an interaction between urinary ITC levels, GSTM1 genotype, and lung cancer risk	['SDG03']

10.1057/jphp.2011.6	A content analysis of tobacco control policy in the US Department of Defense	We conducted a content analysis of the US military tobacco policies at the Department of Defense, each respective military service (Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps), and their Major Commands (MAJCOM). Ninety-seven policies were evaluated using the Military Tobacco Policy Rating Form (MTPRF). More than three quarters addressed the following domains: (1) deleterious health effects of tobacco use; (2) environmental tobacco smoke; (3) designation of smoking areas; (4) tobacco prevention/cessation programs; and (5) smokeless tobacco. Few policies (2.1 per cent) mentioned relevant Department of Defense and respective service tobacco use prevalence statistics. Smoking as non-normative or incompatible with military service, the impact of tobacco use on military readiness, and the tobacco industry were addressed infrequently (6.2 per cent, 33.0 per cent, and 8.2 per cent, respectively). Future military tobacco policies should address important omissions of critical information such as the current service tobacco use prevalence, effects on readiness, and smoking as non-normative	['SDG03']

10.1002/hec.1763	Workplace smoking ban effects on unhappy smokers	Economists usually draw a distinction between smokers. They distinguish 'happy addicts' à la Becker-Murphy from 'unhappy addicts' who state that smoking is a mistake and call for some help to quit. When evaluating tobacco control policies, it might be important to distinguish their effects on those two types of population. Indeed, such policies are welfare improving only if they help unhappy addicts to quit. We investigate the effect of the French workplace smoking ban on a sample of presumably 'unhappy addicts', smokers who consult tobacco cessation services. We show that the ban caused an increase in the demand for such services, and that this increase was larger in cold and rainy areas. It also induced an increase in the percentage of successful attempts to quit. Workplace smoking bans might be welfare improving since they seem to help 'unhappy addicts' to reconcile their behavior with their preferences	['SDG03']
10.1111/j.1708-8305.2011.00540.x	The immunogenicity of a modified intradermal pre-exposure rabies vaccination schedule-a case series of 420 travelers	Background. Current Australian recommendations for rabies pre-exposure vaccination involve the use of cell-culture-based rabies vaccines, which are administered via intramuscular (IM) or intradermal (ID) routes. ID vaccination is more affordable for travelers, but is only recommended if there is sufficient time to perform serology 2 to 3 weeks post-vaccination and confirm immunity prior to travel. We report the immunogenicity of a modified ID schedule that can be completed in less time than the standard ID schedule, and allow more travelers to be vaccinated prior to departure. Methods. Travelers were offered a modified schedule if they were unable to afford standard IM vaccinations, and did not have time to complete a standard ID course. The modified schedule consisted of two ID injections of 0.1 mL of human diploid cell rabies vaccine administered on days 0 and 7, and serology was performed to determine immune status at a time between day 21 and 28. Results. A total of 420 travelers aged between 10 and 65 years were vaccinated using the modified ID course. The overall seroconversion rate was 94.5%, with 397 travelers developing antibody levels of >0.5 IU/mL when tested at approximately 21 days post-vaccination. Conclusion. The modified ID schedule used in this case series was highly effective, had similar immunogenicity to the standard ID schedule, and should be considered in travelers who are unable to complete standard IM or standard ID courses of rabies vaccines	['SDG03']

This systematic review distils lessons on successfully implementing congregation HIV efforts. Peer-reviewed articles on congregation-based HIV efforts were reviewed against criteria measuring the extent of collaboration, tailoring to the local context, and use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. The effectiveness of congregations’ efforts and their capacity to overcome barriers to addressing HIV is also assessed. We found that most congregational efforts focused primarily on HIV prevention, were developed in partnerships with outside organizations and tailored to target audiences, and used CBPR methods. A few more comprehensive programs also provided care and support to people with HIV and/or addressed substance use and mental health needs. We also found that congregational barriers such as HIV stigma and lack of understanding HIV’s importance were overcome using various strategies including tailoring programs to be respectful of church doctrine and campaigns to inform clergy and congregations. However, efforts to confront stigma directly were rare, suggesting a need for further research	['SDG03']

To identify contraceptive knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals involved in diabetes care. Methods The research formed part of a larger mixed methods study and included a questionnaire survey (107 women with DM) and semi-structured qualitative interviews with women with DM (n = 16) and diabetes specialists (n = 16). Analysis was by SPSS and NVivo 7. Results Two main themes emerged: Contraceptive provision and advice and Choice of contraceptive methods. There was incongruence in views between the diabetes specialists and women with DM in relation to advice and use of contraception. Many diabetes specialists felt unqualified to give advice and saw general practitioners as contraception providers. There was low use of long-acting reversible contraceptives, and women used ‘natural’ methods in their wish to ‘avoid taking hormones or chemicals’. Conclusions Despite awareness of the need to plan pregnancies to avoid poor outcomes, women with DM are likely to receive little advice about their contraceptive options. Contraception should evidently be a legitimate part of diabetes care and diabetes specialists require training to enable them to assist women in making their own informed choices	['SDG03']

10.1136/thoraxjnl-2011-200053	Cross-sectional association between smoking depictions in films and adolescent tobacco use nested in a British cohort study	OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between exposure to smoking depictions in films and adolescent tobacco use in a British population cohort. METHODS: Data on exposure to smoking in films and smoking behaviour were collected from 5166 15-year-old adolescents in the UK. Main outcome measures were smoking initiation (ever tried a cigarette) and current smoking status. Social, family and behavioural factors were adjusted for, together with alcohol use and peer smoking as potential mediators. Data from all existing cross-sectional studies examining the effects of exposure to smoking in films were summarised in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Higher exposure to smoking in films was associated with a dose-response increase in the risk of smoking initiation even after adjusting for confounders. Adolescents in the highest exposure quartile were 1.73 (95% CI 1.55 to 1.93) times (RR) more likely to initiate smoking than those in the lowest quartile. They were more likely to report current smoking after adjusting for social and familial factors (RR 1.47 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.02)), but the association attenuated after including behavioural factors (RR 1.34 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.87)). The meta-analysis shows that, after aggregation of all relevant data, viewing smoking in films increases the risk of smoking onset by over 100% (combined RR 2.13 (95% CI 1.76 to 2.57)) and the risk of current or established smoking behaviour by 68% (combined RR 1.68 (95% CI 0.40 to 2.01)). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that adolescents in the UK and elsewhere who are exposed to smoking depictions in films are more likely to initiate smoking. Given the association between smoking and poor health outcomes, these data justify a review of film ratings	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.rmed.2011.10.002	Global alliance against chronic respiratory diseases in Italy (GARD-Italy): Strategy and activities	SummaryThe steady increase in incidence of chronic respiratory disease (CRD) now constitutes a serious public health problem. CRDs are often underdiagnosed and many patients are not diagnosed until the CRD is too severe to prevent normal daily activities. The prevention of CRDs and reducing their social and individual impacts means modifying environmental and social factors and improving diagnosis and treatment. Prevention of risk factors (tobacco smoke, allergens, occupational agents, indoor/outdoor air pollution) will significantly impact on morbidity and mortality.The Italian Ministry of Health (MoH) has made respiratory disease prevention a top priority and is implementing a comprehensive strategy with policies against tobacco smoking, indoor/outdoor pollution, obesity, and communicable diseases. Presently these actions are not well coordinated. The Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD), set up by the World Health Organization, envisages national bodies; the GARD initiative in Italy, launched 11/6/2009, represents a great opportunity for the MoH.Its main objective is to promote the development of a coordinated CRD program in Italy. Effective prevention implies setting up a health policy with the support of healthcare professionals and citizen associations at national, regional, and district levels. What is required is a true inter-institutional synergy: respiratory diseases prevention cannot and should not be the responsibility of doctors alone, but must involve politicians/policymakers, as well as the media, local institutions, and schools, etc. GARD could be a significant experience and a great opportunity for Italy to share the GARD vision of a world where all people can breathe freely	['SDG03']

Another objective was to compare the medicines included in existing international lists of medicines for reproductive health. Methods: The authors calculated the average number of medicines per clinical groups included in 112 national EMLs and compared these average numbers with the number of medicines per clinical group included on the WHO/UNFPA List. Additionally, they compared the content of the lists of medicines for reproductive health developed by various international agencies. Results: In 2003, the review of the 112 EMLs highlighted that medicines for reproductive health were not consistently included. The review of the international lists identified inconsistencies in their recommendations. The reviews’ outcomes became the catalyst for collaboration among international agencies in the development of the first harmonized Interagency List of Essential Medicines for Reproductive Health. Additionally, WHO, UNFPA and PATH published guidelines to support the inclusion of essential medicines for reproductive health in national medicine policies and EMLs. The Interagency List became a key advocacy tool for countries to review their EMLs. In 2009, a UNFPA/WHO assessment on access to reproductive health medicines in six countries demonstrated that the major challenge was that the Interagency List had not been updated recently and was inconsistently used. Conclusion: The addition of cost-effective medicines for reproductive health to EMLs can result in enhanced equity in access to and cost containment of these medicines, and improve quality of care. Action is required to ensure their inclusion in national budget lines, supply chains, policies and programmatic guidance	['SDG03']

10.3141/2233-14	Costs of automobile air emissions in U.S. metropolitan areas	Automobile air emissions are a well-recognized problem and have been subject to considerable regulation. An increasing concern for greenhouse gas emissions draws additional considerations to the externalities of personal vehicle travel. This paper provides estimates of the costs for automobile air emissions for 86 U.S. metropolitan areas based on county-specific external air emission morbidity, mortality, and environmental costs. Total air emission costs in the urban areas are estimated to be $145 million/day, with Los Angeles, California, and New York City (each $23 million per day) having the highest totals. These external costs average $0.64 per day per person and $0.03 per vehicle mile traveled. Total air emission cost solely due to traffic congestion for the same 86 U.S. metropolitan areas was also estimated to be $24 million per day. These estimates are compared with others in the literature and are found to be generally consistent. These external automobile air emission costs are important for social benefit and cost assessment of transportation measures to reduce vehicle use. However, this study does not include any abatement costs associated with automobile emission controls or government investments to reduce emissions such as traffic signal setting. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1017/s0031182011001685	Regime shifts and heterogeneous trends in malaria time series from Western Kenya Highlands	SUMMARYLarge malaria epidemics in the East African highlands during the mid and late 1990s kindled a stream of research on the role that global warming might have on malaria transmission. Most of the inferences using temporal information have been derived from a malaria incidence time series from Kericho. Here, we report a detailed analysis of 5 monthly time series, between 15 and 41 years long, from West Kenya encompassing an altitudinal gradient along Lake Victoria basin. We found decreasing, but heterogeneous, malaria trends since the late 1980s at low altitudes (&lt;1600 m), and the early 2000s at high altitudes (&gt;1600 m). Regime shifts were present in 3 of the series and were synchronous in the 2 time series from high altitudes. At low altitude, regime shifts were associated with a shift from increasing to decreasing malaria transmission, as well as a decrease in variability. At higher altitudes, regime shifts reflected an increase in malaria transmission variability. The heterogeneity in malaria trends probably reflects the multitude of factors that can drive malaria transmission and highlights the need for both spatially and temporally fine-grained data to make sound inferences about the impacts of climate change and control/elimination interventions on malaria transmission.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1186/1475-2875-11-19	Changes in malaria morbidity and mortality in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa (2001- 2009): A retrospective study	BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a serious epidemic threat in Mpumalanga Province. In order to appropriately target interventions to achieve substantial reduction in the burden of malaria and ultimately eliminate the disease, there is a need to track progress of malaria control efforts by assessing the time trends and evaluating the impact of current control interventions. This study aimed to assess the changes in the burden of malaria in Mpumalanga Province during the past eight malaria seasons (2001/02 to 2008/09) and whether indoor residual spraying (IRS) and climate variability had an effect on these changes. METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study based on the analysis of secondary malaria surveillance data (cases and deaths) in Mpumalanga Province. Data were extracted from the Integrated Malaria Information System. Time series model (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) was used to assess the association between climate and malaria. RESULTS: Within the study period, a total of 35,191 cases and 164 deaths due to malaria were notified in Mpumalanga Province. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of malaria from 385 in 2001/02 to 50 cases per 100,000 population in 2008/09 (P < 0.005). The incidence and case fatality (CFR) rates for the study period were 134 cases per 100,000 and 0.54%, respectively. Mortality due to malaria was lower in infants and children (CFR < 0.5%) and higher in those >65 years, with the mean CFR of 2.1% as compared to the national target of 0.5%. A distinct seasonal transmission pattern was found to be significantly related to changes in rainfall patterns (P = 0.007). A notable decline in malaria case notification was observed following apparent scale-up of IRS coverage from 2006/07 to 2008/09 malaria seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Mpumalanga Province has achieved the goal of reducing malaria morbidity and mortality by over 70%, partly as a result of scale-up of IRS intervention in combination with other control strategies. These results highlight the need to continue with IRS together with other control strategies until interruption in local malaria transmission is completely achieved. However, the goal to eliminate malaria as a public health problem requires efforts to be directed towards the control of imported malaria cases; development of strategies to interrupt local transmission; and maintaining high quality surveillance and reporting system	['SDG03']

10.1093/ntr/ntr168	Young adults' perceptions about established and emerging tobacco products: Results from eight focus groups	Introduction:  In order to sustain their market, tobacco producers target young adults through novel product design and marketing strategies. Public health professionals need to understand young adults’ risks perceptions about and use of new tobacco products to best inform tobacco control interventions.    Methods:  In 2009, researchers conducted 8 focus groups with 67 young adults stratified by self-reported tobacco use and nonuse, residence in rural and urban areas, and living in a state with or without a statewide smoking restriction policy. Participants provided feedback about their knowledge and risk perceptions about and use of tobacco products and marketing.    Results:  Participants reported a high level of familiarity with a wide range of novel tobacco products. A great deal of confusion and disagreement appeared with regard to absolute and relative risk of different tobacco products. Participants readily discussed using smokeless tobacco products as alternatives to smoking when smoking is prohibited. Fewer differences in tobacco-related knowledge risk perceptions and use were found between urban and rural participants and those in smoke-free policy and nonpolicy states than between user and nonuser groups. Both users and nonusers were familiar with and skeptical about tobacco marketing and prevention efforts.    Conclusions:  Young adults are familiar with many tobacco products, but they convey little understanding of relative risks of new or trendy tobacco products, such as snus or hookah. Mindful of industry innovation, tobacco control advocates must continuously update prevention efforts, seeking new strategies to limit promotion, marketing, and use of new and conventional products	['SDG03']

Tobacco use is an early-onset problem behavior, but prospective studies of the effects of suspension on tobacco use are lacking. METHOD: Longitudinal school-based survey of students drawn as a 2-stage cluster sample, administered in 2002 and 2003 in Washington State, United States and Victoria, Australia. The study uses statewide representative samples of students in Grades 7 and 9 (N = 3,599). RESULTS: Rates of tobacco use were higher for Victorian than Washington State students. School suspension remained a predictor of current tobacco use at 12-month follow-up, after controlling for established risk factors including prior tobacco and other drug use for Grade 7 but not Grade 9 students. CONCLUSIONS: School suspension is associated with tobacco use in early adolescence, itself an established predictor of adverse outcomes in young people. Findings suggest the need to explore process mechanisms and alternatives to school suspensions as a response to challenging student behavior in early adolescence	['SDG03']

10.1371/journal.pone.0031563	Use of a molecular diagnostic test in AFB smear positive tuberculosis suspects greatly reduces time to detection of multidrug resistant tuberculosis	The WHO has recommended the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests to detect and help combat M/XDR tuberculosis (TB). There are limited data on the performance and impact of these tests in field settings.The performance of the commercially available Genotype MTBDRplus molecular assay was compared to conventional methods including AFB smear, culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) using both an absolute concentration method on Löwenstein-Jensen media and broth-based method using the MGIT 960 system. Sputum specimens were obtained from TB suspects in the country of Georgia who received care through the National TB Program.Among 500 AFB smear-positive sputum specimens, 458 (91.6%) had both a positive sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a valid MTBDRplus assay result. The MTBDRplus assay detected isoniazid (INH) resistance directly from the sputum specimen in 159 (89.8%) of 177 specimens and MDR-TB in 109 (95.6%) of 114 specimens compared to conventional methods. There was high agreement between the MTBDRplus assay and conventional DST results in detecting MDR-TB (kappa = 0.95, p<0.01). The most prevalent INH resistance mutation was S315T (78%) in the katG codon and the most common rifampicin resistance mutation was S531L (68%) in the rpoB codon. Among 13 specimens from TB suspects with negative sputum cultures, 7 had a positive MTBDRplus assay (3 with MDR-TB). The time to detection of MDR-TB was significantly less using the MTBDRplus assay (4.2 days) compared to the use of standard phenotypic tests (67.3 days with solid media and 21.6 days with broth-based media).Compared to conventional methods, the MTBDRplus assay had high accuracy and significantly reduced time to detection of MDR-TB in an area with high MDR-TB prevalence. The use of rapid molecular diagnostic tests for TB and drug resistance should increase the proportion of patients promptly placed on appropriate therapy	['SDG03']

10.2298/stnv1101001r	The abortion culture issue in Serbia	The problem of a large number of abortions in our country was first pointed    out as far back as 1935 at the 17th Congress of Yugoslav Physicians. The    abortion problem in Serbia is still present today, even though modern science    has provided new methods and means which are a logical solution to the    dilemma on birth control methods from the health and social aspect. Namely,    total abortion rate in Serbia was estimated at 2.76 in the year 2007. It is    very high; double the number of the total fertility rate and among the    highest in Europe and the world. The term abortion culture was first used, as    far as we know, by Henry David in the introduction of the book From Abortion    to Contraception - A Resource to Public Policies and Reproductive Behavior in    Central and Eastern Europe from 1917 to the Present in 1999, without    specifically determining it. The aim of this paper is to identify the most    important factors of the deterministic basis of endemic induced abortions in    Serbia together with indirectly estimating their connection with the    existence, namely nonexistence, of the abortion culture in our country. In    that sense, potential factors of abortion incidence in Serbia which emerge    from the social system and those connected to the individual level have been    considered. In other words, a series of laws and other legal and political    documents have been analyzed which are significant for perceiving the    abortion matter, as well as institutional frameworks for family planning,    health services, educating the youth regarding reproductive health, including    findings of numerous researches carried out among women of various age and    doctors from 1990 till present day in Serbia. The following most significant    factors for the long duration of the abortion problem have been singled out:    insufficient knowledge of modern contraception, a belief that modern    contraceptive methods are harmful to health and a number of psychological    barriers as well as those arising from relationships with partners.    Gynecological attitudes about modern contraception and behavior do not differ    significantly from the rest of the population. Additionally, there are few    organized efforts to promote sex education, as well as limitations in the    family planning programme. Distinguished macro and micro factors of    traditional birth control in Serbia confirm the existence of the abortion    culture. The nature of these factors though, indicate to the presence of the    abortion culture in our country on the political, educational, health and    individual level. The abortion culture obstructs the adoption of a modern    concept of family planning and points out to the persistence of the abortion    problem in our country in the years to come.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1177/2042098611425695	Specific features of medicines safety and pharmacovigilance in Africa	The thalidomide tragedy in the late 1950s and early 1960s served as a wakeup call and raised questions about the safety of medicinal products. The developed countries rose to the challenge putting in place systems to ensure the safety of medicines. However, this was not the case for low-resource settings because of prevailing factors inherent in them. This paper reviews some of these features and the current status of pharmacovigilance in Africa. The health systems in most of the 54 countries of Africa are essentially weak, lacking in basic infrastructure, personnel, equipment and facilities. The recent mass deployment of medicines to address diseases of public health significance in Africa poses additional challenges to the health system with notable safety concerns. Other safety issues of note include substandard and counterfeit medicines, medication errors and quality of medicinal products. The first national pharmacovigilance centres established in Africa with membership of the World Health Organization (WHO) international drug monitoring programme were in Morocco and South Africa in 1992. Of the 104 full member countries in the programme, there are now 24 African countries with a further nine countries as associate members. The pharmacovigilance systems operational in African countries are based essentially on spontaneous reporting facilitated by the introduction of the new tool Vigiflow. The individual case safety reports committed to the WHO global database (Vigibase) attest to the growth of pharmacovigilance in Africa with the number of reports rising from 2695 in 2000 to over 25,000 in 2010. There is need to engage the various identified challenges of the weak pharmacovigilance systems in the African setting and to focus efforts on how to provide resources, infrastructure and expertise. Raising the level of awareness among healthcare providers, developing training curricula for healthcare professionals, provisions for paediatric and geriatric pharmacovigilance, engaging the pharmaceutical industries as well as those for herbal remedies are of primary concern	['SDG03']
10.1111/j.1753-6405.2011.00805.x	The long-term decline of adult tobacco use in Victoria: Changes in smoking initiation and quitting over a quarter of a century of tobacco control	Abstract Objective: To examine changes in regular smoking prevalence among demographic and socioeconomic groups of Victorian adults from 1984 to 2008. Methods: Data were drawn from face‐to‐face and telephone surveys of randomly sampled Victorians conducted annually from 1984 to 2008. Results: Regular smoking in Victoria declined from 33.2% in 1984 to 15.5% in 2008, a relative decline of 53%. This change was largely accounted for by significant drops in ‘ever smoking’ among 18–29 year olds (from 59% to 35%, a relative decline of 41%) and by increased quitting among those aged 30 and older (from a quit proportion [% of those ever smoked who have quit] of 37% to 61% among 30–49 year olds, a relative increase of 64%; and from 53% to 79% among 50+ years, an increase of 48%). Over time, smoking prevalence became more similar between males and females. Regular smoking declined significantly across all socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Victorians living in low SES areas experienced the greatest relative increase in quit proportions of 75% (from 34% to 60%), helping to reduce the gap between low and higher SES groups in terms of smoking prevalence. Conclusions: Regular smoking in Victoria has declined substantially across all demographic groups. Victorians are taking up smoking at much lower levels than 25 years ago, while quit proportions have more than doubled. Implications: The continuation and extension of comprehensive, multi‐level approaches to tobacco control is likely to be required for the maintenance of the downward trend in smoking	['SDG03']

This study examined the specific contributions of victimization history and abuse-related traumagenic factors to mental health functioning and sexual risk behaviors, while considering the impact of environmental risk factors as well. Using targeted sampling strategies, we enrolled 562 Miami-based female sex workers into an intervention trial testing the relative effectiveness of two alternative case management conditions in establishing linkages with health services and reducing risk for HIV. Lifetime prevalence of abuse was extremely elevated at 88%. Nearly half reported abuse before the age of 18, while 34% reported violent encounters with “dates” or clients in the past 90 days. Serious mental illness (SMI) was quite common, with 74% reporting severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or traumatic stress. For those with histories of abuse, SMI appeared to mediate the association between abuse-related trauma and unprotected sex behaviors. Mental health treatment would appear to be an important component of effective HIV prevention among this vulnerable group, and should form part of a compendium of services offered to female sex workers	['SDG03']

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and trend of drug resistance and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection among children with culture-confirmed tuberculosis (TB). METHOD: Prospective surveillance from March 2007 to February 2009, compared to three previous surveys (1994-1998, 2003-2005, 2005-2007). Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) was performed using genotypic and phenotypic testing. If multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was detected, further DST against ethambutol (EMB) and second-line drugs was performed. RESULTS: A total of 294 children with a median age of 26 months (range 3 days-13 years) were diagnosed with culture-confirmed TB. DST results were available for 292 (99.3%); 41 (14%) were INH-resistant, including 26 (8.9%) with MDR-TB. Four children (1.4%) had RMP monoresistance. EMB resistance was present in 12/24 (50%) MDR-TB cases tested. Two isolates were resistant to ofloxacin; none had extensively drug-resistant TB. Of those tested, 29% (63/217) were HIV-infected. Any resistance to RMP increased between 1994 and 2009 (P < 0.001), as did RMP monoresistance (P = 0.009) and MDR-TB (P < 0.001). Sensitivity was 87.5% and specificity 100% for genotypic compared to phenotypic testing for INH resistance. CONCLUSIONS: RMP, and consequently multidrug, resistance is increasing among children with TB in this setting. EMB resistance is common among children with resistance to RMP and INH	['SDG03']

10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010611-134625	Addiction circuitry in the human brain	A major challenge in understanding substance-use disorders lies in uncovering why some individuals become addicted when exposed to drugs, whereas others do not. Although genetic, developmental, and environmental factors are recognized as major contributors to a person's risk of becoming addicted, the neurobiological processes that underlie this vulnerability are still poorly understood. Imaging studies suggest that individual variations in key dopamine-modulated brain circuits, including circuits involved in reward, memory, executive function, and motivation, contribute to some of the differences in addiction vulnerability. A better understanding of the main circuits affected by chronic drug use and the influence of social stressors, developmental trajectories, and genetic background on these circuits is bound to lead to a better understanding of addiction and to more effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of substance-use disorders. </jats:p	['SDG03']

The percentage of all births to unmarried women increased to 41.0% in 2009, up from 40.6% in 2008. In 2009, 32.9% of all births occurred by cesarean delivery, continuing its rise. The 2009 preterm birth rate declined for the third year in a row to 12.18%. The low-birth-weight rate was unchanged in 2009 at 8.16%. Both twin and triplet and higher order birth rates increased. The infant mortality rate was 6.42 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 2009. The rate is significantly lower than the rate of 6.61 in 2008. Linked birth and infant death data from 2007 showed that non-Hispanic black infants continued to have much higher mortality rates than non-Hispanic white and Hispanic infants. Life expectancy at birth was 78.2 years in 2009. Crude death rates for children and adolescents aged 1 to 19 years decreased by 6.5% between 2008 and 2009. Unintentional injuries and homicide, the first and second leading causes of death jointly accounted for 48.6% of all deaths to children and adolescents in 2009	['SDG03']

10.1371/journal.pone.0039672	Leptospirosis outbreak following severe flooding: A rapid assessment and mass prophylaxis campaign; Guyana, January-February 2005	BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonosis usually transmitted through contact with water or soil contaminated with urine from infected animals. Severe flooding can put individuals at greater risk for contracting leptospirosis in endemic areas. Rapid testing for the disease and large-scale interventions are necessary to identify and control infection. We describe a leptospirosis outbreak following severe flooding and a mass chemoprophylaxis campaign in Guyana. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From January-March 2005, we collected data on suspected leptospirosis hospitalizations and deaths. Laboratory testing included anti-leptospiral dot enzyme immunoassay (DST), immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and microscopic agglutination testing (MAT). DST testing was conducted for 105 (44%) of 236 patients; 52 (50%) tested positive. Four (57%) paired serum samples tested by MAT were confirmed leptospirosis. Of 34 total deaths attributed to leptospirosis, postmortem samples from 10 (83%) of 12 patients were positive by IHC. Of 201 patients interviewed, 89% reported direct contact with flood waters. A 3-week doxycycline chemoprophylaxis campaign reached over 280,000 people. CONCLUSIONS: A confirmed leptospirosis outbreak in Guyana occurred after severe flooding, resulting in a massive chemoprophylaxis campaign to try to limit morbidity and mortality	['SDG03']
10.1136/bcr.02.2012.5927	Post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm of internal carotid artery: A cause of intractable epistaxis	In this case report, the authors are presenting a case of a 35-year-old lady who presented to our clinic with recurrent episodes of massive epistaxis and loss of right eye vision for last 6 months following road traffic accident. There was no other significant medical and surgical history. Bleeding episodes were sometimes very severe with loss up to 400–500 cc and would stop spontaneously. She was given multiple blood transfusions after these episodes. A complete otorhinolaryngological examination including rigid endoscopy and coagulation investigation did not reveal any abnormality. CT with contrast of paranasal region showed blood within the right sphenoid sinus with linear fracture of the lateral wall with post-traumatic cavernous pseudoaneurysm of internal carotid artery localised to right sphenoid sinus. That was managed successfully by embolisation using a detachable balloon and a coil. She was followed up in the clinic at 6 weeks and 6 months interval with no symptoms	['SDG03']

10.1093/pcp/pcs065	Root-to-shoot translocation of alkaloids is dominantly suppressed in nicotiana alata	In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), nicotine and related pyri-dine alkaloids are produced in the root, and then trans-ported to the aerial parts where these toxic chemicals function as part of chemical defense against insect herbiv-ory. Although a few tobacco transporters have been recently reported to take up nicotine into the vacuole from the cyto-plasm or into the cytoplasm from the apoplast, it is not known how the long-range translocation of tobacco alkal-oids between organs is controlled. Nicotiana langsdorffii and N. alata are closely related species of diploid Nicotiana sec-tion Alatae, but the latter does not accumulate tobacco al-kaloids in the leaf. We show here that N. alata does synthesize alkaloids in the root, but lacks the capacity to mobilize the root-borne alkaloids to the aerial parts. Interspecific grafting experiments between N. alata and N. langsdorffii indicate that roots of N. alata are unable to translocate alkaloids to their shoot system. Interestingly, genetic studies involving interspecific hybrids between N. alata and N. langsdorffii and their self-crossed or back-crossed progeny showed that the non-translocation phenotype is dominant over the translocation phenotype. These results indicate that a mechanism to retain tobacco alkaloids within the root organ has evolved in N. alata, which may represent an interesting strategy to control the distri-bution of secondary products within a whole plant	['SDG03']

We analyse how women were named and positioned, and the attendant constructions of abortion, in South African newspaper articles on abortion from 1978 to 2005, a period during which there were radical political and legislative shifts. The name ‘woman’ was the most frequently used (70% of articles) followed by ‘girl/teenager/child’ (25%), ‘mother’ (25%), ‘patient’ (11%) and ‘minor’ (6%). The subject positionings enabled by these names were dynamic and complex and were interwoven with the localised, historical politics of abortion. The ‘innocent mother’ and the bifurcated ‘patient’ (woman/foetus) positionings were invoked in earlier epochs to promote abortion under medical conditions. The ‘dangerous mother’ and woman as ‘patient’ positionings were used more frequently under liberal abortion legislation to oppose and to advocate for abortion, respectively. The positioning of the ‘girl/teenager/child’ as dependent and vulnerable was used in contradictory ways, both to oppose abortion and to argue for a liberalisation of restrictive legislation, depending on the attendant construction of abortion. The neutral naming of ‘woman’ was, at times, linked to the liberal imaginary of ‘choice’	['SDG03']

To understand the circumstances surrounding the state’s regulatory practices’ impact on reproductive health, I recount the history of the implementation of family planning policies of the 1960s through the 1980s and interrelated social action in the country. The essay focuses on the activism of the black women’s movement during the historical period from the 1960s to the 1980s, identifying their struggles around issues of reproductive health rights. I examine the political divergences black women activists encounter with state institutions and representatives, the broader black movement, the mainstream feminist movement, and other important social and political forces. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.3188/szf.2012.0331	Forest condition in Switzerland: Assessment, development and influencing factors	Forest condition in Switzerland: assessment, development and influencing factors                In the early 1980s it was feared that air pollution would cause a widespread forest decline and a reduction in forest productivity. In Switzerland as in most European countries crown defoliation and foliage discoloration were selected as the most important indicators of forest condition. The Sanasilva inventory on a systematic network of plots showed an increase in the proportion of trees with high defoliation until 1995. Since then no trend has been detected. However, large annual fluctuations were often observed following years with large-scale climatic events, such as the storms Vivian and Lothar and the heat summer of 2003. Although highly variable, neither mortality nor removal rates have shown any time trend since 1985. The annual differences in crown defoliation, mortality and tree growth are mainly related to climatic factors. In addition to the climatic conditions, nutrient availability, soil water holding capacity and to a lesser extent air pollution determine the degree of crown defoliation at a given site and for a given species. Although several studies have found a negative effect of nitrogen deposition or ozone concentrations on tree foliation, others have shown that up to now nitrogen deposition has increased tree growth on nitrogen-limited sites. It can thus be concluded that presently air pollution does not pose a direct threat to tree conditions in Switzerland. However, the assessment of crown condition alone is not a suitable tool to detect the effects of air pollution on forests. This requires more detailed measurements on long-term research sites. However, as crown condition is strongly affected by site conditions and climate, it should be further monitored, particularly with regard to the predicted climate change.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Different molecular techniques have been used to better characterize the genetic profile of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum strains. the aim of this study was to analyse the genetic diversity of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum isolates in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceara, through the sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1-5.8S-ITS2 region, and establish the molecular profile of these isolates, along with strains from south-east Brazil, by RAPD analysis, featuring the different clusters in those regions. the isolates were grouped into two clusters. Cluster 1 included strains from the south-east and north-east regions with separation of isolates into three distinct subgroups (subgroups 1a, 1 b and 1 c). Cluster 2 included only samples from north-east Brazil. Sequencing of the ITS1 -5.8S-ITS2 region allowed the detection of two major clades, which showed geographical correlation between them and their subgroups. Therefore, it can be concluded that the H. capsulatum var. capsulatum isolates from Ceara have a high degree of genetic polymorphism. the molecular data also confirm that populations of this fungus are composed of different genotypes in Brazil and worldwide	['SDG03']

This study aims to add to the existing literature on associations between the use of antenatal (ANC) and post-natal care (PNC) and post-partum modern contraceptives. Methods Data come from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in Kenya (2008–09) and Zambia (2007). Study samples include women who had a live birth within five years before the survey (3,667 in Kenya and 3,587 in Zambia). Multivariate proportional hazard models were used to examine the associations between the intensity of ANC and PNC service use and a woman’s adoption of modern contraceptives after a recent live birth. Results Tests of exogeneity confirmed that the intensity of ANC and PNC service use and post-partum modern contraceptive practice were not influenced by common unobserved factors. Cox proportional hazard models showed significant associations between the service intensity of ANC and PNC and post-partum modern contraceptive use in both countries. This relationship is largely due to ANC services; no significant associations were observed between PNC service intensity and post-partum FP practice. Conclusions While the lack of associations between PNC and post-partum FP use may be due to the limited measure of PNC service intensity, the study highlights a window of opportunity to promote the use of modern contraceptives after childbirth through ANC service delivery. Depending on the availability of data, further research should take into account community- and facility-level factors that may influence modern contraceptive use in examining associations between ANC and PNC use and post-partum FP practice.</p	['SDG03']

10.1093/eurpub/cks032	Naturalization of immigrants and perinatal mortality	Background: Differences in neonatal mortality among immigrants have been documented in Belgium and elsewhere, and these disparities are poorly understood. Our objective was to compare perinatal mortality rates in immigrant mothers according to citizenship status. Methods: This was a population-based study using 2008 data from the Belgian birth register data pertaining to regions of Brussels and Wallonia. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for perinatal mortality according to naturalization status were calculated by logistic regression analyses adjusting for parents’ medical and social characteristics. Results: Four hundred and thirty-seven perinatal deaths were registered among 60 881 births (7.2‰). Perinatal mortality rate varied according to the origin of the mother and her naturalization status: among immigrants, non-naturalized immigrants had a higher incidence of perinatal mortality (10.3‰) than their naturalized counterparts (6.1‰) with an adjusted OR of 2.2, 95% CI (1.1–4.5). Conclusion: In a country with a high frequency of naturalization, and universal access to health care, naturalized immigrant mothers experience less perinatal mortality than their not naturalized counterparts	['SDG03']

There is a need to better define the epidemiology of injury as a basis for formulation of violence and injury prevention strategy.Methods: This is a systematic analysis of published data on the epidemiology of injuries.Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the prevalent causes of injury among adults and children, and the causes of injury mortality.Results: The medical records of 15,694 patients from the age of two weeks to 95 years formed the analysed data set. The mean value of their ages was 27 ±13 years and the gender ratio (M:F) 2:1. The injury burden is 11.2/100,000 population. The prevalent causes of injury are: (1) road traffic crashes (RTCs) = 68.4 % of 9939 patients; (2) fall = 5.5%; (3) gunshot injury = 3.2%; and (4) burns = 2.4%. Among children, the leading causes are: (1) RTC = 33.9% of 2,199 patients; (2) fall = 29.1%; (3) foreign body related = 5.5%; (4) bites = 4.9%; and (5) burns = 4%. Mortality resulted mainly from head injury, 26.6% of 575, and hemorrhage 8.3%.Conclusions: Road traffic incidents are the leading cause of injury among adults and children. Falls are six times more prevalent among children than for adults. Burns and firearm injuries are relatively uncommon. Injury mortality results mainly from head injury and hemorrhage.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1155/2012/418630	Thirty years later: Pregnancies in females perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1	The first cases of mother to child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were described more than two decades ago and since then several thousands more have been reported in western countries. In the early 1980s the majority of perinatally acquired HIV children did not survive beyond childhood. However combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) for perinatally HIV-acquired children has prolonged their survival and in the past 2 decades, many have reached adulthood. As the perinatally HIV-infected females become sexually active, they are in turn at risk for pregnancy and of transmitting HIV infection to their children. A considerable proportion of this population appears to engage in unprotected sexual intercourse leading to teenage pregnancies, STDs, and abnormal cervical cytology despite frequent contact with HIV health care providers and clinics. Currently there is a paucity of data regarding pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in HIV perinatally infected women. As increasing number of pregnancies will occur among this population we must continue to monitor and focus on their reproductive health issues to improve perinatal and long-term maternal outcomes. This paper will summarize our current knowledge about reproductive health issues and identify areas for future inquiry	['SDG03']

10.1123/ssj.29.3.325	The gap between knowing and doing: How Canadians understand physical activity as a health risk management strategy	In Canada, as in other neo-liberal states, a physically active lifestyle is discursively constructed as a moral activity, whereas a sedentary lifestyle is criticized as a failure to take charge of one’s health (Bercovitz, 2000; Lupton, 1997). This study aims to understand how Canadian men and women articulate the discursive connections between physical activity and health risks and how those connections are reflected in their reported behaviors. Analysis shows that some of the 37 men and 36 women interviewed not only “talk the talk” regarding physical activity, they also claim to lead an active lifestyle. However, “active” participants were disciplined into frequent physical activity not simply by the discursive effects of the fitness mantra promising better health, but because they enjoyed it. Conversely, the not-active-enough participants were unwilling to fully comply with the requirements of the fitness discourses because they found no pleasure in “exercise.” Despite adopting physical activity as a key strategy to manage their health risks, interviews revealed that the latter group were not docile bodies (Foucault, 1995).</jats:p	['SDG03']

The virus is classified into four genotypes (1–4) with one serotype. Genotypes 1 and 2 exclusively infect humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 also infect other animals, particularly pigs. In endemic areas, large outbreaks of acute hepatitis caused by viruses of genotype 1 or 2 frequently occur due to fecal–oral transmission, usually through contamination of drinking water. With a high attack rate in young adults (aged 15–45 years), the disease is particularly severe among pregnant women (20–30% mortality). HEV appears to be a zoonotic disease, with transmission from pigs, wild boars, and deer, or foodborne. Chronic infections are rare, except in immunosuppressed persons, such as organ transplant recipients. A subunit vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing the clinical disease, but is not yet commercially available. Our understanding of HEV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this article we review the currently available information with regard to the molecular biology, pathobiology, and epidemiology of HEV infection. We also review the current therapeutic interventions and strategies being used to control HEV infection, with emphasis on possible approaches that could be used to develop an effective vaccine against HEV	['SDG03']

10.1007/s40263-013-0040-7	Genetic influences on response to mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder: Current status of knowledge	Mood stabilizers form a cornerstone in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. The first representative of their family was lithium, still considered a prototype drug for the prevention of manic and depressive recurrences in bipolar disorder. Along with carbamazepine and valproates, lithium belongs to the first generation of mood stabilizers, which appeared in psychiatric treatment in the 1960s. Atypical antipsychotics with mood-stabilizing properties and lamotrigine, which were introduced in the mid-1990s, form the second generation of such drugs. The response of patients with bipolar disorder to mood stabilizers has different levels of magnitude. About one-third of lithium-treated patients are excellent responders, showing total prevention of the episodes, and these patients are clinically characterized by an episodic clinical course, complete remission, a bipolar family history, low psychiatric co-morbidity and a hyperthymic temperament. It has been suggested that responders to carbamazepine or lamotrigine may differ clinically from responders to lithium. The main phenotype of the response to mood stabilizers is a degree of prevention against recurrences of manic and depressive episodes during long-term treatment. The most specific scale in this respect is the so-called Alda scale, where retrospective assessment of lithium response is scored on a 0–10 scale. The vast majority of data on genetic influences on the response to mood stabilizers has been gathered in relation to lithium. The studies on the mechanisms of action of lithium and on the neurobiology of bipolar disorder have led to the identification of a number of candidate genes. The genes studied for their association with lithium response have been those connected with neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine and glutamate), second messengers (phosphatidyl inositol [PI], cyclic adenosine-monophosphate [cAMP] and protein kinase C [PKC] pathways), substances involved in neuroprotection (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and glycogen synthase kinase 3-β [GSK-3β]) and a number of other miscellaneous genes. There are no published pharmacogenomic studies of mood stabilizers other than lithium, except for one study of the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) gene in relation to the efficacy of valproate. In recent years, a number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in bipolar disorders have been performed and some of those have also focused on lithium response. They suggest roles for the glutamatergic receptor AMPA (GRIA2) gene and the amiloride-sensitive cation channel 1 neuronal (ACCN1) gene in long-term lithium response. A promise for better elucidating the genetics of lithium response has been created by the formation of the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen) to establish the largest sample, to date, for the GWAS of lithium response in bipolar disorder. The sample currently comprises more than 1,200 patients, characterized by their response to lithium treatment according to the Alda scale. Preliminary results from this international study suggest a possible involvement of the sodium bicarbonate transporter (SLC4A10) gene in lithium response. It is concluded that the pharmacogenetics of response to mood stabilizers has recently become a growing field of research, especially so far as the pharmacogenetics of the response to lithium is concerned. Clearly, the ConLiGen project is a highly significant step in this research. Although the results of pharmacogenetic studies are of significant scientific value, their possible practical implications are yet to be seen	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.etap.2013.03.007	Hair mercury level in smokers and its influence on blood pressure and lipid metabolism	OBJECT: Smoking is a major risk factor for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease and cigarettes contain a slight amount of mercury. Mercury has been causally linked to cardiovascular diseases. This study evaluated the mercury content in hair according to smoking exposure status and the influence of the mercury level on blood pressure and lipid metabolism.    METHODS: We examined mercury concentration in the hair samples from 236 healthy people 16-75-years-of-age who had visited the health promotion center of a university hospital from January 2004 to January 2007. Self-reported cigarette smoking status and baseline health information were obtained using a questionnaire. Blood pressure and serum lipid level according to the mercury concentration were assessed.    RESULTS: The mean systolic blood pressure in the smoking exposure group and non-exposure group were 123.2±15.4mmHg and 117.2±15.9mmHg, respectively (p=0.005). The mean diastolic pressure in the smoking exposure group and non-exposed group were 80.2±10.9mmHg and 75.1±11.3mmHg, respectively (p<0.001). Mercury concentration had a positive relationship with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with the normal and high mercury groups, the normal mercury group demonstrated lower blood pressure, lower triglyceride, and lower smoking amount, but higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol than the high mercury group. There was an increase of mercury concentration in the smoking exposure group. The 20-29 packyear group showed significantly increased odds ratio of mercury content, compared with the non-exposure group (14.00, 95% confidence interval, 5.03-38.96).    CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is positively associated with mercury accumulation, and high mercury concentration is associated with increased blood pressure and abnormal lipid metabolism	['SDG03']

We evaluated the prevalence of engagement in lifestyle behaviors for management of the disease, as well as the impact of healthcare professional support on these behaviors.                                               Methods                 Self-reported data were available from 2682 adult respondents, age 20 years or older, to the 2011 Survey on Living with Chronic Diseases in Canada’s diabetes component. Associations with never engaging in and not sustaining self-management behaviors (of dietary change, weight control, exercise, and smoking cessation) were evaluated using binomial regression models.                                               Results                 The prevalence of reported dietary change, weight control/loss, increased exercise and smoking cessation (among those who smoked since being diagnosed) were 89.7%, 72.1%, 69.5%, and 30.6%, respectively. Those who reported not receiving health professional advice in the previous 12 months were more likely to report never engaging in dietary change (RR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.8 – 4.2), exercise (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 – 2.1), or weight control/loss (RR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 – 3.6), but not smoking cessation (RR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.7 – 1.5). Also, living with diabetes for more than six years was associated with not sustaining dietary change, weight loss and smoking cessation.                                               Conclusion                 Health professional advice for lifestyle behaviors for type 2 diabetes self-management may support individual actions. Patients living with the disease for more than 6 years may require additional support in sustaining recommended behaviors	['SDG03']

10.1215/03616878-1966360	Health insurance coverage and use of family planning services among current and former foster youth: Implications of the health care reform law	This research uses data from a longitudinal study to examine how two provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could affect health insurance coverage among young women who have aged out of foster care. It also explores how allowing young people to remain in foster care until age twenty-one affects their health insurance coverage, use of family planning services, and information about birth control. We find that young women are more likely to have health insurance if they remain in foster care until their twenty-first birthday and that having health insurance is associated with an increase in the likelihood of receiving family planning services. Our results also suggest that many young women who would otherwise lack health insurance after aging out of foster care will be eligible for Medicaid under the health care reform law. Because having health insurance is associated with use of family planning services, this increase in Medicaid eligibility may result in fewer unintended pregnancies among this high-risk population	['SDG03']

10.1186/1475-9276-12-37	Inequality in fertility rate and modern contraceptive use among Ghanaian women from 1988-2008	Background: In most resource poor countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, modern contraceptive use and prevalence is unusually low and fertility is very high resulting in rapid population growth and high maternal mortality and morbidity. Current evidence shows slow progress in expanding the use of contraceptives by women of low socioeconomic status and insufficient financial commitment to family planning programs. We examined gaps and trends in modern contraceptive use and fertility within different socio-demographic subgroups in Ghana between 1988 and 2008. Methods: We constructed a database using the Women's Questionnaire from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008. We applied regression-based Total Attributable Fraction (TAF); we also calculated the Relative and Slope Indices of Inequality (RII and SII) to complement the TAF in our investigation. Results: Equality in use of modern contraceptives increased from 1988 to 2008. In contrast, inequality in fertility rate increased from 1988 to 2008. It was also found that rural-urban residence gap in the use of modern contraceptive methods had almost disappeared in 2008, while education and income related inequalities remained. Conclusions: One obvious observation is that the discrepancy between equality in use of contraceptives and equality in fertility must be addressed in a future revision of policies related to family planning. Otherwise this could be a major obstacle for attaining further progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5. More research into the causes of the unfortunate discrepancy is urgently needed. There still exist significant education and income related inequalities in both parameters that need appropriate action	['SDG03']

Data for Belo Horizonte were obtained from the VIGITEL system (Telephone-Based Surveillance of Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases). Alcohol use was defined as self-reported intake of at least one dose in the previous 30 days; alcohol abuse was defined as four or more doses on at least one occasion during the same period. Polytomous logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with alcohol use and abuse. Alcohol use was more prevalent among women 25 to 34 years of age. Alcohol abuse was associated with age, schooling, health status, and smoking. The results suggest the need for policies to prevent alcohol abuse among women, especially targeting those who are younger, single, smokers, and with more education.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.5888/pcd10.120204	Community-Generated recommendations regarding the urban nutrition and tobacco environments: A Photo-Elicitation study in Philadelphia	INTRODUCTION: Overweight, obesity, and tobacco use are major preventable causes of disability, disease, and death. In 2010, 25% of Philadelphia adults smoked, and 66% were overweight or obese. To address these health threats, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health launched Get Healthy Philly, an initiative to improve the city’s nutrition, physical activity, and tobacco environments. The objective of this assessment was to identify residents’ perspectives on threats to health and opportunities for change in the local food and tobacco environments. METHODS: Participants (N = 48) took photographs to document their concerns regarding Philadelphia’s food and tobacco environments and participated in photo-elicitation interviews. We coded photographs and interview transcripts and identified key themes. RESULTS: Participants proposed interventions for nutrition 4 times more often than for tobacco. Participants spontaneously articulated the need for multilevel change consistent with the ecological model of health behavior, including changes to policies (food assistance program provisions to encourage healthful purchases), local and school environments (more healthful corner store inventories and school meals), and individual knowledge and behavior (healthier food purchases). Participants often required interviewer prompting to discuss tobacco, and they suggested interventions including changes in advertising (a local environmental concern) and cigarette taxes (a policy concern). CONCLUSION: Participants were well versed in the relevance to health of nutrition and physical activity and the need for multilevel interventions. Their responses suggested community readiness for change. In contrast, participants’ more limited comments regarding tobacco suggested that prevention and control of tobacco use were perceived as less salient public health concerns	['SDG03']

10.1128/jvi.03070-12	Molecular evolution of the HIV-1 thai epidemic between the time of RV144 immunogen selection to the execution of the vaccine efficacy trial	ABSTRACT           The RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial (Thailand, 2003 to 2009), using immunogens genetically matched to the regional epidemic, demonstrated the first evidence of efficacy for an HIV-1 vaccine. Here we studied the molecular evolution of the HIV-1 epidemic from the time of immunogen selection to the execution of the efficacy trial. We studied HIV-1 genetic diversity among 390 volunteers who were deferred from enrollment in RV144 due to preexisting HIV-1 infection using a multiregion hybridization assay, full-genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. The subtype distribution was 91.7% CRF01_AE, 3.5% subtype B, 4.3% B/CRF01_AE recombinants, and 0.5% dual infections. CRF01_AE strains were 31% more diverse than the ones from the 1990s Thai epidemic. Sixty-nine percent of subtype B strains clustered with the cosmopolitan Western B strains. Ninety-three percent of B/CRF01_AE recombinants were unique; recombination breakpoint analysis showed that these strains were highly embedded within the larger network that integrates recombinants from East/Southeast Asia. Compared to Thai sequences from the early 1990s, the distance to the RV144 immunogens increased 52% to 68% for CRF01_AE Env immunogens and 12% to 29% for subtype B immunogens. Forty-three percent to 48% of CRF01_AE sequences differed from the sequence of the vaccine insert in Env variable region 2 positions 169 and 181, which were implicated in vaccine sieve effects in RV144. In conclusion, compared to the molecular picture at the early stages of vaccine development, our results show an overall increase in the genetic complexity of viruses in the Thai epidemic and in the distance to vaccine immunogens, which should be considered at the time of the analysis of the trial results.</jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1098/rstb.2012.0314	Coalescent inference for infectious disease: Meta-analysis of hepatitis C	Genetic analysis of pathogen genomes is a powerful approach to investigating the population dynamics and epidemic history of infectious diseases. However, the theoretical underpinnings of the most widely used, coalescent methods have been questioned, casting doubt on their interpretation. The aim of this study is to develop robust population genetic inference for compartmental models in epidemiology. Using a general approach based on the theory of metapopulations, we derive coalescent models under susceptible-infectious (SI), susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) dynamics. We show that exponential and logistic growth models are equivalent to SI and SIS models, respectively, when co-infection is negligible. Implementing SI, SIS and SIR models in BEAST, we conduct a meta-analysis of hepatitis C epidemics, and show that we can directly estimate the basic reproductive number (R(0)) and prevalence under SIR dynamics. We find that differences in genetic diversity between epidemics can be explained by differences in underlying epidemiology (age of the epidemic and local population density) and viral subtype. Model comparison reveals SIR dynamics in three globally restricted epidemics, but most are better fit by the simpler SI dynamics. In summary, metapopulation models provide a general and practical framework for integrating epidemiology and population genetics for the purposes of joint inference	['SDG03']

Effective interventions are of critical importance to reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with SSH. Aims: To investigate the extent and nature of research on interventions to prevent and treat SSH in young people using evidence mapping. Method: A systematic search for SSH intervention studies was conducted (participant mean age between 6-25 years). The studies were restricted to high-quality evidence in the form of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and controlled trials. Results: Thirty-eight controlled studies and six systematic reviews met the study inclusion criteria. The majority (n = 32) involved psychological interventions. Few studies (n = 9) involved treating young people with recognized mental disorders or substance abuse (n = 1) which also addressed SSH. Conclusion: The map was restricted to RCTs, CCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and thus might have neglected important information from other study designs. The effectiveness of interventions within the trials was not evaluated. The evidence base for SSH interventions in young people is not well established, which hampers best-practice efforts in this area. Promising interventions that need further research include school-based prevention programs with a skills training component, individual CBT interventions, interpersonal psychotherapy, and attachment-based family therapy. Gaps in the research exist in evaluations of interventions for SSH in young people with identifiable psychopathology, particularly substance use disorder, and research that classifies participants on the basis of their suicidal intent	['SDG03']
10.1108/jedt-08-2011-0055	Sedimentation of small and medium sized dams: Discussion issues	PurposeThere has been a general promotion of small and medium sized dams as the solution to supply water for domestic, sanitation and other livelihood purposes in the less industrialised countries of the world. This paper aims to communicate and share ideas and experiences with policy makers and other engineering practitioners in issues related to the sedimentation of, and the development of small and medium sized dams so that relevant issues are taken into account in the planning, design and implementation of such small and medium sized dams.Design/methodology/approachThis paper, which is a viewpoint, utilises the findings of various research work carried out in Zimbabwe and findings from other regional and international literature as a basis for discussion and arriving at some engineering and other developmental policy recommendations. The research work utilised and analysed in this paper is based on actual field work carried out by others as cited.FindingsThe paper concludes that the following policy and technical issues should always be borne in mind in the promotion of small and medium sized dams: the predicted increase in rainfall intensities due to climate change/variability requires the review of existing small and medium sized dam spillway capacity designs; an increase in the minimum storage ratios of small and medium sized dams should be made from the current recommended 0.1‐0.3; further research work is required to validate the postulation that rainfall intensities are increasing due to the effects of climate change/variability resulting in increased sedimentation of reservoirs; whilst sediments are required for ecosystem sustenance, they can also be viewed as a pollutant in respect of certain other human water supply needs; do not build small dams on large catchments as such small dams will silt‐up quickly and thereafter pose challenges in the management and disposal of the accumulated sediments and nutrients when decommissioning/rehabilitating them; every dam site, irrespective of the resultant dam size, should be developed to its maximum potential in respect of the dam site's water yield and/or prevailing topography; WHO predicts that road traffic injuries will rise to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. The “vulnerable road users” and/or their estates should also receive like attention and timely compensation benefits as advocated for the large dam's “disadvantaged and vulnerable” people.Originality/valueEvery year, about 1 per cent of the world's reservoir capacities are lost to sedimentation. Most researchers postulate that an increase in the intensity of rainfall due to climate change/variability is imminent and will result in increased sediment loads with resultant negative impacts on dam reservoir life‐spans and usefulness. This paper discusses the advantages, disadvantages and efficiency of small and medium sized dams in satisfying the various beneficiary needs in the less industrialised countries of the world. The technical issues that have to be considered in the design and construction of such small and medium sized dams in order to minimise the negative impacts of sedimentation in their development are also presented and discussed. The opinions and conclusions drawn in the viewpoint are those of the author.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

To describe the seroconversion rate among serodiscordant couples and to identify salient behavioral and clinical risk factors including ART that affect heterosexual HIV transmission risk among couples in rural China.    Methods Longitudinal follow-up of an open cohort of HIV serodiscordant couples took place between 2007 and 2011 in Zhumadian, a city in southern Henan province in China, where blood plasma selling in 1990s led to a regional HIV epidemic. Annual follow-up included separate face-to-face interviews of husbands and wives, and HIV antibody testing for non-index partners. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the relationship between HIV seroconversion and covariates of interest.    Results By the end of 2011, 4499 HIV serodiscordant couples had been enrolled in at least two follow-up interviews; 100 non-index partners seroconverted during the entire observation period for an incidence rate of 0.82 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.66-0.99). The incidence rates by the end of 2008, 2009, and 2010 were 2.14, 1.51, and 0.90 per 100 person-years respectively. Always using condoms in the past year of sex, gender of the index partner, frequency of sex, and ART exposure were all significant predictors of HIV seroconversion in the negative spouse. ART was highly protective against seroconversion whether the index partner was actively receiving treatment at the last follow-up (RR=0.05, 95% Cl, 0.01-0.16) or if the index partner had ever received ART (RR=0.01, 95% CI, 0.00, 0.12). The risk of seroconversion in the non-index spouse also decreased the longer the duration of the index partner&apos;s exposure to ART.    Conclusions ART exposure and always using condom were highly protective against HIV seroconversion in the negative spouse. HIV incidence in serodiscordant couples has been decreasing over time, associated with ART treatment time within 7 years in the index partner. Gender of the index spouse and frequency of sex were also important predictors. Treatment as part of a combination prevention package may be a feasible method of HIV control in this population.http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000326426800018&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=8e1609b174ce4e31116a60747a720701Medicine, General &amp; InternalSCI(E)PubMed中国科技核心期刊(ISTIC)中国科学引文数据库(CSCD)6ARTICLE193694-370012	['SDG03']
10.1186/1743-8977-10-49	Inhalation of diesel exhaust does not exacerbate cardiac hypertrophy or heart failure in two mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy	BACKGROUND: Strong associations have been observed between exposure to fine ambient particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In particular, exposure to traffic related PM(2.5) has been associated with increases in left ventricular hypertrophy, a strong risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. As much of traffic related PM(2.5) is derived from diesel exhaust (DE), we investigated the effects of chronic DE exposure on cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in the adult mouse by exposing mice to DE combined with either of two mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy: angiotensin II infusion or pressure overload induced by transverse aortic banding. METHODS: Wild type male C57BL/6 J mice were either infused with angiotensin II (800 ng/kg/min) via osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously for 1 month, or underwent transverse aortic banding (27 gauge needle 1 week for observing acute reactions, 26 gauge needle 3 months or 6 months for observing chronic reactions). Vehicle (saline) infusion or sham surgery was used as a control. Shortly after surgery, mice were transferred to our exposure facility and randomly assigned to either diesel exhaust (300 or 400 μg/m(3)) or filtered air exposures. After reaching the end of designated time points, echocardiography was performed to measure heart structure and function. Gravimetric analysis was used to measure the ventricular weight to body weight ratio. We also measured heart rate by telemetry using implanted ambulatory ECG monitors. RESULTS: Both angiotensin II and transverse aortic banding promoted cardiac hypertrophy compared to vehicle or sham controls. Transverse aortic banding for six months also promoted heart failure in addition to cardiac hypertrophy. In all cases, DE failed to exacerbate the development of hypertrophy or heart failure when compared to filtered air controls. Prolonged DE exposure also led to a decrease in average heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 6-months of DE exposure had no effect on cardiac hypertrophy and heart function induced by angiotensin II stimulation or pressure overload in adult C57BL/6 J mice. This study highlights the potential importance of particle constituents of ambient PM(2.5) to elicit cardiotoxic effects. Further investigations on particle constituents and cardiotoxicity are warranted	['SDG03']

10.1371/journal.pmed.1001534	Elimination of HIV in South Africa through Expanded Access to Antiretroviral Therapy: A Model Comparison Study	Expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) using universal test and treat (UTT) has been suggested as a strategy to eliminate HIV in South Africa within 7 y based on an influential mathematical modeling study. However, the underlying deterministic model was criticized widely, and other modeling studies did not always confirm the study's finding. The objective of our study is to better understand the implications of different model structures and assumptions, so as to arrive at the best possible predictions of the long-term impact of UTT and the possibility of elimination of HIV.We developed nine structurally different mathematical models of the South African HIV epidemic in a stepwise approach of increasing complexity and realism. The simplest model resembles the initial deterministic model, while the most comprehensive model is the stochastic microsimulation model STDSIM, which includes sexual networks and HIV stages with different degrees of infectiousness. We defined UTT as annual screening and immediate ART for all HIV-infected adults, starting at 13% in January 2012 and scaled up to 90% coverage by January 2019. All models predict elimination, yet those that capture more processes underlying the HIV transmission dynamics predict elimination at a later point in time, after 20 to 25 y. Importantly, the most comprehensive model predicts that the current strategy of ART at CD4 count ≤350 cells/µl will also lead to elimination, albeit 10 y later compared to UTT. Still, UTT remains cost-effective, as many additional life-years would be saved. The study's major limitations are that elimination was defined as incidence below 1/1,000 person-years rather than 0% prevalence, and drug resistance was not modeled.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summar	['SDG03']

Pope Benedict XVI's assertion that the distribution of condoms cannot overcome the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa and that condoms may even worsen the problem was met with widespread ridicule and condemnation. Yet, experts in HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have published scores of articles documenting condom ineffectiveness in preventing STD transmission. Even with perfect use, condoms fail. The standard of correct and consistent use has always proven to be beyond the capacity of condom users. Numerous studies have shown the tendency of individuals to take greater risks (more partners, less careful partner selection, etc.) when they think they are protected, for example, by condoms or antiretroviral drugs. Repeated exposures to STDs over time produce a cumulative risk that virtually guarantees transmission. Most HIV/AIDS experts today concur that behavioral changes (principally abstinence and monogamy), not condoms, are key to reducing incidence. </jats:p	['SDG03']

In Thailand, malaria incidence is falling whereas that of dengue is rising, with an increase in the proportion of reported severe cases. In the absence of antiviral therapeutic options for acute dengue, appropriate case management reduces mortality. However, the interruption of transmission still relies on vector control measures that are currently insufficient to curtail the cycle of epidemics. Drug resistance in malaria parasites is increasing, compromising malaria control and elimination. Deficiencies in our knowledge of vector biology and vectorial capacity also hinder public health efforts for vector control. Challenges to dengue and malaria control are discussed, and research priorities identified. © 2013	['SDG03']

This paper gives a comprehensive picture of the allocation of resources for reproductive health in Kenya and the challenges faced in the resource-tracking process. Data are drawn from Kenyan budget estimates, reproductive health accounts, and the Resource Flows Project database and compare budgets and spending in 2005–06 with 2009–10. Despite policies and programmes in place since 1994, services for family planning, maternity care and infant and child health face serious challenges. As regards health financing, the government spends less than the average in sub-Saharan Africa, while donor assistance and out-of-pocket expenditure for health are high. Donor assistance to Kenya has increased over the years, but the percentage of funds devoted to reproductive health is lower than it was in 2005. We recommend an increase in the budget and spending for reproductive health in order to achieve MDG targets on maternal mortality and universal access to reproductive health in Kenya. Safety nets for the poor are also needed to reduce the burden of spending by households. Lastly, we recommend the generation of more comprehensive reproductive health accounts on a regular basis	['SDG03']

METHODS: This was a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients (N = 130) meeting DSM-IIIR criteria for cocaine dependence and major depression or dysthymia (by SCID interview). Participants were treated with venlafaxine, up to 300 mg/day versus placebo. All patients received weekly individual manual-guided relapse prevention therapy. Weekly outcome measures included Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), self-reported cocaine use, urine toxicology and the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D). RESULTS: Mood response, defined as a 50% reduction in the Ham-D between randomization and end of study, was 41% (26/64) on venlafaxine, and 33% (22/66) on placebo (p = .39). Measures of depression (Ham-D and CGI) improved more rapidly on venlafaxine than placebo, but these differences disappeared by weeks 6–8. Cocaine outcomes did not differ between treatment groups, and the proportion of patients achieving three or more consecutive weeks of urine-confirmed abstinence was low (venlafaxine: 16%; placebo: 15%). Reduction in cocaine use was associated with mood response. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, venlafaxine was not superior to placebo on either mood or cocaine use outcomes. Mood improvement was associated with improvement in cocaine use. However, placebo mood response was only moderate, and the proportion of patients achieving sustained abstinence was low. This suggests that the subgroup of cocaine-dependent patients with depressive disorders is relatively treatment resistant, and that further research is needed to improve outcomes for these patients	['SDG03']

10.1186/1741-7015-12-3	Managing the changing burden of cancer in Asia	Asia accounts for 60% of the world population and half the global burden of cancer. The incidence of cancer cases is estimated to increase from 6.1 million in 2008 to 10.6 million in 2030, due to ageing and growing populations, lifestyle and socioeconomic changes. Striking variations in ethnicity, sociocultural practices, human development index, habits and dietary patterns are reflected in the burden and pattern of cancer in different regions. The existing and emerging cancer patterns and burden in different regions of Asia call for political recognition of cancer as an important public health problem and for balanced investments in public and professional awareness. Prevention as well as early detection of cancers leads to both better health outcomes and considerable savings in treatment costs. Cancer health services are still evolving, and require substantial investment to ensure equitable access to cancer care for all sections of the population. In this review, we discuss the changing burden of cancer in Asia, along with appropriate management strategies. Strategies should promote healthy ageing via healthy lifestyles, tobacco and alcohol control measures, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, cancer screening services, and vertical investments in strengthening cancer healthcare infrastructure to improve equitable access to services	['SDG03']

The aim of this study is to identify the most effective thermal predictor of heat-related very-elderly mortality in two cities located in different geographical contexts of central Italy. We tested the hypothesis that use of the state-of-the-art rational thermal indices, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), might provide an improvement in predicting heat-related mortality with respect to other predictors. Data regarding very elderly people (≥75 years) who died in inland and coastal cities from 2006 to 2008 (May–October) and meteorological and air pollution were obtained from the regional mortality and environmental archives. Rational (UTCI) and direct thermal indices represented by a set of bivariate/multivariate apparent temperature indices were assessed. Correlation analyses and generalized additive models were applied. The Akaike weights were used for the best model selection. Direct multivariate indices showed the highest correlations with UTCI and were also selected as the best thermal predictors of heat-related mortality for both inland and coastal cities. Conversely, the UTCI was never identified as the best thermal predictor. The use of direct multivariate indices, which also account for the extra effect of wind speed and/or solar radiation, revealed the best fitting with all-cause, very-elderly mortality attributable to heat stress.</jats:p	['SDG03']

METHODS A spatial, population case-control study in Rondonia, Brazil, based on 1,780 cases reported to the Epidemiological Surveillance System and controls based on demographic data from 1987 to 2006. The cases were grouped into five consecutive four-year periods. A generalized additive model was adjusted to the data; the dependent variable was the status of the individuals (case or control), and the independent variables were a bi-dimensional spline of the geographic coordinates and some municipality-level socioeconomic variables. The observed values of the Moran’s I test were compared to a reference distribution of values generated under conditions of spatial randomness.   RESULTS AIDS risk shows a marked spatial and temporal pattern. The disease incidence is related to socioeconomic variables at the municipal level in Rondônia, such as urbanization and human capital. The highest incidence rates of AIDS are in municipalities along the BR-364 highway and calculations of the Moran’s I test show positive spatial correlation associated with proximity of the municipality to the highway in the third and fourth periods (p = 0.05).   CONCLUSIONS Incidence of the disease is higher in municipalities of greater economic wealth and urbanization, and in those municipalities bisected by Rondônia’s main roads. The rapid development associated with the opening up of once remote regions may be accompanied by an increase in these risks to health.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Adult estuarine dwelling gastropods Nassarius burchardi and Nassarius jonasii were exposed to the synthetic estrogen 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) to determine the effects on the development and survival of their offspring. Adults were maintained in synthetic seawater controls and EE2 treatments (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 50. μg/L) over a sixteen week period. Egg capsules were collected from the adults following four, ten and sixteen weeks of adult exposure and transferred to different EE2 exposure scenarios. Treatment concentrations were selected to represent changes in EE2 exposure that could occur over different periods in an organism's lifecycle. Egg capsules laid by adults were therefore transferred to control or EE2 treatments (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, 500. μg/L) to develop until hatching. The percentage of egg capsules with unviable eggs and abnormalities, number of days for hatching to occur and hatching success were measured. The veliger larvae that hatched from egg capsules following two, eight and fourteen weeks of adult exposure to EE2 and controls were used in 96. h acute toxicity tests with controls and EE2 treatments at concentrations of 0.5, 5, 50, 500, 1250, 2500, 4000. μg/L. Exposure of adult N. burchardi and N. jonasii to EE2 affected the percentage of egg capsules with unviable eggs, the development and hatching success of embryos and survival of veligers. These toxicity tests produced a complex set of results with different responses in developing eggs and veliger larvae to the adult EE2 treatments and length of adult exposure.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This research is the focus group investigation with 33 persons participating in Balçova's Heart Project (BAK). RESULTS: The smokers have described smoking mostly as a friend but nonsmokers have described smoking as illness, unsoundness and associated with death. The smokers have indicated that the causes of cigarette smoking are a way of coping in difficulty and being accepted as friends. All of them have said that the basic factor for cessation of smoking is self-control. Smokers have signified that service for cessation of smoking should be free, continuous and applied by experts. Informational meetings should have explanations of methods of cessation of smoking, affectivity in smoking cessation process and health differences after cessation smoking. CONCLUSION: Perceptions of cigarette smokers and nonsmokers are different.

The studies based in countries where migrant women have settled highlight the need for more accurate information on FGM health consequences, in a European health care context. Excision and Handicap (ExH) is a multi-centric survey based on case–control methodology and conducted in France to assess the long-term consequences of FGM, sampling both FGM and non-FGM adult women. The interviews were conducted in 74 mother-and-child health centres and hospital departments providing gynaecological and family planning services in five French regions. The two groups were compared on health indicators (self-perceived health, illnesses, symptoms) and functioning indicators (daily, sexual and reproductive life) for cases (n = 678) and controls (n = 1706). Multivariate logistic models highlighted FGM-related health problems. Among women living in France, FGM was significantly associated with poor health indicators: gynaecological and urinary infections (OR = 2.0), sleep disorders (OR = 1.4), intense pain (OR = 1.5), difficulties in daily life (OR = 1.5) and in sexual life (OR = 1.7) or tearing during childbirth (OR = 1.6). Our results suggest that, even in a favourable healthcare context, FGM exposes women to long-term health problems, including in areas neglected in previous research. They confirm the need to establish recommendations to help physicians understand these women's needs	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.jfda.2013.09.032	Substance use disorders and HIV in Vietnam since Doi Moi (Renovation): An overview	AbstractDrawing from published and gray literature, this manuscript focuses on the following topics: (1) changing patterns of substance use and abuse in Vietnam since the early 1990s; (2) the roles of substance use in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic; (3) the responses of the Vietnamese government and other entities (both domestic and international) to substance use disorders (SUDs) and HIV; and (4) the current research capacity in Vietnam and ways in which furthering research in Vietnam could enrich our knowledge of the linkages between SUDs and HIV and of effective measures to reduce their public health consequences. A growing number of studies during the past 2 decades show dynamic and still evolving twin epidemics of SUDs and HIV in Vietnam, including a shift from consumption of opium to heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants, the concurrent use of drugs, and the increasing embrace by the government of internationally recognized effective responses (including harm reduction and methadone substitution therapy). However, remaining issues, such as the rapid ascendance of amphetamine-type stimulant use among the country's most vulnerable populations, the lack of effective integration of SUD and HIV services for HIV-infected drug users, and the reliance on international resources for maintaining quality services, among others, are posing challenges for building sustainable Vietnamese responses. Therefore, building local research and training capacity is a crucial foundation to meet these challenges	['SDG03']

10.1080/17441692.2014.890238	La situación económica: Social determinants of contraceptive use in rural Honduras	Contraceptive use is an important determinant of unintended pregnancy, but little is known about the social and structural factors that determine women’s contraceptive use in rural Honduras. In this study, we aim to characterize the individual and social determinants of contraceptive use among women in rural Honduras. In 2011 and 2012, we conducted 14 interviews and two focus groups with women 18 years and older. In our analysis, we created a family planning narrative for each participant and coded transcripts around key emergent themes related to these determinants. We found that social determinants – including poverty, gender dynamics, and availability of family planning methods – had a strong influence on contraceptive use among women in our sample. Study participants stated that they were faced with a difficult economic situation compounded by rising prices of basic goods and diminishing job opportunities. Paradoxically, at the same time that the economic situation led women to seek contraception, it also contributed to the structural barriers that limited their ability to obtain their method of choice and maintain continuous contraceptive use. Our findings suggest the need for multi-level efforts to create an enabling and sustainable environment for family planning among women in rural Honduras	['SDG03']

10.4103/0253-7176.130960	Evidence based psychosocial interventions in substance use	In recent years, there has been significant progress and expansion in the development of evidence-based psychosocial treatments for substance abuse and dependence. A literature review was undertaken using the several electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Database of systemic reviews and specific journals, which pertain to psychosocial issues in addictive disorders and guidelines on this topic). Overall psychosocial interventions have been found to be effective. Some interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, motivational interviewing and relapse prevention, appear to be effective across many drugs of abuse. Psychological treatment is more effective when prescribed with substitute prescribing than when medication or psychological treatment is used alone, particularly for opiate users. The evidence base for psychological treatment needs to be expanded and should also include research on optimal combinations of psychological therapies and any particular matching effects, if any. Psychological interventions are an essential part of the treatment regimen and efforts should be made to integrate evidence-based interventions in all substance use disorder treatment programs	['SDG03']
10.1371/journal.pone.0085646	Sexual behavior among persons living with HIV in Uganda: Implications for policy and practice	HIV epidemics are sustained and propagated by new cases of infection which result from transmission from infected persons to uninfected susceptible individuals. People living with HIV (PLHIV) play a critical role in prevention if they adopt safer sexual behaviors. This study estimated the prevalence of and factors associated with safer sexual behaviors among PLHIV seeking care from civil society organizations (CSOs).In a cross sectional study PLHIV were interviewed about their sexual practices, use of alcohol, HIV status of their regular sexual partners, desire for more children and about their socio-demographic characteristics. We calculated the proportion of PLHIV who abstained and consistently used condoms in the previous twelve months. Independent associations between safer sex and other variables were estimated using adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).Of the 939 PLHIV, 54% (508) were either abstaining or using condoms consistently and 291 (31%) desired more children. The prevalence of consistent condom use among the sexually active was 41.3% (300/731). Consistent condom use was higher among PLHIV who: didn't use alcohol (aPR 1.30, CI 1.03–1.63); were educated about re-infection with a new strain of HIV (aPR 1.84, CI 1.08–3.12) and had regular sexual partner who was HIV negative (aPR 1.29, CI 1.05–1.57). Prevalence of abstinence was 22.2% (208/939). Abstinence increased with age from 9.4% among PLHIV <25 years to 40.5% among those >50 years. Abstinence was extremely low (2.5%) among PLHIV who were married.Effective interventions that reduce alcohol consumption among PLHIV are needed to avert HIV transmission, prevent acquisition of new HIV strains and STIs. In addition, strategies are needed to address needs of PLHIV who desire more children	['SDG03']

These pregnancies are mostly unplanned and unintended and many are terminated, either legally or illegally. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the contributory role played by the knowledge, attitude and practices of female college students with respect to the utilisation of emergency contraceptives. SETTING: Three tertiary institutions in Dessie, Ethiopia. METHODS: Quantitative self-administered questionnaires were used to collect descriptive data from 352 female college students. RESULTS: The study revealed that there was a high percentage (78.3%) of unwanted pregnancies amongst those engaging in sex. Significantly, nearly half (43.3%) of these unwanted pregnancies resulted in abortion. Only 10% of the students sampled admitted to ever having used emergency contraception. Even though more than half (69.9%) of the students knew about emergency contraception, only 27% of them felt confident that they understood when it was most effective. CONCLUSION: These and other observed findings confirm the need for improvement of female college students’ knowledge and timely utilisation of emergency contraception	['SDG03']
10.4278/ajhp.121129-quan-578	Local smoke-free public policies, quitline call rate, and smoking status in kentucky	Purpose. The study investigated the relationships among local smoke-free public policies, county-level quitline call rate, and adult smoking status. Design. A retrospective cross-sectional examination of demographic characteristics, smoking status of Kentuckians, and data from the Kentucky Tobacco Quitline were used to investigate the relationship of local smoke-free ordinances or Board of Health regulations together with county-level quitline use rates and population-level adult smoking status. Setting. One hundred and four Kentucky counties. Subjects. The sample was comprised of 14,184 Kentucky participants with complete demographic information collected from the 2009–2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Measures. Individual-level demographics and smoking status from the BRFSS; county-level urban/rural status; quitline rates; and smoke-free policy status. Analysis. Given the hierarchical structure of the dataset, with BRFSS respondents nested within county, multilevel modeling was used to determine the predictors of smoking status. Results. For every 1-unit increase in the county-level call rate the likelihood of current smoking status decreased by 9%. Compared to those living in communities without a policy, those in communities with a smoke-free public policy were 18% less likely to be current smokers. Limitations include quitline call rate as the sole indicator of cessation demand, as well as the cross-sectional design. Conclusion. Communities with smoke-free policies and higher rates of quitline use have lower rates of adult smoking. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

This research examines these overlapping risk factors among 1145 pregnant Xhosa women living in 24 township neighborhoods in Cape Town, South Africa. Results revealed that 66% of pregnant women experienced at least one risk factor. In descending order of prevalence, 37% reported depressed mood; 29% were HIV+; 25% used alcohol prior to knowing that they were pregnant; and 15% had a previous childbirth with a LBW infant. Approximately 27% percent of women had more than one risk factor: depressed mood was significantly associated with alcohol use and LBW, with a trend to significance with HIV+. In addition, alcohol use was significantly related to HIV+. These results suggest the importance of intervening across multiple risks to maternal and child health, and particularly with depression and alcohol use, to positively impact multiple maternal and infant outcomes	['SDG03']

There is renewed clinical interest in long-term morbidities, including malignancies that occur disproportionately within this population. Non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the aging HIV-infected population. There is data to suggest that incidence rates are elevated among HIV-infected individuals for many cancer sites, particularly those with a confirmed or suspected infectious etiology. The complex interplay between behavioral risk factors, co-existence of viral infections, immunodeficiency and antiretroviral therapy makes it difficult to analyze why certain cancers developed more frequently in HIV-infected individuals. The challenge to clinicians caring for HIV-infected patients is to develop and implement effective means to screen, treat, and prevent NADCs in the future. This review presents data on whether NADCs are increased in the HIV-Infected population, as well as ongoing research on epidemiology, prevention and pathogenesis of this evolving aspect of the HIV epidemic	['SDG03']

To this effect, the amount of waste generated by blood donations and by blood components obtained, transfused, and incinerated between January and December 2018 was calculated based on national reports of blood banks and transfusion services. The incineration costs (expressed in US dollars) were estimated by multiplying the total biological by the price of incinerating one kilogram in three different areas of Colombia. The generated gases were determined using the emission factors of the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge of Spain. The non-generated waste was inferred from the total donations prevented by the Hemovigilance Information System (SIHEVI-INS) implemented in 2018. As a result, it was found that, in 2018, the RN recorded 858 890 blood donations and 334 503 transfused patients. Donor acceptance generated 61.0 megagrams/year of waste (73.4% were biological) with an incineration cost of $33 418 (±26 087) and emissions amounting to 25.8 megagrams of gases (99.2% CO2 and 0.6 % NO, NO2, and CO). The use and disposal of blood components generated 349.5 megagrams/year (±99.5), which is equivalent to $258 880 (±99,709) and 201.4 megagrams of gases. SIHEVI-INS avoided the production of 55.1 megagrams/year (±19.1), saving $40 805 (±18,098) and 31.8 megagrams of gases. In conclusion, the 350 megagrams of biological waste produced by the RN represented 0.06-0.08% of the total hazardous residues or waste generated in Colombia and 0.75-0.82% of the healthcare sector.El objetivo de este estudio fue cuantificar los residuos generados por la operación anual de la Red Nacional de Sangre (RN) de Colombia. Para esto, se calculó la cantidad de residuos generados por las donaciones de sangre y por los hemocomponentes obtenidos, transfundidos e incinerados entre enero y diciembre de 2018, a partir de los informes nacionales de los bancos de sangre y los servicios de transfusión. Los costos de incineración (expresados en dólares estadounidenses) se obtuvieron al multiplicar el total de residuos biológicos por el precio de incinerar un kilogramo en tres zonas distintas de Colombia. Los gases producidos se determinaron empleando los factores de emisión del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico de España. La cantidad de residuos no generados se infirió del total de donaciones prevenidas por el Sistema de Información en Hemovigilancia (SIHEVI-INS) implementado en 2018. Como resultado se obtuvo que, en 2018, la RN registró 858 890 donaciones sanguíneas y 334 503 pacientes transfundidos. La aceptación de donantes generó 61,0 megagramos/año de residuos (73.4 % biológicos) con un costo de incineración de $33 418 (±26 087) y emisión de 25,8 megagramos de gases (99,2 % CO2 y 0,6 % NO, NO2 y CO) por incineración. El uso y el descarte de hemocomponentes generaron 349.5 megagramos/año (±99.5), equivalentes a $258 880 (±99 709) y 201.4 megagramos de gases.

This study draws upon data from 51 surveys conducted between 2006 and 2013 in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean to provide an updated review of the reasons why many married women having unmet need are not practicing contraception. We examine the reasons for contraceptive nonuse and how these reasons vary across countries and according to national levels of unmet need and contraceptive use. We present specific findings regarding the most widespread reasons for nonuse, particularly infrequent sex and concerns regarding side effects or health risks. Our findings suggest that access to services that provide a range of methods from which to choose, and information and counseling to help women select and effectively use an appropriate method, can be critical in helping women having unmet need overcome obstacles to contraceptive use.

Underreporting of Natural Contraception in Urban Burkina Faso	Natural methods of contraception were widely used in developed countries until the late 1960s to space and limit childbirth. In France, when the first contraceptive surveys were conducted, researchers noticed that the use of natural methods was underreported, and questions to correct for this bias were subsequently added. The Demographic and Health Surveys do not currently include questions specific to natural methods. We added such questions to the standard DHS question regarding current contraceptive use when we conducted the Health and Demographic Surveillance System of Ouagadougou (2010 Ouaga HDSS) health survey in Burkina Faso among 758 women aged 15–49. Doing so enabled us to find a notable increase in the proportion of women in union who reported practicing contraception: 58 percent, compared with 38 percent in Ouagadougou in the 2010 Burkina Faso DHS. Thirty-two percent of women reported using modern medical methods or condoms in both surveys, but use of natural methods was much greater in the 2010 Ouaga HDSS health survey (26 percent) than in the 2010 Burkina Faso DHS (5 percent). Many women classified as having unmet need for family planning in Ouagadougou by the DHS data are in fact users of natural methods. Additional questions that would measure use of natural methods more completely should be tested in different settings	['SDG03']
10.1093/aje/kwu082	Acute myocardial infarction in Scottish military veterans: A retrospective cohort study of 57,000 veterans and 173,000 matched nonveterans	Few studies of veterans have examined cardiovascular disease as the primary outcome, other than in relation to specific conflicts or hazards. To assess the long-term risk and prognosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in United Kingdom veterans from a broad range of military backgrounds and experience, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 57,000 veterans resident in Scotland and 173,000 civilians matched on age, sex, and area of residence. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risks of fatal/nonfatal AMI overall, by sex, and by year of birth, adjusting for the potentially confounding effect of socioeconomic status, and to compare rates of case-fatality following AMI at 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year follow-up. Over a mean follow-up period of 29 years between 1981 and 2012, a total of 2,106 (3.8%) veterans experienced an AMI as compared with 5,261 (3.1%) nonveterans (hazard ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 1.29; P &#60; 0.001). There was an increased risk of AMI among veterans born in 1945–1959 but not among those born from 1960 onward. Case-fatality was lower among veterans at 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year follow-up. We conclude that health behaviors such as smoking may have increased the risk of AMI in older veterans but that younger veterans have benefited from in-service health promotion initiatives	['SDG03']

Through evolving understanding of the context of women’s lives, including the role of family planning and access to safe abortion globally in preventing the deaths and imprisonment of women, I was able to contribute to FIGO’s advocacy through a collaborative initiative with country-led action plans based on a situational analysis. Forty-six member associations rapidly agreed to participate with results of situational analyses—an unprecedented result in FIGO’s history. Professor Anibal Faúndes’ role has been pivotal to the success of this initiative, including the establishment of a working group of regional coordinators and collaborating agencies to oversee the implementation of action plans involving in-country partners and the Ministry of Health.

Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost from infections were estimated, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated relative to a no intervention alternative over 10 years of intervention. Separate analyses were performed for trainees and nontrainees, using the healthcare system perspective. Trainees face higher risk of exposure and likely received primary vaccination as infants.SettingGeneral healthcare settings.ParticipantsTrainee and nontrainee HCP.InterventionsPreexposure testing for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen followed by additional vaccination for HCP without protective antibody levels; postexposure evaluation and management for HCP reporting blood or body fluid exposuresResultsThe preexposure strategy prevents more infections and has higher costs than the postexposure strategy or no intervention. For trainees, 10-year preexposure evaluation ICERs are $832,875 and $144,457 per QALY for 95% and 68% long-term vaccine protection, respectively. Trainee 10-year postexposure evaluation ICERs are $1,146,660 and $191,579 per QALY under the 95% and 68% long-term protection assumptions, respectively. For nontrainees, 10-year ICERs are $745,739 and $1,129,286 per QALY for the preexposure and postexposure evaluation strategies, respectively.ConclusionsICERs may inform decision makers as they decide whether the added cost of the preexposure strategy provides sufficient value in preventing infections.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Bradford, UK PARTICIPANTS: 3656 Pakistani and 3503 White British women recruited to the Born in Bradford study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Socioeconomic position (employment status; level of education; receipt of benefits; housing tenure), lifestyle characteristics (body mass index (BMI) at the start of pregnancy; smoking during pregnancy) and health-related pregnancy characteristics (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; gestational diabetes; fasting glucose, postload glucose and fasting insulin at approximately 27 weeks gestation). RESULTS: Fewer Pakistani women were employed (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.19), the difference being markedly less for UK born women. UK born Pakistani women were more likely, and South Asian born less likely, to be educated post 16 than White British women. Smoking was uncommon among Pakistani women, though the difference comparing UK born Pakistani women to White British women was less than for other groups. BMI was lower among Pakistani compared to White British women (adjusted mean difference -1.12, 95% CI -1.43 to -0.81), the difference being greatest when partners were UK born irrespective of the woman's place of birth. Pakistani women had higher fasting and postload glucose (mean difference 0.20 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.24; 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.45), higher fasting insulin and were more likely to have gestational diabetes (GDM). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some socioeconomic, lifestyle and pregnancy characteristics could be beginning to change in response to migration to the UK, with generally beneficial changes, that is, improving education and employment prospects, lower BMI and no evidence that being UK born has further increased the risk of GDM, but some negative, that is, slight increases in smoking	['SDG03']

METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted on a survey cross-sectional design whose data were obtained from the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and AIDS Indicator Survey (AIS) for 7 518 young people aged 15-24 years. The analysis was performed in three stages while incorporating population survey sampling weights. Maximum likelihood-based logistic regression models were used to explore the non-spatially adjusted factors associated with HIV infection. Spatial scan statistic was used to identify geographical clusters of elevated HIV infections which justified modelling using a spatial random effects model by Bayesian-based logistic regression models. RESULTS: In this study, 309/533 HIV sero-positive female participants were selected with majority residing in the rural areas [386(72%)]. Compared to singles, those currently [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =3.64; (95% CI; 1.25-10.27)] and previously married [AOR = 5.62; (95% CI: 1.52-20.75)] participants had significantly higher likelihood of HIV infections. Sexually Transmitted Infections [AOR = 2.21; (95% CI: 1.35-3.60)] were more than twice likely associated with HIV infection. One significant (p < 0.05) primary cluster of HIV prevalence around central Uganda emerged from the SaTScan cluster analysis. Spatial analysis disclosed behavioural factors associated with greater odds of HIV infection such as; alcohol use before sexual intercourse [Posterior Odds Ratio (POR) =1.32; 95% (BCI: 1.11-1.63)]. Condom use [POR = 0.54; (95% BCI: 0.41-0.69)] and circumcision [POR = 0.66; (95% BCI: 0.45-0.99)] provided a protective effect against HIV. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed associations between high-risk sexual behaviour and HIV infection. Behavioural change interventions should therefore be pertinent to the prevention of HIV. Spatial analysis further revealed a significant HIV cluster towards the Central and Eastern areas of Uganda. We propose that interventions targeting young people should initially focus on these regions and subsequently spread out across Uganda	['SDG03']
10.1586/14787210.2014.929498	Control of Japanese encephalitis in Asia: The time is now	Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis in Asia. Recent progress in the development and availability of improved JE vaccines has revitalized the prospects for JE control. There now are a number of safe and effective vaccines, two WHO prequalified vaccines available for pediatric use, at least one vaccine considered affordable for use in lower income countries, and a GAVI Alliance commitment to provide financial support to eligible countries for campaigns for children aged 9 months through 14 years. While challenges remain, this tremendous progress means there is a better opportunity than at any time in the past to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality from this disease	['SDG03']

The aim of the present study was to assess whether the indices of CVH were discriminators of socioeconomic status (SES) in the adult population of the Republic of Srpska (RS). DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study. SETTING: RS, Bosnia and Herzegovina. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 4165 adults aged ≥18 years (mean age 50.2; 54% women) who participated in the National Health Survey performed from September to November 2010 in the RS. STUDY VARIABLES: Participant's education was a proxy for SES. Potential discriminators of SES were indices of CVH presented according to AHA as: ideal health behaviours index (non-smoking, body mass index <25 kg/m(2), physical activity at goal level and healthy diet); ideal health factors index (untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL, untreated blood pressure <120/<80 mm Hg, untreated fasting glucose <100 mg/dL and non-smoking); and ideal CVH status (defined as all seven ideal health metrics present) versus intermediate and poor CVH status. RESULTS: Participants with high educational levels had a significantly greater number of ideal CVH metrics, and ideal health factor metrics compared with those with low or medium educational level (OR 0.88 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99 and OR 0.88 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96; OR 0.81 95% CI 0.69 to 0.96 and OR 0.77 95% CI 0.68 to 0.87; respectively). The number of ideal behaviour metrics was not a discriminator of educational groups. Concerning the categories of CVH status the poor CVH was a discriminator for low and medium education compared with those with high education (OR 1.93 95% CI 1.24 to 3.01 and OR 1.54 95% CI 1.08 to 2.19, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasise the large potential for preventing cardiovascular disease, showing a low proportion with a favourable CVH profile, especially among low-educated people. It is necessary to consider prevention strategies aimed at improving CVH in RS, targeting primarily low educational groups	['SDG03']

10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2014.02.16	Survey and analysis of awareness of lung cancer prevention and control in a LDCT lung cancer screening project in Tianjin Dagang Oilfield of China	Background and objective It has been proven that increase of the awareness level of lung cancer prevention and control could enhance participation of lung cancer screening of lung cancer high risk group. The aim of this study is to investigate the awareness level of lung cancer prevention and control and the effect of individual characteristics on lung cancer awareness, and to provide evidence for comprehensive lung cancer prevention in high risk areas of lung cancer. Methods Staffs of Tianjin Dagang Oil Field who participate low dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening by cluster sampling or according to voluntary principle were surveyed, data of lung cancer awareness were collected by questionnaire. Results A total of 1,633 valid questionnaires were collected. The average age of respondents was 60.08±6.58. Most participants were males (82.2%) while female only accounted for 17.8%. The proportions of awareness about lung cancer in China, risk factors, screening methods and the knowledge of health examination were 64.5%, 77.1%, 43.7%, 49.6% respectively. Result of multiple logistic regression analysis showed that education level, smoking (pack-year), age, prior tuberculosis were the influencing factors of lung cancer awareness with adjusted Ors for education and age level as of 0.567 (95%CI: 0.439-0.733) and 1.373 (95%CI: 1.084-1.739) respectively. 80.3% of the participants can accept health examination once a year, while the ability to pay the medical expenses was not high. The influencing factors of health examination willingness were gender, age, income, the knowledge of lung cancer. Conclusion Education level and smoking affect the awareness of lung cancer prevention and control, health education for lung cancer should be conducted especially in population with low education level. Comprehensive lung cancer control in high risk areas should combined lung cancer screening, tobacco control and health education	['SDG03']
10.1289/ehp.1306858	Using forecast and observed weather data to assess performance of forecast products in identifying heat waves and estimating heat wave effects on mortality	Background: Heat wave and health warning systems are activated based on forecasts of health-threatening hot weather. Objective: We estimated heat–mortality associations based on forecast and observed weather data in Detroit, Michigan, and compared the accuracy of forecast products for predicting heat waves. Methods: We derived and compared apparent temperature (AT) and heat wave days (with heat waves defined as ≥ 2 days of daily mean AT ≥ 95th percentile of warm-season average) from weather observations and six different forecast products. We used Poisson regression with and without adjustment for ozone and/or PM(10) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm) to estimate and compare associations of daily all-cause mortality with observed and predicted AT and heat wave days. Results: The 1-day-ahead forecast of a local operational product, Revised Digital Forecast, had about half the number of false positives compared with all other forecasts. On average, controlling for heat waves, days with observed AT = 25.3°C were associated with 3.5% higher mortality (95% CI: –1.6, 8.8%) than days with AT = 8.5°C. Observed heat wave days were associated with 6.2% higher mortality (95% CI: –0.4, 13.2%) than non–heat wave days. The accuracy of predictions varied, but associations between mortality and forecast heat generally tended to overestimate heat effects, whereas associations with forecast heat waves tended to underestimate heat wave effects, relative to associations based on observed weather metrics. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that incorporating knowledge of local conditions may improve the accuracy of predictions used to activate heat wave and health warning systems.

10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.07.030	Enactment of home practice following mindfulness-based relapse prevention and its association with substance-use outcomes	Mindfulness-based treatments have received increasing interest and empirical support in the clinical psychology literature. There are, however, no studies to date that have systematically examined treatment enactment, which is the amount and type of home practice participants incorporate into their daily lives. Because treatment enactment has been cited as a key aspect of treatment fidelity (Bellg et al., 2004), this study aimed to fill this important research gap by documenting treatment enactment (i.e., home practice) in the context of a larger study of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP; Bowen et al., 2009). Participants (N = 93) in this secondary analysis had been randomized in the parent study to receive MBRP. Alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, craving, and home practice were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, 2-month and 4-month follow-up time points. Findings indicated that MBRP participants significantly increased the amount of time spent in home practice over the course of the study. Further, greater time spent in home practice was associated with less craving and AOD use at the 2- and 4-month follow-ups. Unfortunately, the significant treatment gains in home practice faded somewhat at the 2- and 4-month follow-ups. These findings suggest that MBRP clinicians should target this post-intervention decline in home practice to maximize the benefits of mindfulness meditation in decreasing AOD use and craving	['SDG03']

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-reported FS, scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort participants diagnosed with incident cancer (lung (N=303), breast (N=374), prostate (N=529), colorectal (N=228)), and cancer-free participants (N=11,155) over 15 years was examined. FS was evaluated in two ways: 1) until death or follow-up year 15 (Model 1) and 2) same as survivorship model except that a FS value of zero was used for assessments after death to follow-up year 15 (Model 2). Mean FS at discrete time points were used to generate FS trajectories. Differences in repeated measures of FS were assessed using linear growth models. RESULTS: Within one year after diagnosis, FS scores declined compared to the cancer-free group, except for prostate cancer. FS continued to decline beyond one year after lung or colorectal cancer diagnosis. FS was lower in all cancer groups, except prostate, compared to the cancer-free group (Model 1: lung -4.76, breast -2.28, colorectal -2.55; Model 2: lung -2.36, breast -2.46, colorectal -2.31). Predictors of decreased FS score independent of cancer diagnosis included low education, comorbidities, obesity, smoking, lack of health insurance, and age. CONCLUSION: FS in all incident cancer groups declined during the first year post-diagnosis, which could be due to intensive treatments. Targeting factors related to FS declines could improve health outcomes for patients with cancer	['SDG03']

METHODS: To determine specific research gaps relevant to state and community tobacco control practice, we analysed survey data collected from tobacco control programmes (TCPs) in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia (N=51). Survey items covered a range of ENDS issues: direct harm to users, harm of secondhand vapour, cessation, flavours, constituents and youth access. RESULTS: There is no ENDS topic on which a majority of state TCP managers feel very informed. They feel least informed about harms of secondhand vapour while also reporting that this information is among the most important for their programme. A majority (N=31) of respondents indicated needs for research on the implications of ENDS products for existing policies. CONCLUSIONS: TCP managers report that ENDS research is highly important for practice and need research-based information to inform decision making around the inclusion of ENDS in existing tobacco control policies. For optimal relevance to state and community TCPs, research on ENDS should prioritise study of the health effects of ENDS use and secondhand exposure to ENDS vapour in the context of existing tobacco control policies	['SDG03']

Of the 816 participants, 52% were African American, and 48% were Puerto Rican. After we obtained the conjoint trajectory groups using Mplus, we performed logistic regression analyses using SAS to compare the Bayesian Posterior Probability (BPP) of each of the conjoint trajectory groups with the BBP of the reference conjoint trajectory group to predict SUDs. Four conjoint trajectory groups were obtained. The higher BPPs of both the high depressive symptoms and low delinquent behavior trajectory group (AOR = 3.54, p<.05) and the medium depressive symptoms and high delinquent behavior trajectory group (AOR = 10.28, p<.001), as compared with the BPP of the low depressive symptoms and low delinquent behavior trajectory group, were associated with an increased likelihood of SUDs in adulthood. These associations were maintained with control on gender, ethnicity, the use of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana, socioeconomic status (SES) at age 14, and income and educational level at age 36. Prevention and treatment of delinquent individuals reporting SUDs might be more effective if their depressive symptoms were also addressed. Similarly, prevention and treatment of depressed individuals reporting SUDs might be more effective if their delinquent behavior was also addressed	['SDG03']

For the health care professionals who look after these patients, the assessment of the potential risks, and the process of guiding prospective parents through pregnancy and beyond can be both challenging and rewarding. To facilitate appropriate discussions about pregnancy, health care workers must have a detailed understanding of the various important issues that will ultimately need to be considered for any patient with cystic fibrosis considering parenthood. This review will address these issues. In particular, it will outline pregnancy outcomes for mothers with cystic fibrosis, issues that need to be taken into account when planning a pregnancy and the management of pregnancy for mothers with cystic fibrosis or mothers who have undergone organ transplantation as a result of cystic fibrosis.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Methods In 1996, a health survey was carried out in the French region of Lorraine, and all members of 8,000 randomly chosen households were followed up for mortality over a 13-year period. Mortality of subjects in relation to their employment situation at baseline was analysed using a Cox survival regression. Results In comparison with permanent workers, for unemployed men, we found age and occupation-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of 4.1 for all-causes of death and 3.9 for non-violent causes, and for male temporary workers a HR of 2.2 for both all-causes and non-violent causes of death. Bad health, tobacco smoking and alcohol misuse explained 17 % of the excess risk for the unemployed and 41 % of that for temporary workers. Conclusion The observation of large mortality inequalities across the labour market core–periphery structure has important policy implications, particularly in terms of prevention focused on unhealthy behaviours among male unemployed and temporary workers	['SDG03']

Using the viral genome sequence and collection date from 74 infections in the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Sierra Leone, we estimate key epidemiological parameters such as infectious period duration (approximately 71 hours) and date of the first case in Sierra Leone (approximately April 25(th)). We also estimate the effective reproduction number, Re, (approximately 1.26), which is the number of secondary infections effectively caused by an infected individual and accounts for public health control measures. This study illustrates that phylodynamics methods, applied during the initial phase of an outbreak on fewer and more easily attainable data, can yield similar estimates to count-based epidemiological studies	['SDG03']

10.1590/1413-81232015203.15232014	Smoking trend indicators in Brazilian capitals, 2006-2013	This study aims to analyze the trend of indicators related to smoking in the capitals of Brazil from 2006 to 2013. Information on smoking trends extracted from the survey of risk and protective factors for chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are analyzed through telephone interviews - VIGITEL conducted from 2006-2013 for the adult population in Brazilian capitals. To estimate the trend, the simple linear regression model was used. The prevalence of smokers in Brazil showed a relative reduction of 0.62% for each year of the survey, ranging from 15.6% in 2006 to 11.3% in 2013. A decrease was observed in both sexes in all age ranges except between 55 and 64 years in all education levels and regions. The total population of former smokers remained stable, with a reduction for men. Smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day decreased from 4.6% (2006) to 3.4% (2013), or 0.162 percentage points per year. Passive smoking at home decreased among women 13.4% (2009) to 10.7% (2013), a reduction of 0.72% per annum. Passive smoking at work has remained stable over the period. The smoking trend reduced in the period in most indicators, reflecting the importance of the tobacco control actions in the country.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1155/2015/815820	Living with inflammatory bowel disease: A Crohn's and Colitis Canada survey	BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in therapies for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), patient quality of life continues to be significantly impacted.OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of IBD on patients and families with regard to leisure, relationships, mental well-being and financial security, and to evaluate the quality and availability of IBD information.METHODS: An online survey was advertised on the Crohn’s and Colitis Canada website, and at gastroenterology clinics at the University of Alberta Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta) and University of Calgary Hospital (Calgary, Alberta).RESULTS: The survey was completed by 281 IBD patients and 32 family members. Among respondents with IBD, 64% reported a significant or major impact on leisure activities, 52% a significant or major impact on interpersonal relationships, 40% a significant or major impact on financial security, and 28% a significant or major impact on planning to start a family. Patient information needs emphasized understanding disease progression (84%) and extraintestinal symptoms (82%). There was a strong interest in support systems such as health care insurance (70%) and alternative therapies (66%). The most common source of information for patients was their gastroenterologist (70%); however, most (70%) patients preferred to obtain their information from the Crohn’s and Colitis Canada website.CONCLUSIONS: The impact of IBD on interpersonal relationships and leisure activities was significant among IBD patients and their families. Understanding the disease, but also alternative treatment options, was of high interest. Currently, there is a discrepancy between interest in information topics and their availability. Respondents reported a strong desire to obtain information regarding disease progression, especially extraintestinal symptoms.</jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1200/jco.2014.59.4465	Electronic nicotine delivery systems: A policy statement from the American Association for Cancer Research and the American Society of Clinical Oncology	Combustible tobacco use remains the number-one preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), which include electronic cigarettes, are devices capable of delivering nicotine in an aerosolized form. ENDS use by both adults and youth has increased rapidly, and some have advocated these products could serve as harm-reduction devices and smoking cessation aids. ENDS may be beneficial if they reduce smoking rates or prevent or reduce the known adverse health effects of smoking. However, ENDS may also be harmful, particularly to youth, if they increase the likelihood that nonsmokers or former smokers will use combustible tobacco products or if they discourage smokers from quitting. The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recognize the potential ENDS have to alter patterns of tobacco use and affect the health of the public; however, definitive data are lacking. The AACR and ASCO recommend additional research on these devices, including assessing the health impacts of ENDS, understanding patterns of ENDS use, and determining what role ENDS have in cessation. Key policy recommendations include supporting federal, state, and local regulation of ENDS; requiring manufacturers to register with the US Food and Drug Administration and report all product ingredients, requiring childproof caps on ENDS liquids, and including warning labels on products and their advertisements; prohibiting youth-oriented marketing and sales; prohibiting child-friendly ENDS flavors; and prohibiting ENDS use in places where cigarette smoking is prohibited.  This policy statement was developed by a joint writing group composed of members from the Tobacco and Cancer Subcommittee of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Science Policy and Government Affairs (SPGA) Committee and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Tobacco Cessation and Control Subcommittee of the Cancer Prevention Committee (CaPC). The statement was reviewed by both parent committees (ie, the AACR SPGA Committee and the ASCO CaPC) and was approved by the AACR Boards of Directors on August 6, 2014, and the ASCO Executive Committee on September 18, 2014.

10.1177/1757913914522785	Future initiatives to reduce lung cancer incidence in the United Kingdom: Smoking cessation, radon remediation and the impact of social change	Copyright © Royal Society for Public Health 2014. Aims:Smoking and radon cause lung cancer, with smoking being the more significant risk factor. Although programmes to identify UK houses with raised radon levels and to encourage remedial action started in 1990, uptake has been limited and those most at risk, smokers and young families, are not being reached. The risks from smoking and radon are multiplicative. Public health campaigns have reduced smoking prevalence significantly. Since most radon-induced lung cancers occur in smokers, reducing the number of smokers will reduce the number of radon-induced lung cancers. This article considers the impact of reducing smoking prevalence on the effectiveness of radon remediation programmes, combining this with demographic trends and regional variations to assess implications for future public health. Methods: Results on cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation and radon remediation programmes were combined with government figures for smoking prevalence to estimate the number of cancers averted and the cost-effectiveness of such programmes, taking into account demographic changes, including increasing life expectancy. Regional variations in smoking prevalence and smoking cessation programmes were reviewed, comparing these to the geographic variation of radon. Results: The continuing impact of smoking cessation programmes in reducing smoking prevalence will reduce the number of radon-induced lung cancers, but with a lag. Smoking cessation programmes are more cost-effective than radon remediation programmes, presenting an additional opportunity to reduce radon risk to smokers. Regional data show no correlation between smoking prevalence and radon levels. Conclusions: Reduced smoking prevalence reduces the effectiveness of radon remediation programmes. This, coupled with limited uptake of radon remediation, suggests that radon remediation programmes should be targeted, and that an integrated public health policy for smoking and radon is appropriate. Lack of correlation between smoking prevalence and radon suggests that local assessment of relative priorities for public health strategies, such as the 'Total Place' initiative, is appropriate	['SDG03']

10.5888/pcd12.140451	Unemployment and depression among emerging adults in 12 states, behavioral risk factor surveillance system, 2010	INTRODUCTION: The high rate of unemployment among emerging adults (aged 18 to 25 years) is a public health concern. The risk of depression is higher among the unemployed than among the employed, but little is known about the relationship between unemployment and mental health among emerging adults. This secondary data analysis assessed the relationship between unemployment and depression among emerging adults. METHODS: Data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were analyzed. Responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 provided data about the prevalence of depression. Bivariate relationships were assessed using χ(2) tests, and multivariable adjusted odds ratios were calculated with logistic regressions. Sociodemographic variables were sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, and education. In addition, logistic regression models adjusted for health insurance status, disability, smoking, and body mass index. The analyses were completed using SAS 9.3 survey procedures to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS: Almost 12% of emerging adults were depressed (PHQ-8 ≥10) and about 23% were unemployed. Significantly more unemployed than employed emerging adults were classified with depression. In the final model, the odds of depression were about 3 times higher for unemployed than employed emerging adults. CONCLUSION: The relationship between unemployment and depression is significant among emerging adults. With high rates of unemployment for this age group, this population may benefit from employment- and mental-health–focused interventions	['SDG03']
10.1590/0102-311x00172514	The current state of play of research on the social, political and legal dimensions of HIV	"This paper offers a critical overview of social science research presented at the 2014 International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia. In an era of major biomedical advance, the political nature of HIV remains of fundamental importance. No new development can be rolled out successfully without taking into account its social and political context, and consequences. Four main themes ran throughout the conference track on social and political research, law, policy and human rights: first, the importance of work with socially vulnerable groups, now increasingly referred to as ""key populations""; second, continued recognition that actions and programs need to be tailored locally and contextually; third, the need for an urgent response to a rapidly growing epidemic of HIV among young people; and fourth, the negative effects of the growing criminalization of minority sexualities and people living with HIV. Lack of stress on human rights and community participation is resulting in poorer policy globally. A new research agenda is needed to respond to these challenges"	['SDG03']
10.1021/es505968b	Differences between magnitudes and health impacts of BC emissions across the United States using 12 km scale seasonal source apportionment	Recent assessments have analyzed the health impacts of PM2.5 from emissions from different locations and sectors using simplified or reduced-form air quality models. Here we present an alternative approach using the adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, which provides source-receptor relationships at highly resolved sectoral, spatial, and temporal scales. While damage resulting from anthropogenic emissions of BC is strongly correlated with population and premature death, we found little correlation between damage and emission magnitude, suggesting that controls on the largest emissions may not be the most efficient means of reducing damage resulting from anthropogenic BC emissions. Rather, the best proxy for locations with damaging BC emissions is locations where premature deaths occur. Onroad diesel and nonroad vehicle emissions are the largest contributors to premature deaths attributed to exposure to BC, while onroad gasoline emissions cause the highest deaths per amount emitted. Emissions in fall and winter contribute to more premature deaths (and more per amount emitted) than emissions in spring and summer. Overall, these results show the value of the high-resolution source attribution for determining the locations, seasons, and sectors for which BC emission controls have the most effective health benefits. © 2015 American Chemical Society.LAP	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.healthpol.2014.06.008	A review of abortion laws in Western-European countries. A cross-national comparison of legal developments between 1960 and 2010	The extent to which women have had access to legal abortions has changed dramatically in Western-Europe between 1960 and 2010. In most countries, abortion laws developed from completely banning abortion to allowing its availability on request. Both the timing and the substance of the various legal developments differed dramatically between countries. Existing comparative studies on abortion laws in Western-European countries lack detail, usually focus either on first-trimester abortions or second trimester abortions, cover a limited time-span and are sometimes inconsistent with one another. Combining information from various primary and secondary sources, we show how and when the conditions for legally obtaining abortion during the entire gestation period in 20 major Western-European countries have changed between 1960 and 2010. We also construct a cross-nationally comparable classification of procedural barriers that limit abortion access. Our cross-national comparison shows that Western-Europe witnessed a general trend towards decreased restrictiveness of abortion laws. However, legal approaches to regulating abortion are highly different in detail. Abortion access remains limited, sometimes even in countries where abortion is legally available without restrictions relating to reason	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.aogh.2014.09.015	Cancer burden and control in the western pacific region: Challenges and opportunities	Background: Cancer has become a priority public health challenge in the Member States of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR). Rapid and unplanned urbanization, demographic transition, and lifestyle changes are driving the increase in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which include cancer. The WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2020, targets a reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 25% by 2025. Objectives: The aim of this study was to review the epidemiology of cancer including cancer controlefforts in the WPR. Methods: Information was primarily extracted from Globocan 2012, 'Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Vol. X', and the NCD country capacity survey carried out by the WHO in 2013. The WPR, with one-fourth of the world’s population, has one-third of all cancers globally. Cancer cases in the WPR are expected to increase from 4.5 million new cases in 2012 to 6.4 million in 2025. Findings: In most of the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia and in Pacific Island countries and areas, coverage of cancer registration is relatively low and they face many challenges in quality of cancer registry data. Eighty-five percent of LMICs have indicated the existence of a cancer control policy strategy and/or action plan. The predominance of lung, stomach, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers makes control of the disease more amenable in the WPR. A relatively high ratio of mortality to incidence in LMICs reflects health-system limitations, especially in the diagnosis and management of cancer. Conclusions: Strengthening cancer registration, tobacco control, and promotion of a healthy diet, as well as HBV and HPV vaccination, is the priority areas to reduce cancer burden. Health-system strengthening with a defined package of services at different levels, referral care, trained human resources, and appropriate technology is necessary to improve cancer management. Pain relief and palliative care are priorities as well. A well-planned national cancer control program with a strong component of surveillance and monitoring can help to reduce the cancer burden in LMICs and Pacific Island countries	['SDG03']

The overall performance of how a city is performing depends on the efficiency of different departments. Taking into account that the needed information resides in the silos of different departments, there is a need to connect the dots to see the overall picture. The operational period of the city of Rancho Cucamonga starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 4:00 PM. During that period, the city manager and other department directors need to track incidents and events happing in the city in order to respond effectively and in a timely matter. This case shows how a city has used location analytics in an innovative way to provide the capability for city management to monitor daily incidents using a single dashboard screen.</p	['SDG03']

Subjects and Methods: The particle size of smokeless tobacco forms namely mawa, gutka, khaini, and tobacco leaves was determined by image analysis and the products were subjected on an egg shell membrane subjected to artificial saliva along with constant grinding force. The processed egg shell membrane was then examined by SEM to evaluate the morphology and the degree of diffusion of these particles. Results: The morphometric image analysis revealed khaini to be smallest in size followed by mawa, gutka, and tobacco leaves. The control group (egg shell membrane not subjected to any products) under SEM demonstrated intricately woven collagen meshwork, which was regular in length, branched and anastamosed with each other. Khaini exposed membrane demonstrated maximum particle diffusion with disruption of collagen meshwork. Mawa exposed membranes demonstrated minimal particle penetration which were adherent to the collagen meshwork which was irregular with increased interfibrillar space. The egg shell membrane exposed to gutka demonstrated particle penetration at higher magnification with more or less a regular collagen meshwork. The tobacco leaf exposed egg shell membrane demonstrated minimal blebs on the meshwork surface. Conclusions: The degree of diffusion gradually increased with a decrease in the particle size establishing an inverse relationship	['SDG03']

10.3109/10408363.2014.992064	Red blood cell distribution width: A simple parameter with multiple clinical applications	The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple and inexpensive parameter, which reflects the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume (conventionally known as anisocytosis), and is traditionally used in laboratory hematology for differential diagnosis of anemias. Nonetheless, recent evidence attests that anisocytosis is commonplace in human disorders such as cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, cancer, diabetes, community-acquired pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver and kidney failure, as well as in other acute or chronic conditions. Despite some demographic and analytical issues related to the routine assessment that may impair its clinical usefulness, an increased RDW has a high negative predictive value for diagnosing a variety of disorders, but also conveys important information for short- and long-term prognosis. Even more importantly, the value of RDW is now being regarded as a strong and independent risk factor for death in the general population. Although it has not been definitely established whether an increased value of RDW is a risk factor or should only be considered an epiphenomenon of an underlying biological and metabolic imbalance, it seems reasonable to suggest that the assessment of this parameter should be broadened far beyond the differential diagnosis of anemias. An increased RDW mirrors a profound deregulation of erythrocyte homeostasis involving both impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival, which may be attributed to a variety of underlying metabolic abnormalities such as shortening of telomere length, oxidative stress, inflammation, poor nutritional status, dyslipidemia, hypertension, erythrocyte fragmentation and alteration of erythropoietin function. As such, the aim of this article is to provide general information about RDW and its routine assessment, to review the most relevant implications in health and disease and give some insights about its potential clinical applications	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.envint.2015.04.011	Housing interventions and health: Quantifying the impact of indoor particles on mortality and morbidity with disease recovery	Housing interventions for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction have the potential to reduce exposure to indoor air pollution if they are implemented correctly. This work assessed the health impacts of home energy efficiency measures in England and Wales resulting in a reduction in average indoor PM2.5 exposures of 3μgm-3. The assessment was performed using a new multistate life table model which allows transition into and between multiple morbid states, including recovery to disease-free status and relapse, with transition rates informed by age- and cause-specific disease prevalence, incidence and mortality data. Such models have not previously included disease recovery. The results demonstrate that incorporation of recovery in the model is necessary for conditions such as asthma which have high incidence in early life but likelihood of recovery in adulthood. The impact assessment of the home energy efficiency intervention showed that the reduction in PM2.5 exposure would be associated with substantial benefits for mortality and morbidity from asthma, coronary heart disease and lung cancer. The overall impact would be an increase in life expectancy of two to three months and approximately 13 million QALYs gained over the 90year follow-up period. Substantial quality-of-life benefits were also observed, with a decrease in asthma over all age groups and larger benefits due to reduced coronary heart disease and lung cancer, particularly in older age groups. The multistate model with recovery provides important additional information for assessing the impact on health of environmental policies and interventions compared with mortality-only life tables, allowing more realistic representation of diseases with substantial non-mortality burdens.</p	['SDG03']

While PSII herbicides have been shown to inhibit growth in microalgae at low concentrations, the potential impacts of chronic low concentration exposures to seagrass health and growth have not been investigated. Here we exposed two tropical seagrass species Halodule uninervis and Zostera muelleri to elevated diuron concentrations (from 0.3 to 7.2 mu g l(-1)) over a 79-day period followed by a 2-week recovery period in uncontaminated seawater. PAM fluorometry demonstrated rapid effect of diuron on photosystem II (PSII) in both seagrass species at 0.3 mu g l(-1). This effect included significant inhibition of photosynthetic efficiency (Delta F/Fm') and inactivation of PSII (F-v/F-m) over the 11 week exposure period. Significant mortality and reductions in growth was only observed at the highest exposure concentration of 7.2 mu g l(-1) diuron. However, biochemical indicators demonstrated that the health of seagrass after this prolonged exposure was significantly compromised at lower concentrations. For example, the drop in C:N ratios (0.6 mu g l(-1)) and reduced delta C-13 (1.7 mu g l(-1)) in seagrass leaves indicated reduced C-assimilation from photosynthesis. Critically, the energetic reserves of the plants (as measured by starch content in the root-rhizome complex) were approximately halved following diuron exposure at and above 1.7 mu g l(-1). During the 2-week recovery period, the photosynthetic capacity of the seagrass improved with only plants from the highest diuron treatment still exhibiting chronic damage to PSII. This study shows that, although seagrass may survive prolonged herbicide exposures, concentrations >= 0.6 mu g l(-1) diuron equivalents cause measureable impacts on energetic status that may leave the plants vulnerable to other simultaneous stressors. For example, tropical seagrasses have been heavily impacted by reduced light from coastal flood plumes and the effects on plant energetics from light limitation and diuron exposure (highest in flood plumes) are very similar, potentially leading to cumulative negative effects.

In particular, pharmaceutical opioid deaths among youth have markedly increased. One area that has received relatively little attention is the role of home safety, given that parents are an important source of opioids for youth. Parents may intentionally share opioids with youth, due to low perceived risks or limited knowledge, and youth may divert opioids from parents’ medicine cabinets. Safe medication storage has long been mandated by treatment programs that provide pharmacologically supported treatment of opioid use disorders, but it is not generally encouraged or required for pharmaceutical opioids prescribed for pain. Greater attention is needed on the development, evaluation and implementation of three preventive strategies. These three strategies can be delivered in or supported by adult medical practices: 1) fully informing adults prescribed opioids about the risks of opioids to family members and others; 2) providing locked medication safe storage devices; and 3) educating parents on safe disposal options. However, a critical evidence base is still lacking for these opioid safety interventions	['SDG03']

Here, we describe a method for the development of large recombinant BCG accession lots which stably express the lentiviral antigens, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag, using selectable leucine auxotrophic complementation. Successful establishment of vaccine stability stems from stringent quality control criteria which not only screen for highly stable complemented BCG ΔleuCDtransformants but also thoroughly characterize postproduction quality. These parameters include consistent production of correctly sized antigen, retention of sequence-pure plasmid DNA, freeze-thaw recovery, enumeration of CFU, and assessment of cellular aggregates. Importantly, these quality assurance procedures were indicative of overall vaccine stability, were predictive for successful antigen expression in subsequent passaging bothin vitroandin vivo, and correlated with induction of immune responses in murine models. This study has yielded a quality-controlled BCG ΔleuCDvaccine expressing HIV gp120 that retained stable full-length expression after 1024-fold amplificationin vitroand following 60 days of growth in mice. A second vaccine lot expressed full-length SIV Gag for &gt;1068-fold amplificationin vitroand induced potent antigen-specific T cell populations in vaccinated mice. Production of large, well-defined recombinant BCG ΔleuCDlots can allow confidence that vaccine materials for immunogenicity and protection studies are not negatively affected by instability or differences between freshly grown production batches.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Design: Cross-sectional results from a cohort study. Setting: The adult-onset asthma and exhaled nitric oxide (ADONIX) cohort, sampled during 2001-2008 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Exposure was expressed as the distance from participants' residential address to the nearest road with dense traffic (&gt;10 000 vehicles per day) or very dense traffic (&gt;30 000 vehicles per day). The exposure categories were: low (&gt;500 m; reference), medium (75-500 m) or high (&lt;75 m). Participants: The source population was a population-based cohort of adults (n=6153). The study population included 5441 participants of European descent with good quality spirometry and information about all outcomes and covariates. Outcome measures: Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were measured at a clinical examination. The association with exposure was examined using linear regression adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, smoking status and education in all participants and stratified by sex, smoking status and respiratory health status. Results: We identified a significant dose-response trend between exposure category and FEV1 (p=0.03) and borderline significant trend for FVC (p=0.06) after adjusting for covariates. High exposure was associated with lower FEV1 (-1.0%, 95% CI -2.5% to 0.5%) and lower FVC (-0.9%, 95% CI -2.2% to 0.4%). The effect appeared to be stronger in women. In highly exposed individuals with current asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, FVC was lower (-4.5%, 95% CI -8.8% to -0.1%). Conclusions: High traffic exposure at the residential address was associated with lower than predicted FEV1 and FVC lung function compared with living further away in a large general population cohort. There were particular effects on women and individuals with obstructive disease	['SDG03']

10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052254	Waterpipe industry products and marketing strategies: Analysis of an industry trade exhibition	INTRODUCTION: Understanding product development and marketing strategies of transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) has been of vital importance in developing effective tobacco control policy. However, comparatively little is known of the waterpipe tobacco industry, which TTCs have recently entered. This study aimed to gain an understanding of waterpipe tobacco products and marketing strategies by visiting a waterpipe trade exhibition. METHODS: In April 2014 the first author attended an international waterpipe trade exhibition, recording descriptions of products and collecting all marketing items available. We described the purpose and function of all products, and performed a thematic analysis of messages in marketing material. RESULTS: We classified the waterpipe products into seven categories and noted product variation within categories. Electronic waterpipe products (which mimic electronic cigarettes) rarely appeared on waterpipe tobacco marketing material, but were displayed just as widely. Claims of reduced harm, safety and quality were paramount on marketing materials, regardless of whether they were promoting waterpipe tobacco, waterpipe tobacco-substitutes, electronic waterpipes or charcoal. CONCLUSIONS: Waterpipe products are diverse in nature and are marketed as healthy and safe products. Furthermore, the development of electronic waterpipe products appear to be closely connected with the electronic cigarette industry, rather than the waterpipe tobacco manufacturers. Tobacco control policy must evolve to take account of the vast and expanding array of waterpipe products, and potentially also charcoal products developed for waterpipe smokers. We recommend tobacco-substitutes be classified as tobacco products. Continued surveillance of the waterpipe industry is warranted	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.envres.2015.07.019	Lung cancer risk of airborne particles for Italian population	Airborne particles, including both ultrafine and supermicrometric particles, contain various carcinogens. Exposure and risk-assessment studies regularly use particle mass concentration as dosimetry parameter, therefore neglecting the potential impact of ultrafine particles due to their negligible mass compared to supermicrometric particles. The main purpose of this study was the characterization of lung cancer risk due to exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and some heavy metals associated with particle inhalation by Italian non-smoking people. A risk-assessment scheme, modified from an existing risk model, was applied to estimate the cancer risk contribution from both ultrafine and supermicrometric particles. Exposure assessment was carried out on the basis of particle number distributions measured in 25 smoke-free microenvironments in Italy. The predicted lung cancer risk was then compared to the cancer incidence rate in Italy to assess the number of lung cancer cases attributed to airborne particle inhalation, which represents one of the main causes of lung cancer, apart from smoking. Ultrafine particles are associated with a much higher risk than supermicrometric particles, and the modified risk-assessment scheme provided a more accurate estimate than the conventional scheme. Great attention has to be paid to indoor microenvironments and, in particular, to cooking and eating times, which represent the major contributors to lung cancer incidence in the Italian population. The modified risk assessment scheme can serve as a tool for assessing environmental quality, as well as setting up exposure standards for particulate matter	['SDG03']

Although most of the globe's largest urban hubs fall outside this organism's regions of endemicity, clinicians practicing in a metropolis like New York City or Los Angeles must nevertheless remain vigilant for histoplasmosis because of the large immigrant population that is served by its hospitals. H. capsulatum infection ranges from asymptomatic pulmonary infection to life-threatening diffuse pneumonia with dissemination. The early years of the AIDS epidemic first introduced U.S. clinicians working in areas previously unfamiliar with histoplasmosis to newly immunocompromised patients from endemic regions presenting with disseminated H. capsulatum originally acquired in their home countries. Improvement in HIV prevention and therapeutics has reduced the frequency of such cases. Herein we report three cases of histoplasmosis encountered in our New York City institution over the last three years to emphasize that awareness of this infection remains mandatory for the frontline urban clinician	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.06.107	Implementation workshop of WHO guidelines on evaluation of malaria vaccines: Current regulatory concepts and issues related to vaccine quality, Pretoria, South Africa 07 Nov 2014	AbstractThe current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of recombinant malaria vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic and blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum were adopted by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization in 2012 to provide guidance on the quality, nonclinical and clinical aspects of recombinant malaria vaccines. A WHO workshop was organised to facilitate implementation into African (national/regional) regulatory practices, of the regulatory evaluation principles outlined in the guidelines regarding quality aspects. The workshop was used also to share knowledge and experience on regulatory topics of chemistry, manufacturing and control with a focus on vaccines through presentations and an interactive discussion using a case study approach. The basic principles and concepts of vaccine quality including consistency of production, quality control and manufacturing process were presented and discussed in the meeting. By reviewing and practicing a case study, better understanding on the relationship between consistency of production and batch release tests of an adjuvanted pre-erythrocytic recombinant malaria vaccine was reached. The case study exercise was considered very useful to understand regulatory evaluation principles of vaccines and a suggestion was made to WHO to provide such practices also through its Global Learning Opportunities for Vaccine Quality programme	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.etp.2014.10.007	Air particulate matter exacerbates lung response on Sjögren's Syndrome animals	Epidemiological studies have associated air particulate matter (PM) inhalation with a decline in lung function and increased morbo-mortality due to cardiorespiratory diseases, particularly in susceptible populations. Sjögren´s Syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by cellular infiltration in exocrine glands and extraglandular tissue, being the respiratory tract an important target. We evaluated the effect of PM on the airways of NOD mice, which develop SS and BALB/c mice. BALB/c or NOD mice (2-3 months) were randomized in two groups and exposed to intranasal instillation either with saline (control) or ROFA solution (1mg/kg body weight). After 24h, mice were euthanized in order to perform lung histology, or measure total cell number (TCN), differential cell count (DCC) and superoxide anion generation in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. BALB/c mice showed normal histoarchitecture, while NOD mice showed lymphocytic peribronchial infiltrates. ROFA exposure affected the respiratory tract from both BALB/c and NOD mice, with a significant increase in the TCN (p<0.05) and generation of O2- (p<0.05), as well as an imbalance in the DCC (p<0.05). All histological observations correlated with the cellular parameters evaluated. Lesions in NOD mice were more severe than those of BALB/c, showing cellular infiltration in the alveoli and leading to a greater decrease in the alveolar space. We have proved that in this experimental Sjögren´s Syndrome animal model (NOD mice); airborne pollution exacerbates pre-existing pulmonary lesions. These findings show experimental evidence on the harmful effects of airborne pollution on the airways of patients with Sjögren´s Syndrome.Fil: Ferraro, Sebastián Ariel.

10.3402/gha.v7.25510	Distribution of cause of death in rural Bangladesh during 2003-2010: Evidence from two rural areas within matlab health and demographic surveillance site	Objective: This study used the InterVA-4 computerised model to assign probable cause of death (CoD) to verbal autopsies (VAs) generated from two rural areas, with a difference in health service provision, within the Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance site (HDSS). This study aimed to compare CoD by gender, as well as discussing possible factors which could influence differences in the distribution of CoD between the two areas. Design: Data for this study came from the Matlab the HDSS maintained by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) since 1966. In late 1977, icddr,b divided HDSS and implemented a high-quality maternal, newborn and child health and family planning (MNCH-FP) services project in one half, called the icddr,b service area (SA), in addition to the usual public and private MNCH-FP services that serve the other half, called the government SA. HDSS field workers registered 12,144 deaths during 2003–2010, and trained interviewers obtained VA for 98.9% of them. The probabilistic model InterVA-4 probabilistic model (version 4.02) was used to derive probable CoD from VA symptoms. Cause-specific mortality rates and fractions were compared across gender and areas. Appropriate statistical tests were applied for significance testing. Results: Mortality rates due to neonatal causes and communicable diseases (CDs) were lower in the icddr,b SA than in the government SA, where mortality rates due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were lower. Cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs) due to CDs (23.2% versus 18.8%) and neonatal causes (7.4% versus 6%) were higher in the government SA, whereas CSMFs due to NCDs were higher (58.2% versus 50.7%) in the icddr,b SA. The rank-order of CSMFs by age group showed marked variations, the largest category being acute respiratory infection/pneumonia in infancy, injury in 1–4 and 5–14 years, neoplasms in 15–49 and 50–64 years, and stroke in 65+ years. Conclusions: Automated InterVA-4 coding of VA to determine probable CoD revealed the difference in the structure of CoD between areas with prominence of NCDs in both areas. Such information can help local planning of health services for prevention and management of disease burden	['SDG03']

10.1037/adb0000056	Randomized controlled trial of brief alcohol screening and intervention for college students for heavy-drinking mandated and volunteer undergraduates: 12-month outcomes	This is the first randomized trial testing whether heavy-drinking undergraduates mandated to the Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) program following a campus alcohol violation would benefit as much as heavy-drinking volunteers up to 1 year postintervention using control groups with high-risk drinkers to model disciplinary-related and naturalistic changes in drinking. Participants (61% male; 51% mandated; 84% Caucasian; M age = 20.14 years) were screened for heavy drinking and randomized to BASICS (n = 115) or assessment-only control (n = 110). Outcome measures (drinking, alcohol problems) were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention. At 4 weeks postintervention, intent-to-treat multilevel longitudinal models showed that regardless of referral group (mandated or volunteer), BASICS significantly decreased weekly drinking, typical drinks, and peak drinks relative to controls (ds = .41-.92). BASICS had a large effect on decreases in alcohol problems (d = .87). At 12 months postintervention, BASICS participants (regardless of referral group) reported significantly fewer alcohol problems (d = .56) compared with controls. Significant long-term intervention gains for peak and typical drinks were sustained in both referral groups relative to controls (ds = .42; .11). Referral group had no significant main effect and did not interact with intervention condition to predict outcomes. Given that BASICS was associated with less drinking and fewer alcohol problems (even among heavier drinking mandated students up to 1 year postintervention), provision of BASICS-style programs within disciplinary settings may help reduce heavy and problematic drinking among at-risk students.

There is mounting concern over corresponding rising unemployment and depleting per capita income. The purpose of this paper is to examine the issues from a long-run perspective by assessing the relationships between population growth and a plethora of investment dynamics: public, private, foreign and domestic investments.

Findings                 – In the long-run population growth will: first, decrease foreign and public investments in Ivory Coast; second, increase public and private investments in Swaziland; three, deplete public investment but augment domestic investment in Zambia; fourth diminish private investment and improve domestic investment in the Congo Republic and Sudan, respectively.                                           Practical implications                 – Mainstream positive linkage of population growth to investment growth in the long-term should be treated with extreme caution. Policy orientation should not be blanket, but contingent on country-specific trends and tailored differently across countries. The findings stress the need for the creation of a conducive investment climate (and ease of doing business) for private and foreign investments. Family planning and birth control policies could also be considered in countries with little future investment avenues.

10.1186/s12889-015-2215-2	Early motherhood: A qualitative study exploring the experiences of African Australian teenage mothers in greater Melbourne, Australia	BACKGROUND: Motherhood is a significant and important aspect of life for many women around the globe. For women in communities where motherhood is highly desired, motherhood is considered crucial to the woman’s identity. Teenage motherhood, occurring at a critical developmental stage of teenagers’ lives, has been identified as having adverse social and health consequences. This research aimed to solicit the lived experiences of African Australian young refugee women who have experienced early motherhood in Australia. METHODS: This qualitative research used in-depth interviews. The research methods and analysis were informed by intersectionality theory, phenomenology and a cultural competency framework. Sixteen African born refugee young women who had experienced teenage pregnancy and early motherhood in Greater Melbourne, Australia took part in this research. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and data analysed using thematic content analysis. Ethics approval for this research was granted by Victoria University Human Research Ethics committee. RESULTS: Motherhood brings increased responsibilities, social recognition, and a sense of purpose for young mothers. Despite the positive aspects of motherhood, participants faced challenges that affected their lives. Most often, the challenges included coping with increased responsibilities following the birth of the baby, managing the competing demands of schooling, work and taking care of a baby in a site of settlement. The young mothers indicated they received good support from their mothers, siblings and close friends, but rarely from the father of their baby and the wider community. Participants felt that teenage mothers are frowned upon by their wider ethnic communities, which left them with feelings of shame and embarrassment, despite the personal perceived benefits of achieving motherhood. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that service providers and policy makers support the role of the young mothers’ own mother, sisters, their grandmothers and aunts following early motherhood. Such support from significant females will help facilitate young mothers’ re-engagement with education, work and other aspects of life. For young migrant mothers, this is particularly important in order to facilitate settlement in a new country and reduce the risk of subsequent mistimed pregnancies. Service providers need to expand their knowledge and awareness of the specific needs of refugee teen mothers living in ‘new settings’	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.pmedr.2015.08.018	Examination of community and consumer nutrition, tobacco and physical activity environments at food and tobacco retail stores in three diverse North Carolina communities	AbstractTo advance our understanding of multiple health-related dimensions of the built environment, this study examined associations among nutrition, tobacco, and physical activity community and consumer environments. Community environment measures included supermarket access, tobacco outlet density, and physical activity resource density in store neighborhoods. Cross-sectional observations of the nutrition, tobacco and physical activity environments were conducted in 2011 at and around 303 food stores that sold tobacco products in three North Carolina counties. Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression were used to examine associations between community and consumer environments. Correlations between community nutrition, tobacco, and physical activity environments ranged from slight to fair (−0.35 to 0.20) and from poor to fair (−0.01 to −0.38) between consumer environments. Significant relationships between consumer tobacco and nutrition environments were found after controlling for store and neighborhood characteristics. For example, stores with higher amounts of interior tobacco marketing had higher healthy food availability (p=0.001), while stores with higher amounts of exterior tobacco marketing had lower healthy food availability (p=0.02). Community and consumer environments for nutrition, tobacco, and physical activity were interrelated. Measures that assess single aspects of community or consumer environments could miss characteristics that may influence customer purchasing. Even chain supermarkets, typically regarded as healthful food sources compared to smaller food stores, may expose customers to tobacco marketing inside. Future research could explore combining efforts to reduce obesity and tobacco use by addressing tobacco marketing, healthy food availability and physical activity opportunities at retail food outlets	['SDG03']
10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052294	Beyond excise taxes: A systematic review of literature on non-tax policy approaches to raising tobacco product prices	OBJECTIVE: Raising the price of tobacco products is considered one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco use. In addition to excise taxes, governments are exploring other policies to raise tobacco prices and minimise price dispersion, both within and across price tiers. We conducted a systematic review to determine how these policies are described, recommended and evaluated in the literature. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched six databases and the California Tobacco Control library for English language studies or reports, indexed on or before 18 December 2013, that included a tobacco keyword (eg, cigarette), policy keyword (eg, legislation) and a price keyword (eg, promotion). We identified 3067 abstracts. STUDY SELECTION: Two coders independently reviewed all abstracts and identified 56 studies or reports that explicitly described a public policy likely to impact the retail price of tobacco products through non-tax means. DATA EXTRACTION: Two coders independently identified tobacco products targeted by policies described, recommendations for implementing policies and empirical assessments of policy impacts. DATA SYNTHESIS: The most prevalent non-tax price policies were price promotion restrictions and minimum price laws. Few studies measured the impact of non-tax policies on average prices, price dispersion or disparities in tobacco consumption, but the literature includes suggestions for crafting policies and preparing for legal challenges or tobacco industry opposition. CONCLUSIONS: Price-focused evaluations of well-implemented non-tax price policies are needed to determine whether they can deliver on their promise to raise prices, reduce price dispersion and serve as an important complement to excise taxes	['SDG03']

10.1371/journal.pone.0135179	A century of tuberculosis epidemiology in the northern and southern hemisphere: The differential impact of control interventions	Cape Town has one of the highest TB burdens of any city in the world. In 1900 the City of Cape Town, New York City and London had high mortality of tuberculosis (TB). Throughout the 20th century contemporaneous public health measures including screening, diagnosis and treatment were implemented in all three settings. Mandatory notification of TB and vital status enabled comparison of disease burden trajectories.TB mortality, notification and case fatality rates were calculated from 1912 to 2012 using annual TB notifications, TB death certifications and population estimates. Notification rates were stratified by age and in Cape Town by HIV status (from 2009 onwards).Pre-chemotherapy, TB mortality and notification rates declined steadily in New York and London but remained high in Cape Town. Following introduction of combination chemotherapy, mean annual case fatality dropped from 45–60% to below 10% in all three settings. Mortality and notification rates subsequently declined, although Cape Town notifications did not decline as far as those in New York or London and returned to pre-chemotherapy levels by 1980. The proportional contribution of childhood TB diminished in New York and London but remained high in Cape Town. The advent of the Cape Town HIV-epidemic in the 1990s was associated with a further two-fold increase in incidence. In 2012, notification rates among HIV-negatives remained at pre-chemotherapy levels.TB control was achieved in New York and London but failed in Cape Town. The TB disease burden trajectories started diverging before the availability of combination chemotherapy in 1952 and further diverged following the HIV epidemic in 1990. Chemotherapy impacted case fatality but not transmission, evidenced by on-going high childhood TB rates. Currently endemic TB results from high on-going transmission, which has been exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. TB control will require reducing transmission, which is inexorably linked to prevailing socio-economic factors	['SDG03']

10.3402/ejpt.v5.24402	Early psychological intervention in accidentally injured children ages 2-16: A randomized controlled trial	BACKGROUND: Road traffic accidents (RTA) and burns are frequent events in children. Although many children recover spontaneously, a considerable number develop long-term psychological sequelae. Evidence on early psychological interventions to prevent such long-term problems is still scarce for school-age children and completely lacking for pre-school children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of an early two-session cognitive-behavioral intervention in 108 children ages 2–16 after RTAs and burns. METHODS: Children assessed at risk for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were randomly assigned to either a control group offered treatment as usual or an intervention group. Primary outcomes were PTSD, behavioral problems, and depression symptoms. Baseline and blinded 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments were conducted. RESULTS: In pre-school children, no intervention effects were found. School-age children in the intervention group exhibited significantly fewer internalizing problems at 3-month follow-up relative to controls and a borderline significant time-by-group effect for PTSD intrusion symptoms was found (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study examining the efficacy of an indicated, early psychological intervention among both school-age and pre-school-age children. Because the intervention was ineffective for young children, no evidence-based practice can currently be suggested. Given that parents of pre-school children perceived the intervention as helpful, brief counseling of parents in terms of psychoeducation and training in coping skills still should be provided by clinicians, despite the current lack of evidence. To prevent trauma-related disorders in school-age children, the intervention might be used in a step-wise manner, where only children at risk for long-term psychological maladjustment are provided with psychological support	['SDG03']

10.1080/09581596.2015.1103837	International medicines governance 1940s to 1970s: lessons for public health	Public health advocates aim to maximise affordable access to good quality essential medicines. This goal often conflicts with the profit-seeking ambitions of the pharmaceutical industry. Since the World Trade Organisation&rsquo;s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement, the extension and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights has become the dominant discourse in global medicines governance. Public health advocates operating within this framework face significant obstacles and challenges. This paper presents an historical perspective to the contemporary debate over medicines and patents by examining the evolution of international medicines governance between the 1940s and 1970s. This research indicates that debates around IP and medicines were more advanced in terms of equity and access in the 1960s and 1970s than they are today. While acknowledging the existence of obstacles and challenges for advocates, the paper argues that alternative frameworks can and should be reasserted in global debates about medicines governance	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.06.071	Ecotoxicity of sediments in rivers: Invertebrate community, toxicity bioassays and the toxic unit approach as complementary assessment tools	AbstractThe determination of the real toxicity of sediments in aquatic ecosystems is challenging and necessary for an appropriate risk assessment. Different approaches have been developed and applied over the last several decades. Currently, the joint implementation of chemical, ecological and toxicological tools is recommended for an appropriate and successful toxicity risk assessment. We chose the combination of the toxic unit approach with acute pore water tests (Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Daphnia magna) and whole-sediment exposure tests (V. fischeri, Chironomus riparius), together with invertebrate community composition (multivariate analyses) to detect short and long-term responses of the organisms in four rivers of the Iberian Peninsula. High toxicity was detected in three sites (the downstream sites of the Llobregat and the Júcar, and the most upstream site of the Ebro). We identified organophosphate insecticides and metals as the main variables responsible for this toxicity, particularly in the whole-sediment tests. In particular, chlorpyrifos was mostly responsible for the toxicity (TUs) of D. magna, coinciding with the C. riparius mortality (long-term toxicity) in the mentioned sites, and copper was the main pollutant responsible for the short-term toxicity of P. subcapitata. The combination of the different approaches allowed us to detect ecotoxicological effects in organisms and identify the main contributors to the toxicity in these multi-stressed rivers	['SDG03']

10.1177/1757913915611162	Compost and Legionella longbeachae: An emerging infection?	Human disease caused by Legionella species is dominated by Legionella pneumophila, the main causative agent in cases of Legionnaires’ disease. However, other species are known to cause infection, for example, Legionella longbeachae causes an equivalent number of cases of disease as L. pneumophila in Australia and New Zealand. Infection with L. longbeachae is commonly associated with exposure to composts and potting soils, and cases of infection with this organism have been increasing in Europe over the past ten years. The increase in incidence may be linked to factors such as increased awareness of clinical presentation, or due to changing formulation of growing media, although it should be noted that the presence of Legionella species in growing media does not correlate with the number of cases currently seen. This is likely due to the variables associated with infection, for example, host factors such as smoking or underlying health conditions, or difference in growing media storage or climate, especially warm humid conditions, which may affect survival and growth of these organisms in the growing media environment. There are numerous unknowns in this area and collaboration between growing media manufacturers and researchers, as well as more awareness among diagnosing clinicians, laboratory staff and the general public is necessary to reduce risk. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn: L. pneumophila research currently dominates the field and it is likely that the overreliance on diagnostic techniques such as the urinary antigen test, which is specific for L. pneumophila Sg 1, is detrimental to the diagnosis of L. longbeachae infection	['SDG03']

We estimated human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series completion and examined predictors of completion among adolescents and young adults in a large family planning network.  Methods. Our retrospective cohort study of vaccine completion within 12 months and time to completion used electronic health record data from 119 Planned Parenthood health centers in 11 US states for 9648 patients who initiated HPV vaccination between January 2011 and January 2013.  Results. Among vaccine initiators, 29% completed the series within 12 months. Patients who were male, younger than 22 years, or non-Hispanic Black or who had public insurance were less likely to complete within 12 months and completed more slowly than their counterparts. Gender appeared to modify the effect of public versus private insurance on completion (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.76 for women and 0.95 for men; relative excess risk due to interaction = 0.41; 95% confidence interval = 0.09, 0.73).  Conclusions. Completion was low yet similar to previous studies conducted in safety net settings. </jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.09.021	Nano-sized polystyrene affects feeding, behavior and physiology of brine shrimp Artemia franciscana larvae	Nano-sized polymers as polystyrene (PS) constitute one of the main challenges for marine ecosystems, since they can distribute along the whole water column affecting planktonic species and consequently disrupting the energy flow of marine ecosystems. Nowadays very little knowledge is available on the impact of nano-sized plastics on marine organisms. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the effects of 40 nm anionic carboxylated (PS-COOH) and 50 nm cationic amino (PS-NH2) polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) on brine shrimp Anemia franciscana larvae. No signs of mortality were observed at 48 h of exposure for both PS NPs at naplius stage but several sub-lethal effects were evident. PS-COOH (5-100 mu g/ml) resulted massively sequestered inside the gut lumen of larvae (48 h) probably limiting food intake. Some of them were lately excreted as fecal pellets but not a full release was observed. Likewise, PS-NH2 (5-100 mu g/ml) accumulated in larvae (48 h) but also adsorbed at the surface of sensorial antennules and appendages probably hampering larvae motility. In addition, larvae exposed to PS-NH2 undergo multiple molting events during 48 h of exposure compared to controls. The activation of a defense mechanism based on a physiological process able to release toxic cationic NPs (PS-NH2) from the body can be hypothesized. The general observed accumulation of PS NPs within the gut during the 48 h of exposure indicates a continuous bioavailability of nano-sized PS for planktonic species as well as a potential transfer along the trophic web. Therefore, nano-sized PS might be able to impair food uptake (feeding), behavior (motility) and physiology (multiple molting) of brine shrimp larvae with consequences not only at organism and population level but on the overall ecosystem based on the key role of zooplankton on marine food webs.

Media coverage about the outbreak has been extensive, but there are large gaps in our understanding of the ways in which widely accessed social media sites are used during times of public health crisis. The purpose of this study was to analyze widely viewed videos about EVD on the YouTube video-sharing site.MethodsWe coded the source, content, and characteristics of the 100 most widely viewed videos about EVD on YouTube.ResultsThe videos included in the sample were viewed more than 73 million times. The death toll in West Africa was mentioned in nearly one-third of the videos. Over one-third of the videos mentioned how EVD was generally transmitted. There was little mention of treatment and no mention of the need for US funding of disaster preparedness; coordination between local, state, and federal governments; or beds ready for containment. No significant differences in the number of views were identified between video sources with the exception of a significantly higher number of views for “consumer videos” compared with “commercial television videos.”ConclusionsWith 1 billion unique users a month, YouTube has potential for both enhancing education and spreading misinformation.

Methods: In this study, a total of 208 M. tuberculosis isolates from smear-positive TB patients in Chongqing were genotyped by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat typing (MIRU-VNTR). In addition, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the distributions of drug susceptibility patterns and demographic data among different genotypes. Results: Our results showed that 156 MDR M. tuberculosis strains (75.0%) belonged to the Beijing genotype, while the other 52 strains (25.0%) were non-Beijing genotype. The proportion of Beijing genotype in the re-treated patient group was significantly higher than that in the new patient group (p = 0.013), while drug resistance and demographic characteristics showed no statistically significant associations with Beijing genotype (p > 0.05). In addition, the 208 strains were clustered into 193 genotypes using a 10-locus VNTR set; the cumulative clustering rate was 12.98% and the HGDI was 0.9991. Conclusions: Beijing genotype was the predominant genotype among the isolates from MDR-TB cases in Chongqing. The re-treated MDR-TB cases were more likely to be attributed to Beijing genotype infection. The 10-locus VNTR set demonstrated a good discrimination power for genotyping MDR M. tuberculosis isolates circulating in Chongqing Municipality	['SDG03']

10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051742	The impact of the 2009/2010 enhancement of cigarette health warning labels in Uruguay: Longitudinal findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Uruguay survey	BACKGROUND: FCTC Article 11 Guidelines recommend that health warning labels (HWLs) should occupy at least 50% of the package, but the tobacco industry claims that increasing the size would not lead to further benefits. This article reports the first population study to examine the impact of increasing HWL size above 50%. We tested the hypothesis that the 2009/2010 enhancement of the HWLs in Uruguay would be associated with higher levels of effectiveness. METHODS: Data were drawn from a cohort of adult smokers (≥18 years) participating in the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Uruguay Survey. The probability sample cohort was representative of adult smokers in 5 cities. The surveys included key indicators of HWL effectiveness. Data were collected in 2008/09 (pre-policy: Wave 2) and 2010/11 (post-policy: Wave 3). RESULTS: Overall, 1746 smokers participated in the study at Wave 2 (n=1,379) and Wave 3 (n=1,411). Following the 2009/2010 HWL changes in Uruguay (from 50% to 80% in size), all indicators of HWL effectiveness increased significantly [noticing HWLs: odds ratio (OR)=1.44, p=0.015; reading HWLs: OR=1.42, p=0.002; impact of HWLs on thinking about risks of smoking: OR=1.66, p<0.001; HWLs increasing thinking about quitting: OR=1.76, p<0.001; avoiding looking at the HWLs: OR=2.35, p<.001; and reports that HWLs stopped smokers from having a cigarette “many times”: OR=3.42, p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: The 2009/2010 changes to HWLs in Uruguay, including a substantial increment in size, led to increases of key HWL indicators, thus supporting the conclusion that enhancing HWLs beyond minimum guideline recommendations can lead to even higher levels of effectiveness	['SDG03']

BMI was measured directly and other information was gathered by interview. Over half (59 %, n = 270) were obese including 18 % (n = 83) who were morbidly obese. In hierarchical ordinary least squares regression analysis controlling for demographic, psychiatric, medical, smoking, and health insurance statuses, women were significantly more likely to be obese than men. Obesity also was more likely among those who were younger and not high school graduates, those with diabetes or hypertension, and those who did not smoke tobacco. Interaction effects were found between gender and diabetes, hypertension, tobacco smoking, education, race, and age. The high prevalence of obesity among women, coupled with interactions between gender and other factors, suggest that targeted approaches are needed to promote optimal physical health in this population	['SDG03']

10.1038/srep18916	A New Method to Jointly Estimate the Mortality Risk of Long-Term Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter and its Components	Most studies on the association between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) and mortality have considered only total concentration of PM(2.5) or individual components of PM(2.5), and not the combined effects of concentration and particulate composition. We sought to develop a method to estimate the risk of death from long-term exposure to PM(2.5) and the distribution of its components, namely: sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, organic mass, black carbon, and mineral dust. We decomposed PM(2.5) exposure into the sum of total concentration and the proportion of each component. We estimated the risk of death due to exposure using a cohort of ~2.4 million Canadians who were followed for vital status over 16 years. Modelling the concentration of PM(2.5) with the distribution of the proportions of components together was a superior predictor for mortality than either total PM(2.5) concentration alone, or all component concentrations modelled together. Our new approach has the advantage of characterizing the toxicity of the atmosphere in its entirety. This is required to fully understand the health benefits associated with strategies to improve air quality that may result in complex changes not only in PM(2.5) concentration, but also in the distribution of particle components	['SDG03']

Participants were taken through a comprehensive eye examination after the administration of a structured questionnaire.Results520 male commercial vehicle drivers were enrolled for this study with a mean age of 39.23years ±10.96 years and mean visual acuity of 0.02±0.08 logMAR. Protans were more likely to be involved in RTAs (χ2=6.194, p=0.034). However, there was no statistically significant association between abnormal stereopsis (OR=0.89 95% CI: 0.44–1.80, p=0.56), poor vision due to refractive error (χ2=3.090, p=0.388) and the occurrence of RTAs. While 86.9% were aware of abnormal stereopsis, only 45% were aware of colour vision defects. There was a statistically significant association between stereopsis anomaly and colour vision defect (r=0.371, p<0.005).ConclusionThe study found an association between protanopia and RTAs but none between stereopsis anomalies, refractive errors and the occurrence of RTAs. Drivers were less knowledgeable on colour vision defects as compared to stereopsis anomalies	['SDG03']

10.1002/ijc.29875	Lung cancer treatment is influenced by income, education, age and place of residence in a country with universal health coverage	Selection of lung cancer treatment should be based on tumour characteristics, physiological reserves and preferences of the patient. Our aims were to identify and quantify other factors associated with treatment received. Lung cancer patient data from 2002 to 2011 were obtained from the national population-based Cancer Registry of Norway, Statistics Norway and the Norwegian Patient Register. Multivariable logistic regression examined whether year of diagnosis, age, sex, education, income, health trust, smoking status, extent of disease, histology and comorbidities were associated with choice of treatment; surgery or radical or palliative radiotherapy, within 1 year of diagnosis. Among the 24,324 lung cancer patients identified, the resection rate remained constant while the proportion of radical radiotherapy administered increased from 8.6 to 14.1%. Older patients, those with lower household incomes and certain health trusts were less likely to receive any treatment. Lower education and the male gender were identified as negative predictors for receiving surgery. Smoking history was positively associated with both radical and palliative radiotherapy, while comorbidity and symptoms were independently associated with receiving surgery and palliative radiotherapy. Although Norway is a highly egalitarian country with a free, universal healthcare system, this study indicates that surgery and radical and palliative radiotherapy were under-used among the elderly, those with a lower socioeconomic status and those living in certain health trusts. What's new? According to Norwegian guidelines, lung cancer treatment should be based on extent of disease, tumour histology, comorbidities, performance status and preferences of the patient. Here, the authors present the first nationwide population-based study to examine and quantify the association between nonguideline-specified factors and surgical treatment and radical radiotherapy or palliative radiotherapy for lung cancer patients. The results suggest that even in a highly egalitarian country with a free, universal healthcare system such as Norway, lung cancer patients with low socioeconomic status, advanced age and living in certain areas are less likely to receive surgery, radical radiotherapy and palliative radiotherapy	['SDG03']
10.1177/0017896914568518	A path model of smoking behaviour among senior high school students in Taiwan	Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the ways in which social smoking expectations mediate the relationship between adolescent smoking behaviour and the smoking behaviour of family and peers. Design: Descriptive, cross-sectional survey. Setting: Taiwan, Republic of China. Method: The participants were 921 senior high school students who completed a questionnaire to measure smoking status, family and peer smoking and social smoking expectations. The survey was conducted from November to December in 2009. Structural equation modelling was performed to test a mediation model. Analysis was performed using PRELIS 2 and LISREL 8.7 software. Results: After adjusting for students’ gender, age and school type, it is clear that social expectations mediate the relationship between sibling smoking, peer smoking and adolescent smoking. The path coefficients of sibling and peer smoking on social expectations in the mediator model were moderate, β = .15–.41, p &lt; .05, but the coefficient of social expectations on adolescent smoking was strong, β = .95, p &lt; .001. The total indirect effects between exogenous latent variables and adolescent smoking were .54, indicating a strong association that, in this model, is explained by the mediation of social expectations. Conclusion: Determining the mechanisms that influence adolescent smoking is of scientific interest because knowledge of these mechanisms is a prerequisite for the development of recommendations aimed at prevention. With this knowledge, health professionals can develop smoking-prevention policies and education programmes based on reducing the mediating effect of social smoking expectations on the relationship of family smoking and peer smoking with adolescent smoking. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

The multiple regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the variables and to compare the performance of 6MWT and spirometry tests. Results: A total of 78 participants were recruited into the study. 6MWT was done completely in all cases without any complications. Among these tests, 14 cases (17.9%) had contraindications to spirometry and two cases were unable to achieve the criteria for acceptable efforts. PPC developed in 17 cases (21%) with a high mortality (17.7%). A multiple regression analysis showed elderly, poor general health status, smoking history, low level of the mean value of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted (by spirometry) and shorter 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) were the independent factors associated with PPC. Patients developing PPC had a significantly lower preoperative 6MWD compared with patients without PPC (256.0 ± 48.0 versus 440.0 ± 117.1 meters, p &lt; 0.001). 6MWD of ⩽325 meters was a threshold for predicting PPC with 77% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and had a good predictive value for PPC similar to that for the FEV1 %. Conclusions: Preoperative 6MWT is a very useful alternative test for predicting PPC in high risk patients scheduled to undergo surgery under GA. </jats:sec	['SDG03']
10.1161/circoutcomes.114.001545	Association of Smoking Status with Angina and Health-Related Quality of Life after Acute Myocardial Infarction	Background—             Smoking cessation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) decreases the risk of recurrent AMI and mortality by 30% to 50%, but many patients continue to smoke. The association of smoking with angina and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after AMI is unclear.                                   Methods and Results—             Patients in 2 US multicenter AMI registries (n=4003) were assessed for smoking and HRQOL at admission and 1, 6, and 12 months after AMI. Angina and HRQOL were measured with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and Short Form-12 Physical and Mental Component Scales. At admission, 29% never had smoked, 34% were former smokers (quit before AMI), and 37% were active smokers, of whom 46% quit by 1 year (recent quitters). In hierarchical, multivariable, regression models that adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical and treatment factors, never and former smokers had similar and the best HRQOL in all domains. Recent quitters had intermediate HRQOL levels, with angina and Short Form-12 Mental Component Scale scores similar to never smokers. Persistent smokers had worse HRQOL in all domains compared with never smokers and worse Short Form-12 Mental Component Scale scores than recent quitters.                                   Conclusions—             Smoking after AMI is associated with more angina and worse HRQOL in all domains, whereas smokers who quit after AMI have similar angina levels and mental health as never smokers. These observations may help encourage patients to stop smoking after AMI.           </jats:sec	['SDG03']

Our study aimed to describe the incidence, epidemiologic characteristics, and outcomes of patients who experience TICA in a dedicated clinical pathway for post-cardiac arrest care between November 2007 and February 2013. All patients were treated in an evidence-based clinical pathway that included TH. Database and medical records were independently reviewed by investigators to ascertain TICA. TICA was defined as cardiac arrest (CA) directly and immediately caused by a xenobiotic exposure. All patients were enrolled at Carolinas Medical Center, an urban 874-bed teaching hospital that serves as a regional cardiac resuscitation center. All patients were adult victims of cardiac arrest who had obtained return of spontaneous circulation and were enrolled in a clinical pathway for post-cardiac arrest care that included TH. Three hundred eighty-nine patients underwent treatment following CA during the study period and 48 (12 %) were deemed TICA. Patients who suffered TICA were slightly younger, less likely to have an initial shockable rhythm, and less likely to receive bystander CPR as compared to non-toxic cases. TICA accounted for a significant proportion of patients in this study. Additional, larger studies are needed to fully elucidate the optimal role for TH in TICA	['SDG03']

With no approved vaccines or specific treatments for Ebola, clinical trials were launched within months of the epidemic in an unprecedented show of global partnership. One of these trials used a highly innovative “ring vaccination” design. The design was chosen for operational, scientific, and ethical reasons—in particular, it was regarded as ethically superior to individually randomized placebo-controlled trials.  We scrutinize the ethical rationale for the ring vaccination design. We argue that the ring vaccination design is ethical but fundamentally equivalent to placebo-controlled designs with respect to withholding a potentially effective intervention from the control group.  We discuss the implications for the ongoing ring vaccination trial and future research. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.3109/00016357.2015.1114669	Dental patients perceptions and motivation in smoking cessation activities	Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate smokers' perceptions of and motivation for smoking cessation activities in dentistry. Materials and methods Patients who smoked were consecutively recruited from general as well as specialist dental care clinics in Sweden. After a dental visit the patients completed a questionnaire about self-perceived oral health, smoking habits, motivation, reasons to quit and not to quit smoking, support to quit, smoking cessation activities and questions about smoking asked by dentists and dental hygienists. Results The sample consisted of 167 adult patients (≥ 20 years) who smoked daily. During the last 6 months, 81% of the patients had experienced oral health problems. The most common complaints were discolourations of the teeth, periodontal problems and dry mouth (38%, 36% and 33%, respectively). Improved general health was a major reason to quit smoking (89%). It was also stated that it was important to avoid oral health problems. 71% of the patients preferred to quit by themselves and 16% wanted support from dentistry. High motivation to quit smoking was reported by 20%. Occurrence of periodontitis during the last 6 months was significantly associated with being highly motivated to stop smoking (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.03-8.55). Conclusions This study revealed that, although it was important to quit smoking to avoid oral health problems, the patients were not aware that tobacco cessation activities can be performed in dentistry. Periodontal problems seem to be the most motivating factor among the patients who were highly motivated to stop smoking	['SDG03']

10.1007/s10461-015-1161-4	Armed Conflict, Substance Use and HIV: A Global Analysis	Armed conflict is frequently assumed to be a contributor to the global HIV epidemic, but existing evidence is sparse. We examined the relationship between armed conflict between 2002-2008 and HIV disability life years (DALYs) in 2010 among WHO Member States. Using partial least squares analysis we also examined moderation of the armed conflict-HIV link by two susceptibility constructs (background risk, substance use) and one vulnerability mediator (numbers of refugees, people on ART, and total HIV spending). Background risk directly impacted HIV DALYs (p<0.05), substance use moderated the conflict-HIV relationship (p<0.01). The vulnerability construct mediated the conflict-HIV association (p<0.01). Findings underscore the need to align HIV prevention/intervention efforts with pre-existing HIV burden and reduce the impact of natural disasters on the populace in conflict-affected states. Integration of substance prevention/harm reduction programs within national HIV responses, attention to most-at-risk populations and increased surveillance/treatment of drug resistant HIV and TB is warranted	['SDG03']

Criteria were categorized according to the World Health Organization's health system goals and building block frameworks. People living with HIV/AIDS (n = 49), healthcare workers (HCW) (n = 41), the general population (n = 43), and policy makers (n = 22) rated the importance of thirty-two criteria on a 5-point Likert-scale. Thereafter, respondents ranked the highest rated criteria to express more detailed preferences.Results: Stakeholders valued the following criteria as most important for the priority setting of HIV/AIDS interventions: an intervention's impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic, reduction of stigma, quality of care, effectiveness on individual level, and feasibility in terms of current capacity of the health system (i.e., HCW, product, information, and service requirements), financial sustainability, and acceptance by donors. Overall, stakeholders’ preferences for the importance of criteria are similar.Conclusions: Our study design outlines an approach for other settings to identify which criteria are important for priority setting of health interventions. For Indonesia, these study results may be used in priority setting processes for HIV/AIDS control and may contribute to more transparent and systematic allocation of resources.</jats:p	['SDG03']

The study group consisted of 138 fractures (134 patients). There were 107 males (78%) and 31 females (22%) and median age of 35 years (IQR 24-45). The most common mechanism of injury was a road traffic accident (78%). Sixty percent (n = 83) had an injury severity score of &ge; 15 indicating major trauma. The most common fracture type (75%) was simple or wedge comminuted (2B1) according to the Edinburgh classification. The median interval between the injury and operation was 3 days (IQR 1-6). Plate fixation was performed in 110 fractures (80%) and intramedullary fixation was performed in 28 fractures (20%). There were 85 males and 25 females in the plate fixation group with median age of 35 years (IQR: 25-45) There were 22 males and 6 females in intramedullary fixation group with median age of 31 years (IQR 24-42 years). Statistical analysis was performed using Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney test, and Chi-square test. Significant P-value was &lt; 0.05.Results: The overall incidence of complication was 14.5% (n = 20). The overall nonunion rate 6%. Post operative wound infection occurred in 3.6% of cases. The incidence of complication associated with plate fixation was 10% (11 of 110 cases) compared to 32% associated with intramedullary fixation (9 of 28 cases) (P = 0.003). Thirty five percent of complications were related to inadequate surgical technique and potentially avoidable. Symptomatic hardware requiring removal occurred in 23% (n = 31) of patients. Symptomatic metalware was more frequent after plate fixation compared to intramedullary fixation (26% vs 7%, P = 0.03).Conclusions: Intramedullary fixation of midshaft clavicle fracture is associated with higher incidence of complications. Plate fixation is associated with a higher rate of symptomatic metalware requiring removal compared to intramedullary fixation. Approximately one in three complications may be avoided by attention to adequate surgical technique	['SDG03']

This paper aims to describe the prevalence of PCC delivery among publicly funded clinics, prior to the recommendations. METHODS: Prevalence of providing occasional or frequent PCC in the last 3 months and having written protocols for recommended PCC screenings were estimated in 2015 using survey data collected from a nationally representative sample of publicly funded clinic administrators (2013–2014, N=1,615). Analyses included examination of differential distributions of outcomes by clinic characteristics (p<0.05) and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of occasional or frequent PCC delivery was 81% for women and 38% for men. The percentage of clinics with written protocols for specific PCC screenings ranged from 74% to 88% (women) and 66% to 83% (men). Prevalence of having written protocols for all PCC screenings was 29% for women and 22% for men. Characteristics negatively associated with having written protocols for all PCC screenings for women and men (respectively) were as follows: not receiving Title X funding (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR]=0.6, 95% CI=0.50, 0.76; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.47, 0.77) and being a community health center (APR=0.5, 95% CI=0.37, 0.72; APR=0.5, 95% CI=0.30, 0.67); health department (APR=0.7, 95% CI=0.61, 0.87; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.49, 0.76); or hospital/other (APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.50, 0.79; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.43, 0.75) (versus Planned Parenthood). CONCLUSIONS: Provision of PCC appears to differ by clinic characteristics and by interpretation of the phrase “preconception care,” suggesting opportunities for education and improvement	['SDG03']

The present level of the state tobacco control has been achieved through adopting legal regulations and population-based interventions. In Poland a sufficient contribution of health professionals to the diagnosis of the tobacco-addition syndrome (TAS) and the application of the 5A’s (ask, advice, assess, assist, arrange follow-up) brief intervention, has not been confirmed by explicit research results. Systemic solutions of the health care system of the professional control, specialist health care, health professional trainings and reference centres have not as yet been elaborated. The tools for diagnosing tobacco dependence and motivation to quit smoking, developed over 30 years ago and recommended by experts to be used in clinical and research practice, have not met the current addiction criteria. In this paper other tools than those previously recommended − tests developed in the first decade of the 21st century (including Cigarette Dependence Scale and Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale), reflecting modern concepts of nicotine dependence are presented. In the literature on the readiness/motivation to change health behaviors, a new approach dominates. The motivational interviewing (MI) by Miller and Rollnick concentrates on a smoking person and his or her internal motivation. Motivational interviewing is recommended by the World Health Organization as a 5R’s (relevance, risks, rewards, roadblocks, repetition) brief motivational advice, addressed to tobacco users who are unwilling to make a quit attempt. In Poland new research studies on the implementation of new diagnostic tools and updating of binding guidelines should be undertaken, to strengthen primary health care in treating tobacco dependence, and to incorporate MI and 5R’s into trainings in TAS diagnosing and treating addressed to health professionals.

A retrospective review identified 19 cases, including eight with major brain lesions and severe microcephaly, six with severe cerebral lesions without microcephaly and five with brainstem dysfunction without visible malformations. Imaging revealed profound neurological lesions (septal and callosal disruption, ventriculomegaly, abnormal neuronal migration, cerebellar hypoplasia, occipital pseudocysts, brain calcifications). Amniotic fluid was drawn from seven cases at gestation weeks 20 to 29. ZIKV RNA was detected by RT-PCR and infectious ZIKV isolates were obtained in four of five microcephalic, but not in two non-microcephalic cases with severe brain lesions. Medical termination of pregnancy was performed in eleven cases; two cases with brainstem dysfunction died in the first months of life; six cases are alive, with severe neurological impairment. The results show that four of seven tested fetuses with major neurological injuries were infected with ZIKV in utero. For other non-microcephalic, congenital abnormalities we were not able to prove or exclude ZIKV infection retrospectively. The unusual occurrence of brain malformations or dysfunction without microcephaly following a ZIKV outbreak needs further studies.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Computational pregnant occupant modelling has an additional important role in the investigation of the risk of fetus mortality in crash test simulations. In this paper, the effect of including the fetus in the uterus of the pregnant occupant model is investigated. First, isolated drop test simulations with the uterus of the computational pregnant occupant model, ‘Expecting’, with and without a fetus are used to show the effect of the presence of fetus in the uterus model. Then ‘Expecting’ with and without the fetus is used with varying levels of restraint system use, such as fully restrained, ‘seatbelt only’, ‘airbag only’ and ‘no restraint’, in frontal crash simulations, representing five levels of impacts. Maximum strains developed in the uteroplacental interface with and without a fetus are compared in every case. Both simulations predict higher risks of placental abruption when the fetus is included in the model. Simulations with and without a fetus model show that inclusion of a 38-week fetus model causes higher strains in the placental region of uterus	['SDG03']

Esta se fortaleceu com a criação do SUS em 1988, imprescindível para implementar o programa nacional de Controle das DST/AIDS, baseado nos direitos humanos, visando equidade, inclusão, integralidade e contra o preconceito e a discriminação. O Brasil foi dos primeiros a disponibilizar, já em 1996, na saúde pública, tratamento adequado para todas as PVHA. O artigo descreve os êxitos e os indesculpáveis retrocessos destes 30 primeiros anos e as perspectivas para o controle e eventual eliminação da aids. Pode-se afirmar que há condições para eliminar o preconceito, a discriminação e diminuir a disparidade, pano de fundo para a disseminação da AIDS e de outras epidemias. Estão disponíveis instrumentos para tratar adequadamente as PVHA, para eliminar a transmissão do HIV e proteger os direitos de todos. Entretanto, para que isso aconteça, é necessária a ampliação do acesso à educação, incluindo educação sexual, e cuidados de saúde de qualidade. Necessário ainda o enfrentamento diuturno do conservadorismo e de toda violência e discriminação contra pessoas em risco ou vivendo com HIV. A experiência brasileira nestes 30 anos é inestimável alavanca para alcançar o fim da epidemia	['SDG03']
10.1007/s10461-016-1369-y	Prescription Opioid Injection Among HIV-Positive People Who Inject Drugs in a Canadian Setting	Prescription opioids (POs) are commonly prescribed to patients living with HIV/AIDS, while the illicit use of POs remains a major public health concern throughout Canada and the United States. We sought to identify the prevalence and correlates of PO injection among HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) in Vancouver, Canada, where HIV/AIDS treatment and care is offered at no cost. We examined data from 634 individuals from an ongoing prospective cohort of HIV-positive PWID. Between December 2005 and November 2013, the median prevalence of recent PO injection was 24.2 % [interquartile range (IQR): 21.5–25.8 %]. In a multivariable generalized estimating equation model, Caucasian ethnicity, heroin injection, and drug dealing were positively associated with PO injection, while older age and methadone maintenance treatment were negatively associated with PO injection (all p < 0.05).

10.1186/s12909-016-0638-9	Training needs assessment of health care professionals in a developing country: The example of Saint Lucia	BACKGROUND: Continuing education (CE) is crucial for quality improvement in health care. The needs assessment of CE helps ensure effectiveness. However, such an assessment necessitates certain techniques that are unfamiliar to health care communities in developing countries. This study identifies the needs of providing CE to health care personnel in Saint Lucia. METHODS: This study was designed as a questionnaire survey to investigate the demographics, training needs, and preferred approaches to improve performance of the target population. The study population included the health care professionals of major public health care facilities in Saint Lucia. We used the World Health Organization–adopted Hennessy Hicks Training Needs Analysis Questionnaire, a self-reported close-ended structured questionnaire with a core set of 30 items. These items refer to tasks that are central to the role of health care professionals and are categorized into six superordinate categories: research/audit, communication/teamwork, clinical skills, administrative, managerial/supervisory, and continuing professional education. RESULTS: In total, 208 questionnaires were distributed; the response rate was 66.8 %, and most respondents were nurses. The need for continuing professional education was rated the highest priority, followed by research/audit activities. The evidence suggests that most respondents required training in communication skills, management, clinical skills, and research methods. CONCLUSIONS: Providing training according to the needs is vital, particularly in developing countries. The present research methodology and findings offer perspectives on how to conduct needs assessment and offer reference points for developing countries whose background and health care environment are similar to those of Saint Lucia.

Method systematic review and meta-synthesis, from the following information sources: PubMed, CINAHL, Scielo, Web of Science, PsycInfo, SCOPUS, DEDALUS and Proquest, using the keyword Primary Health Care associated, separately, with the following keywords: humanization of assistance, holistic care/health, patient centred care, user embracement, personal autonomy, holism, attitude of health personnel.  Results thirty studies between 1999-2011. Primary Health Care work processes are complex and present difficulties for conducting integrative care, especially for nursing, but humanizing practices have showed an important role towards the development of positive work environments, quality of care and people-centered care by promoting access and universal health coverage.  Conclusions nursing challenges for universal health coverage are related to education and training, to better working conditions and clear definition of nursing role in primary health care. It is necessary to overcome difficulties such as fragmented concepts of health and care and invest in multidisciplinary teamwork, community empowerment, professional-patient bond, user embracement, soft technologies, to promote quality of life, holistic care and universal health coverage.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1111/puar.12564	The Theory and Practice of “Nudging”: Changing Health Behaviors	Many of the most significant challenges in health care—such as smoking, overeating, and poor adherence to evidence-based guidelines—will only be resolved if we can influence behavior. The traditional policy tools used when thinking about influencing behavior include legislation, regulation, and information provision. Recently, policy analysts have shown interest in policies that “nudge” people in particular directions, drawing on advances in understanding that behavior is strongly influenced in largely automatic ways by the context within which it is placed. This article considers the theoretical basis for why nudges might work and reviews the evidence in health behavior change. The evidence is structured according to the Mindspace framework for behavior change. The conclusion is that insights from behavioral economics offer powerful policy tools for influencing behavior in health care. This article provides public administration practitioners with an accessible summary of this literature, putting these insights into practical use	['SDG03']

10.1038/srep26328	Functional analysis of the N-Terminal basic motif of a eukaryotic satellite RNA virus capsid protein in replication and packaging	Efficient replication and assembly of virus particles are integral to the establishment of infection. In addition to the primary role of the capsid protein (CP) in encapsidating the RNA progeny, experimental evidence on positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses suggests that the CP also regulates RNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that replication of Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) is controlled by the cooperative interaction between STMV CP and the helper virus (HV) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase. We identified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively charged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa) motif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between HV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine substitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP binding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective in packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the 3′ terminal 150 nt region. These findings provide insights into the mechanism underlying the regulation of STMV replication and packaging	['SDG03']
10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009907	Association between perception of fault for the crash and function, return to work and health status 1 year after road traffic injury: A registry-based cohort study	Objectives: To establish the association between the patient’s perception of fault for the crash and 12- month outcomes after non-fatal road traffic injury. Setting: Two adult major trauma centres, one regional trauma centre and one metropolitan trauma centre in Victoria, Australia. Participants: 2605 adult, orthopaedic trauma patients covered by the state’s no-fault third party insurer for road traffic injury, injured between September 2010 and February 2014. Outcome measures: EQ-5D-3L, return to work and functional recovery (Glasgow Outcome Scale— Extended score of upper good recovery) at 12 months postinjury. Results: After adjusting for key confounders, the adjusted relative risk (ARR) of a functional recovery (0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69) and return to work (0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99) were lower for the not at fault compared to the at fault group. The ARR of reporting problems on EQ-5D items was 1.20–1.35 times higher in the not at fault group. Conclusions: Patients who were not at fault, or denied being at fault despite a police report of fault, experienced poorer outcomes than the at fault group. Attributing fault to others was associated with poorer outcomes. Interventions to improve coping, or to resolve negative feelings from the crash, could facilitate better outcomes in the future.Belinda J Gabbe, Pamela M Simpson, Peter A Cameron, Christina L Ekegren, Elton R Edwards, Richard Page, Susan Liew, Andrew Bucknill, Richard de Steige	['SDG03']

This article provides an overview of the development and implementation of an electronic tobacco cessation protocol (the eTobacco protocol), into an electronic medical record (EMR) system, while evaluating the barriers and benefits encountered. The protocol was developed to facilitate the process of electronically referring patients to a state-funded quitline service by establishing a one-click connect for providers to use within the EMR system. While evaluating the implementation of the protocol, findings indicate that several barriers were encountered including disruption of clinic workflow, EMR limitations, and training complications. In spite of the barriers, the protocol shows promising results by increasing referrals to the quitline from 7 patients the year prior to implementation to 1,254 patients after the implementation of the electronic solution. Health care systems that have the ability to modify their EMR system can help lower tobacco use rates among their patients while meeting Meaningful Use requirements. Future research should examine if referrals through the eTobacco protocol are directly associated with patients’ tobacco cessation rates. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1108/srj-09-2015-0127	Tobacco manufacturer brand strategy following plain packaging in Australia: Implications for social responsibility and policy	Purpose This paper aims to inform social responsibility and social policy by describing the brand strategy of Australia’s largest tobacco manufacturer, British American Tobacco Australia (BATA), the year following the introduction of plain packaging and other regulation. Tobacco controls are a proven catalyst for reducing smoking, but manufacturers adapt swiftly seeking to minimise the impact of regulatory change.   Design/methodology/approach BATA’s strategy was determined using 2012-2014 tobacco ingredient reports, recommended retail price lists and a supermarket retail audit.   Findings The research identified over 70 BATA brand variants, offered in diverse packaging options, with new products and modified names appearing since 2012. In total 14 main brands are highly differentiated by price, with 45 per cent difference between the cheapest and the most expensive. Volume discounting occurs across packaging ranges, with twin packs offering best value and prices up to 10 per cent lower than those of single packs.   Originality/value The research originality stems from the triangulation of three different data resources to establish brand strategy following increased regulation. The study confirms ongoing market segmentation using highly differentiated ranges, and it reveals the unintended consequences of corporate responses to regulation. Evolving variant names communicate product information and imagery previously imparted by pack design. Pricing strategies enable smokers to offset substantial excise increases through brand switching and volume buying. The research, therefore, reveals the potential for regulating these as yet unrestricted elements to enhance the impact of plain packaging and other tobacco controls, thereby further reducing the social impact of smoking. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone) and arrhythmia hospitalization or arrhythmia mortality. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were analyzed via a random-effects model and reported as relative risk and 95% confidence interval. 25 studies satisfied our inclusion criteria and 23 contributed to the meta-analysis. Arrhythmia hospitalization or mortality were associated with increases in PM2.5 (RR = 1.015 per 10 μg/m3, 95% CI: 1.006–1.024), PM10 (RR = 1.009 per 10 μg/m3, 95% CI: 1.004–1.014), carbon monoxide (RR = 1.041 per 1 ppm, 95% CI: 1.017–1.065), nitrogen dioxide (RR = 1.036 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.020–1.053), and sulfur dioxide (RR = 1.021 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 1.003–1.039), but not ozone (RR = 1.012 per 10 ppb, 95% CI: 0.997–1.027).

10.1177/1753425916650272	Biomass smoke as a risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Effects on innate immunity	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, is considered an archetypical disease of innate immunity, where inhaled particles and gases trigger an inflammatory response, favoring tissue proliferation in small airways and tissue destruction in lung parenchyma, in addition to the recruitment of immune cells to these compartments. Although cigarette smoking is still considered the main risk factor for developing COPD, the trend of proposing biomass smoke (BS) exposure as a principal risk factor is gaining importance, as around 3 billion people worldwide are exposed to this pollutant daily. A considerable amount of evidence has shown the potential of BS as an enhancer of lung inflammation. However, an impairment of some innate immune responses after BS exposure has also been described. Regarding the mechanisms by which biomass smoke alters the innate immune responses, three main classes of cell surface receptors—the TLRs, the scavenger receptors and the transient receptor potential channels—have shown the ability to transduce signals initiated after BS exposure. This article is an updated and comprehensive review of the immunomodulatory effects described after the interaction of BS components with these receptors. </jats:p	['SDG03']

Factors That Influence Trust for Persons Living With HIV/AIDS	Trust in one’s health care provider, trust in the health care system in general, and even trust in one’s community affects engagement in HIV-related health care. This article examines the issue of trust among a random sample of HIV-infected individuals residing in Mississippi, an area hard-hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Five constructs based on survey responses from these individuals were developed: (1) trust in one’s provider to offer the best possible medical care, (2) trust in one’s provider to protect patient privacy, (3) willingness to disclose HIV status to one’s provider, (4) trust in the health care system, and (5) trust in one’s community. Findings suggest that interventions to improve trust in providers to deliver the highest quality of care should be targeted to young people, African Americans, and the more highly educated. Interventions to increase trust in providers to protect privacy should focus on creating and strengthening social support groups or networks that build relationships and foster trust. Interventions aimed to increase community trust also should be targeted to young people. This information is useful to researchers, policy makers, health care providers, and organizations interested in prioritizing interventions and strategies that have the greatest potential to reduce health disparities in HIV diagnosis and treatment in the Deep South. </jats:p	['SDG03']

We examined the effects of a guided imagery intervention on perceived stress in pregnant adolescents.                METHOD. Thirty-five pregnant adolescents recruited from a local alternative education program participated in a guided imagery intervention. Participants listened to a pregnancy-specific guided imagery recording on four separate occasions during their pregnancies. Perceived stress was measured immediately before and after each session using the Perceived Stress Measure–9 (PSM–9).                RESULTS. Participants’ pre- and postsession PSM–9 scores for three of the four sessions demonstrated a significant reduction in stress. Participants’ baseline stress levels also decreased significantly across the four listening sessions. The greatest reductions in stress within and between sessions occurred in the early sessions, with effects diminishing over time.                CONCLUSION. Pregnant teens experienced initial short- and long-term stress reduction during a guided imagery intervention, supporting the use of guided imagery to reduce stress in pregnant adolescents.</jats:p	['SDG03']

This study investigates predictors of support for a quit attempt. Partners of smokers ( N = 131) reported their relationship quality, concern for partner’s health, own smoking status, and intended support for a quit attempt. Smokers were less supportive than were nonsmokers. Relationship quality, concern for partners’ health, and motivation to quit were positively associated, and nicotine dependence was negatively associated, with intended support. The findings suggest that support for smoking cessation depends on one’s own smoking behaviors as well as characteristics of the relationship. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1152/ajplung.00205.2015	Effects of mannose-binding lectin on pulmonary gene expression and innate immune inflammatory response to ozone	Ozone is a common, potent oxidant pollutant in industrialized nations. Ozone exposure causes airway hyperreactivity, lung hyperpermeability, inflammation, and cell damage in humans and laboratory animals, and exposure to ozone has been associated with exacerbation of asthma, altered lung function, and mortality. The mechanisms of ozone-induced lung injury and differential susceptibility are not fully understood. Ozone-induced lung inflammation is mediated, in part, by the innate immune system. We hypothesized that mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an innate immunity serum protein, contributes to the proinflammatory events caused by ozone-mediated activation of the innate immune system. Wild-type ( Mbl+/+) and MBL-deficient ( Mbl−/−) mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) for up to 72 h, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was examined for inflammatory markers. Mean numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils and levels of the neutrophil attractants C-X-C motif chemokines 2 [ Cxcl2 (major intrinsic protein 2)] and 5 [ Cxcl5 (limb expression, LIX)] in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly lower in Mbl−/− than Mbl+/+ mice exposed to ozone. Using genome-wide mRNA microarray analyses, we identified significant differences in transcript response profiles and networks at baseline [e.g., nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response] and after exposure (e.g., humoral immune response) between Mbl+/+ and Mbl−/− mice. The microarray data were further analyzed to discover several informative differential response patterns and subsequent gene sets, including the antimicrobial response and the inflammatory response. We also used the lists of gene transcripts to search the LINCS L1000CDS2 data sets to identify agents that are predicted to perturb ozone-induced changes in gene transcripts and inflammation. These novel findings demonstrate that targeted deletion of Mbl caused differential levels of inflammation-related gene sets at baseline and after exposure to ozone and significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation, thus indicating an important innate immunomodulatory role of the gene in this model. </jats:p	['SDG03']

Moreover, novel approaches in the classification of lung cancer based on molecular techniques have started to bring new insights to its aetiology, in particular among nonsmokers. Despite the success in delineation of tobacco smoking as the major risk factor for lung cancer, this highly preventable disease remains among the most common and most lethal cancers globally.Future preventive efforts and research need to focus on non-cigarette tobacco smoking products, as well as better understanding of risk factors underlying lung carcinogenesis in never-smokers.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.15789/1563-0625-2016-1-51-62	Immunological characteristic of synthetic peptides similar to actual HIV antigen determinants	The development of HIV vaccine remains an important goal in prophylaxis and therapy of HIV/ AIDS epidemics. There are various approaches for development of а candidate vaccine based on induction of neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. Synthetic peptides are considered promising vaccine antigens since they are capable of activating both humoral and cellular immune response. HIV-1 envelope gp120 is the target for neutralizing antiviral antibodies. The V3 region of the HIV-1 gp120 is highly immunogenic and important for the virus-coreceptor interaction. In a RV144 vaccine trial, the levels of vaccine-induced IgG antibodies recognizing V1V2 regions from multiple HIV-1 subtypes show inverse correlations with a risk for HIV-1 infection. Meanwhile, HIV is characterized by high diversity. The consensus and mosaic immunogens are complete but artificial proteins, which are computationally designed to elicit immune responses with improved cross-reactive broadness. We have been studied immunogenic properties of synthetic peptides derived from V1, V2, V3 loop regions of the consensus M HIV1 (CON-S) sequence group of the gp 120 envelope protein and V3 loop derived from a Russian RUA022a2 isolate. These peptides specifically reacted to HIV-positive sera in ELISA, thus indicating their similarity to appropriate HIV proteins. The peptides proved to be weakly immunogenic. Therefore, Freund complete adjuvant was used to enhance peptide immunogenicity. To assess the immunogenicity, the mice were immunized with a peptide mixture. Antibodies have been developed to every peptide from the mixture, being, predominantly, of IgG isotype. The antibody titers depended on the length of peptide sequences. However, the sera from immunized mice did not have a HIV neutralizing activity. The serum neutralization was assessed by pseudovirus-based assay, using a molecular clone of virus isolates CAP 45.2.00.G3 and QH.209.14.M.EnvA2. The virus neutralization is a complex process and may be influenced by several factors, such as antibody titer, isotype, or antibody structure. Probably, to induce neutralizing antibodies by this peptide mixture, it is necessary to choose appropriate adjutants and immunization schedule. Moreover, it was shown that peptides could increase in vitro virus infectivity in pseudovirus-based model, using the CAP 45.2.00.G3, QH209.14M.ENV.A2, QD435.100M.ENV.E1 molecular clone. These viral isolates belong to different HIV-1 subtypes	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.midw.2016.09.005	Struggling with motherhood and coping with fatherhood – A grounded theory study among Thai teenagers	Objective to gain a deeper understanding of Thai teenage parents’ perspectives, experiences and reasoning about becoming and being a teenage parent from a gender perspective. Design an exploratory design using grounded theory methodology. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. An interview guide was developed, a pilot study was undertaken, and interviews were performed on two different occasions: once during the second trimester of pregnancy and again when the infant was 5–6 months old. Setting a province in the western part of Thailand. Participants the selection of a heterogeneous group of teenage parents-to-be continued until saturation was reached, as describe by Glaser and Strauss (1967), in all n=50. Inclusion criteria for participants were that they were heterosexual couples, under 20 years of age, cohabiting, and expecting their first child. Findings the core category ‘struggling with motherhood and coping with fatherhood’ comprises descriptions of the process from when the teenagers first learned about the pregnancy until the child was six months old. The teenagers had failed to use contraceptives which led to an unintended parenthood. Their parenthood became a turning point as the teenagers started to change their behaviours and lifestyle during pregnancy, and adapted their relationships to partner and family. Family commitments was a facilitator, through support given by their families. Finally, becoming a parent describes ways of dealing with the parental role, by engaging in parental activities and reestablishing goals in life. Most of the teenage parents reproduced traditional gender roles by being a caring mother or a breadwinning father respectively. Key conclusions ‘struggling with motherhood and coping with fatherhood’ referred to the parents’ stories about how they struggled and coped with life changes and their parental role when they became unintentionally pregnant, accepted their parenting, and finally became parents. After becoming parents, the main concerns of most of the teenage parents were being a caring mother and a breadwinning father. Implications for practice this study contributes a deeper understanding of Thai teenage parents’ experiences of becoming and being a parent and might improve health care professionals’ adaptation of care for teentranatanage parents and inspire them to tailor their care specifically to teenager's needs from early pregnancy to parenthood.</p	['SDG03']

10.1177/1363460715624455	Making the ‘modern’ family: The discourse of sexuality in the Family Planning Program in South Korea	Sexuality in the Family Planning Program (FPP) has been largely overlooked, even though the practice of birth control is inextricably connected with procreative behavior. Focusing on the sexuality discourse of the FPP in South Korea, this article examines the process of constructing an intimacy sphere and making modern families in a non-western society. The FPP was adopted as national policy and implemented by the military junta during the repressive dictatorship in the 1960 and 1970s. However, contrary to the public perception of FPP as a coercive intervention into people’s personal lives, the FPP took a critical stance regarding the repression of sexuality and stressed the pleasurable aspect of sexuality, disconnecting it from procreation and associating it with love. By analyzing this unexpected aspect, this article highlights that the emphasis on the association of sex, love and marriage was a western concept ushered into the modern Korean family in a postcolonial context. Women’s sexual desire was justified and encouraged—but conversely, women’s autonomy became bound to a sexual dimension and embedded in the marital relationship as the core of the South Korean ‘modern’ family.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1177/0956462415606341	Does service integration improve the sexual and reproductive healthcare of women living with HIV?	The sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care needs of a cohort of HIV-positive women were studied pre- and post-integration of genitourinary medicine (GUM) and SRH services. Pre-integration, 24.9% of women at risk of pregnancy were using an effective method of contraception, with a non-significant improvement post-integration to 39.3%. Pre-integration, 47.6% of pregnancies were unplanned, whilst 50% were still unplanned post-integration. Cervical cytology uptake within the previous 12 months improved significantly. It appears that the integration of services alone does not improve all aspects of the SRH of women living with HIV and additional novel strategies should be explored. </jats:p	['SDG03']

In Ghana, severe anaemia is mostly due to malaria caused by severePlasmodium falciparuminfection, road traffic accidents, and haemoglobinopathy-induced acute haemolysis.Method.This cross-sectional study evaluated coinheritance of sickle cell haemoglobin variant and G6PD enzymopathy among individuals that donated blood at the Holy Trinity Hospital, Berekum, in the Brong-Ahafo Region, Ghana. Demographic data and other pertinent information were captured using questionnaire. Sickle cell haemoglobin variants were determined using cellulose acetate electrophoresis (pH 8.6). Qualitative G6PD status and quantitative G6PD enzyme activity were determined using methaemoglobin reduction and Trinity Biotech G6PD test kit, respectively.Results.Prevalence of sickle cell trait (SCT) and G6PD enzymopathy coinheritance was 7%. In addition, 19.5% of the donors had 10%–60% of normal G6PD enzyme activity suggesting that these donor units are prone to stressor-induced acute haemolysis when given to recipients. Mild G6PD activity (p=0.03, OR: 2.410 (CI: 1.049–5.534)), commercial (p=0.020, OR: 5.609 (CI: 1.309–24.035)), and voluntary (p=0.034, OR: 2.404 (CI: 1.071–5.397)) donors were significantly associated with SCT.Conclusion.Screening for red cell pathologies must be incorporated into existing protocols for populations with high incidence of haemoglobinopathies to protect high-risk recipients.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1111/j.2041-1626.2010.00008.x	Clinical course of chronic periodontitis: effect of lifelong light smoking (20 years) on loss of attachment and teeth	Abstract  Aim:  To examine the lifelong effect of light smoking on periodontal health.    Methods:  The data were derived from a 20-year longitudinal study of a group of Norwegian, middle-class males. The patients were subset according to their smoking history. A total of 119 non-smokers and 17 smokers were examined, 20 years apart.    Results:  Current smokers had significantly higher plaque indices than non-smokers after the age of 35 years, while before 35 years, there was no difference. Before 20 years of age, the non-smokers exhibited greater gingival indices, but after the age of 35, the smokers had significantly more sites that bled upon probing. Smokers demonstrated higher mean calculus indices after 35 years and as they approached 50 years of age. At baseline, the two groups showed similar attachment loss (0.14 mm), but with increasing age and approaching 50 years, the attachment loss progressed significantly faster in smokers than in non-smokers (2.31 and 1.57 mm, respectively). Linear regression indicated that ageing and light smoking were independently and significantly related to attachment loss.    Conclusions:  Lifelong light smoking could be confirmed as a risk factor for periodontal disease progression. However, in this population, smoking did not significantly increase the risk of tooth loss	['SDG03']
10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.016	Leachate from microplastics impairs larval development in brown mussels	Microplastic debris is a pervasive type of contaminant in marine ecosystems, being considered a major threat to marine biota. One of the problems of microplastics is that they can adsorb contaminants in extremely high concentrations. When released from the particle, these contaminants have the potential to cause toxic effects in the biota. So far, reports of toxic effects are mostly linked with the direct exposure of organisms through ingestion of contaminated microplastics. There is little information on the toxicity of leachates from microplastics to marine organisms. In this study, we conducted experiments to evaluate the toxicity of leachates from virgin and beached plastic pellets to embryo development of the brown mussel (Perna pema). We compared the efficiency of two test procedures, and evaluated the toxicity of beached pellets collected in a coastal marine protected area. We observed that mussel embryo is sensitive to leachate from both virgin and beached pellets. However, the toxicity of the leachate from beached pellets was much higher than that of virgin pellets. We suggest contaminants adsorbed onto the surface of beached pellets were responsible for the high toxicity of leachate from beached pellets, while the toxicity of leachate from virgin pellets was mainly due to plastic additives. Our results suggest microplastic debris may be harmful even if ingestion is not the only or main pathway of interaction of marine organisms with contaminated plastic debris. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods  From June 2012 to June 2014, 62 patients with schizophrenia, who had recovered from a successful course of acute MECT, were recruited. Thirty-one patients received maintenance MECT and risperidone, as the experimental group. Another 31 patients were enrolled in the control group, and received risperidone only. The effects on cognitive functions, clinical symptoms and relapse rate were determined.  Results  Patients in the experimental group had a lower relapse rate and longer relapse-free survival time than the controls. Relative to the baseline evaluation, patients showed statistically significant improvement in verbal memory and visual memory. At the final assessment, the scores of verbal and visual memory were remarkably lower in the experimental group than the controls but there was no significant difference in other tests.  Conclusion  Maintenance MECT plus medication is superior to medication alone in preventing relapse and improving cognitive function	['SDG03']

Here we report two ZIKV replicon systems: a luciferase replicon that can differentiate between viral translation and RNA synthesis; and a stable luciferase replicon carrying cell line that can be used to screen and characterize inhibitors of viral replication. The transient replicon was used to evaluate the effect of an NS5 polymerase mutation on viral RNA synthesis and to analyze a known ZIKV inhibitor. The replicon cell line was developed into a 96-well format for antiviral testing. Compare with virus infection-based assay, the replicon cell line allows antiviral screening without using infectious virus. Collectively, the replicon systems have provided critical tools for both basic and translational research	['SDG03']

This was a Prospective Cohort Study commencing from July 2011 until June 2013 involving all injuries related to motor vehicle crashes (MVC) attended Emergency Departments (ED) of two tertiary centers in a district in Malaysia. Selected attributes were geospatially analyzed by using ARCGIS (by ESRI) software version 10.1 licensed to the institution and Google Map free software and multiple logistic regression was performed by using SPSS version 22.0. A total of 439 cases were recruited. The mean age (SD) of the MVC victims was 26.04 years (s.d 15.26). Male comprised of 302 (71.7%) of the cases. Motorcyclists were the commonest type of victims involved [351(80.0%)]. Hotspot MVC locations occurred at certain intersections and on roads within borough of Kenali and Binjai. The number of severely injured and polytrauma are mostly on the road network within speed limit of 60 km/hour. A person with an increase in ISS of one score had a 37 % higher odd to have disability at hospital discharge (95% CI: 1.253, 1.499, p-value &lt; 0.001). Pediatric age group (less than 19 years of age) had 52.1% lesser odds to have disability at discharge from hospital (95% CI: 0.258, 0.889, p-value &lt; 0.001) and patients who underwent operation for definitive management had 4.14 times odds to have disability at discharge from hospital (95% CI: 1.681, 10.218, p-value = 0.002). Overall this study has proven that GIS with a combination of traditional statistical analysis is still a powerful tool in road traffic injury (RTI) related research.                     </jats:p	['SDG03']

Métodos:  Estudo seccional realizado com 464 jovens de Teresina, Piauí, que finalizaram uma gravidez no primeiro quadrimestre de 2006 em seis maternidades do município, com faixa etária entre 15 e 19 anos. Os dados foram coletados de maio a dezembro de 2008, no domicílio das jovens após sua identificação nos registros das maternidades. Para a análise univariada dos dados, utilizou-se a estatística descritiva, e para a análise bivariada empregou-se o teste do χ2 de Pearson e o teste Z. A análise multivariada se deu por meio da Regressão Logística Múltipla (RLM), sendo empregado um nível de significância de 5%.  Resultados:  As jovens que tiveram mais de uma gestação foram quase nove vezes mais propensas a abortar quando comparadas àquelas que haviam vivenciado apenas uma gestação (p = 0,002). Além disso, as jovens que referiram ter sido pressionadas pelo parceiro a abortar eram quatro vezes e meia mais propensas a consumar o ato quando comparadas aos casos em que a pressão advinha de parentes e amigos do casal (p = 0,007).  Conclusão:  As jovens que vivenciaram duas ou mais gestações, e que sofreram pressão do companheiro para abortar, eram mais propensas a praticar o aborto. Assim, faz-se necessário que programas de Planejamento Familiar incluam, com maior profundidade, o público adolescente, com vistas a evitar gestações indesejadas nesta população e, consequentemente, o aborto induzido sob condições precárias	['SDG03']

However the problem of the turnover of substandard and fake drug and their destruction in the Russian Federation is still urgent. The aim of the study: to evaluate the effectiveness of state quality control over medicine and the practice of fake medicine destruction. Methods: data of the official websites of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the Republic of North Ossetia — Alania, Russian Sanitary Inspection, National Center of Quality control and Certification of Drugs were included in the investigation. Method of unrepeated samples was used in sociological investigations. 225 questionnaires have been worked out. The research was carried out in the North-Ossetian State Medical academy during the period from 2013 to 2015 with the help of the National Center of Quality Control and Certification of Drugs. Results: The shortcomings of the state quality control over the rules of fake drug destruction were studied. It was found out that the mechanism of permanent data collection monitoring of revealing, moving and destruction of substandard and fake drug destruction has not been determined. The ineffectiveness of controlling measures under the condition of critical legal base deficiency has been confirmed. The analysis of terminology characterizing the order of fake drug destruction was carried out. Conclusion: deficiencies related to the implementation of the state quality control over the fake drug destruction rules revealed during the course of investigations prove the necessity of adopting measures in creating new model of control functions, increasing the results of activity.Современная система государственного контроля качества лекарственных средств позволяет выявлять и изымать из обращения лекарственные препараты (ЛП), не соответствующие установленным требованиям. Однако проблема оборота недоброкачественных, контрафактных и фальсифицированных лекарств и их уничтожения в Российской Федерации (РФ) по-прежнему актуальна. Цель исследования: провести оценку эффективности государственного контроля качества ЛП и сложившейся в РФ практики соблюдения субъектами обращения ЛП правил их уничтожения. Методы: в исследование включали данные официальных сайтов Министерства здравоохранения РФ и Республики Северная Осетия-Алания (РСО-Алания), Росздравнадзора, ГБУЗ «Республиканский центр контроля качества и сертификации лекарственных средств» Минздрава РСО-Алания (РЦККиСЛС).

This study sought to assess the malaria reporting and epidemic preparedness systems of health facilities in Eldoret West District, Kenya. A crosssectional study design was adapted. A census technique was used to select all the forty five health facilities in the district comprising of government, mission and non-governmental facilities. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used for data collection and analysis done using Stata. Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and corresponding percentages. The overall reporting rate was 91.7% for all the health facilities. Only 15 health facilities (33%) plotted malaria trend lines for number of cases of malaria. Malaria epidemics were reported within 24 hours in 22 health facilities but they lacked the appropriate supplies to respond to confirmed cases or epidemics. The overall malaria reporting completeness rate was above 90% implying that the malaria surveillance system was generally good. Concerted efforts by concerned stakeholders should ensure improvement of malaria epidemic preparedness system in all health facilities and provision of information to health personnel on malaria outbreak response strategies	['SDG03']

We investigated whether or not polyphenols could confer a protective potential against alcohol-induced oxidative stress. Methods We administered (per os) for two months 20 mg/kg of olive polyphenols containing mostly hydroxytyrosol in alcoholic adult male mice. Hydroxytyrosol metabolites as hydroxytyrosol sulfate 1 and hydroxytyrosol sulfate 2 were found in the serum of mice administered with polyphenols with the highest amount in animals treated with both polyphenols and alcohol. Oxidative stress was evaluated by FORT (free oxygen radical test) and FORD (free oxygen radical defense) tests. Results Alcoholic mice showed a worse oxidative status than nonalcoholic mice (higher FORT and lower FORD) but polyphenol supplementation partially counteracted the alcohol pro-oxidant effects, as evidenced by FORT. Conclusions A better understanding of the antioxidant protection provided by polyphenols might be of primary interest for drug discovery and dietary-based prevention of the damage associated with chronic alcohol abus	['SDG03']

Módszer: A három megyében valamennyi, 2006 és 2010 között bekövetkezett halálesetet vizsgálták. A halottvizsgálati bizonyítványok tekintetében  rögzítették  az  alapbetegséget,  a  közvetlen  halálokot,  a  halálozás  jellegét,  valamint  a  halottvizsgálatot  kitöltő orvos kapcsolatát a halálesettel. Eredmények:A boncolások mellőzésének kérdésében a három megyében jelentős különbségek adódtak, attól függően, hogy ki töltötte ki a halottvizsgálati bizonyítványt. Az erőszakos halálesetek körébe sorolható baleseti jellegű halálozás esetén 844 esetben, nem meghatározott sérüléses mechanizmus esetén 28 esetben mellőzték a boncolást. Öngyilkosság esetén 25 esetben, emberölés tekintetében egy esetben nem került sor  boncolásra.  Következtetések:A  magyarországi  jogszabályok  szerint  minden  olyan  esetben,  amikor  a  halál  nem  természetes vagy kétséges, hogy természetes úton állt be, hatósági vagy igazságügyi orvosi boncolást kell végezni.

Using a sample of 248,922 Americans recruited via the Project Implicit website, we tested whether implicit attitudes toward gay men and lesbians shifted as a result of the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak. Regression discontinuity analyses, but not t-tests, showed evidence of a small shift in implicit (but not explicit) attitudes at the height of public concern over Ebola. These results could be interpreted as providing partial support for the effects of naturally occurring pathogen threats on social attitudes. Alternatively, given the large size of our sample, the mixed evidence and small effects may reflect a boundary condition for the operation of the behavioral immune system. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.5858/arpa.2016-0382-ra	Zika virus infection in pregnancy, microcephaly, and maternal and fetal health: What we think, what we know, and what we think we know	Context.—The global epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has emerged as an important public health problem affecting pregnant women and their infants.                Objectives.—To review the causal association between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and intrauterine fetal infection, microcephaly, brain damage, congenital malformation syndrome, and experimental laboratory models of fetal infection. Many questions remain regarding the risk factors, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and timing of maternal-fetal transmission and disease. These include mechanisms of fetal brain damage and microcephaly; the role of covariables, such as viral burden, duration of viremia, and host genetics, on vertical transmission; and the clinical and pathologic spectrum of congenital Zika syndrome. Additional questions include defining the potential long-term physical and neurobehavioral outcomes for infected infants, whether maternal or fetal host genetics influence the clinical outcome, and whether ZIKV infection can cause maternal morbidity. Finally, are experimental laboratory and animal models of ZIKV infection helpful in addressing maternal-fetal viral transmission and the development of congenital microcephaly? This communication provides current information and attempts to address some of these important questions.                Data Sources.—Comprehensive review of published scientific literature.                Conclusions.—Recent advances in epidemiology, clinical medicine, pathology, and experimental studies have provided a great amount of new information regarding vertical ZIKV transmission and the mechanisms of congenital microcephaly, brain damage, and congenital Zika syndrome in a relatively short time. However, much work still needs to be performed to more completely understand the maternal and fetal aspects of this new and emerging viral disease.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1111/ijcp.12900	Benefits of quitting smoking on work productivity and activity impairment in the United States, the European Union and China	BACKGROUND: Smoking has important health and economic consequences for individuals and society. This study expands the understanding of work‐related burden associated with smoking and benefit of smoking cessation across the US, European Union (EU) and China using large‐scale, representative survey methodology. METHODS: Data utilised the 2013 National Health and Wellness Survey in United States (US), EU5 (UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and China. Working‐aged respondents 18‐64 were used in the analyses (US N=58 500; EU5 N=50 417; China N=17 987) and were categorised into: current smokers, trying to quit, former smokers and never smokers. Generalised linear models controlling for demographics and health characteristics examined the relationship of smoking status with work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI‐GH). The WPAI‐GH measures were: absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment. Separately, current smokers were compared with those who quit 0‐4, 5‐10 and 11 or more years ago on WPAI‐GH end‐points. RESULTS: Current smokers reported greater absenteeism in the US and China and greater presenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment than former and never smokers across the three regions. Those who quit even 0‐4 years ago demonstrated lower absenteeism, presenteeism, and activity impairment in China and lower presenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment in the US and EU5. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking was associated with significant work productivity loss in the US, EU5 and China. The results suggest that quitting benefits extend to work productivity rapidly after cessation, serving to further encourage and promote the implementation of workplace cessation programs	['SDG03']

The best way to control outbreaks is vaccination. Currently, conventionally modified-live and inactivated vaccines are commercially available, which have been successfully used to control BT, but nonetheless have their specific shortcomings. Therefore, there is a need for improved BT vaccines.The ideal BT vaccine is efficacious, safe, affordable, protective against multiple serotypes and enables the differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals. Different field situations require specific vaccine profiles. Single serotype outbreaks in former BT-free areas need rapid onset of protection against viremia of the respective serotype. In contrary, endemic multiple serotype situations require long-lasting protection against all circulating serotypes. The ideal BT vaccine for all field situations does not exist and balancing between vaccine properties is needed.Many new vaccines candidates, ranging from non-replicating subunits to replicating next-generation reverse genetics based vaccines, have been developed. Some have been tested extensively in large numbers of ruminants, whereas others were developed recently and have only been tested in vitro and in mice models. Most vaccine candidates are promising, but have their specific shortcomings and advantages. In this review, current and next-generation BT vaccines are discussed in the light of prerequisites for different field situations	['SDG03']

Métodos:  Estudo não controlado, do tipo antes-e-depois, que avaliou a mudança ocorrida entre os anos 2004 e 2012, após as intervenções propostas pelo Comitê Municipal de Investigação de Óbitos Infantis, Fetais e de Morte Materna (COMAI) na cidade de Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, na frequência de indicadores de processo de melhoria na assistência perinatal. Foram estudados 254 pacientes no ano de 2004 e 259 no ano de 2012.  Resultados:  Foi observado aumento de 65% na frequência do uso de corticoide pré-natal entre gestantes em trabalho de parto prematuro com idade gestacional ≤ 34 semanas (frequência de uso de 38,0 e 62,8% em 2004 e 2012, respectivamente; p < 0,001) e de 35% no uso de surfactante entre recém-nascidos ≤ 34 semanas de idade gestacional (41,3 e 55,6% em 2004 e 2012, respectivamente; p = 0,025), assim como uma redução de 16% na presença de hipotermia (70,8 e 59,4% em 2004 e 2012, respectivamente; p = 0,009) na admissão à unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal.  Conclusão:  Houve melhora em algumas das práticas de assistência pré-natal e neonatal. Ao final do período estudado, as frequências de uso de corticoide pré-natal e de surfactante foram menores do que as relatadas internacionalmente. No mesmo sentido, a frequência de hipotermia na admissão à unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal foi maior do que a observada em países desenvolvidos	['SDG03']

10.1177/0956462416638224	Syphilis incidence among men who have sex with men in China: results from a meta-analysis	The recent upsurge of syphilis infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) is one of the major challenges facing China. However, the overall burden is still not clear. This study aims to summarize the incidence of syphilis among MSM in China by using meta-analysis. We comprehensively searched PubMed-MEDLINE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese Wanfang databases. Articles published between December 2009 and March 2015 that met the inclusion criteria were considerably involved in this meta-analysis. Two reviewers performed a quality assessment of the studies and extracted data for estimating the overall syphilis incidence. STATA 12.0 was used to summarize the overall incidence of syphilis. In all, 14 studies from 13 papers were included in this study. Follow-up duration of these studies ranged from six to 36 months, while drop-out rates ranged from 11.9% to 83.6%. The individual incidence rates of the included studies varied from 3.1/100 person-years (95% CI, 0.8–5.3/100 person-years) to 38.5/100 person-years (95% CI, 28.9–48.1/100 person-years), with a pooled incidence of 9.6/100 person-years (95% CI, 7.0–12.2/100 person-years). The subgroup meta-analysis revealed that incidence estimates were 38.5/100 person-years (95% CI, 28.9–48.1/100 person-years), 12.1/100 person-years (95% CI, 7.0–17.2/100 person-years), 11.2/100 person-years (95% CI, 0.7–23.1/100 person-years), 8.9/100 person-years (95% CI, 6.5–11.2/100 person-years), 5.7/100 person-years (95% CI, 3.4–8.0/100 person-years) and 3.1/100 person-years (95% CI, 0.8–5.3/100 person-years) in Northeast, North, Southwest, East, South and Northwest China, respectively. Syphilis incidence among Chinese MSM is high, and this may increase the spread of other sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus. It is essential to integrate syphilis control programs with HIV control programs. This can be achieved by establishing public health response systems to monitor and control the epidemic of syphilis and HIV together in China	['SDG03']

10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053305	Global economic cost of smoking-attributable diseases	BACKGROUND - The detrimental impact of smoking on health has been widely documented since the 1960s. Numerous studies have also quantified the economic cost that smoking imposes on society. However, these studies have mostly been in high income countries, with limited documentation from developing countries. The aim of this paper is to measure the economic cost of smoking-attributable diseases in countries throughout the world, including in low- and middle-income settings.    METHODS - The Cost of Illness approach is used to estimate the economic cost of smoking attributable-diseases in 2012. Under this approach, economic costs are defined as either 'direct costs' such as hospital fees or 'indirect costs' representing the productivity loss from morbidity and mortality. The same method was applied to 152 countries, which had all the necessary data, representing 97% of the world's smokers.    FINDINGS - The amount of healthcare expenditure due to smoking-attributable diseases totalled purchasing power parity (PPP) $467 billion (US$422 billion) in 2012, or 5.7% of global health expenditure. The total economic cost of smoking (from health expenditures and productivity losses together) totalled PPP $1852 billion (US$1436 billion) in 2012, equivalent in magnitude to 1.8% of the world's annual gross domestic product (GDP). Almost 40% of this cost occurred in developing countries, highlighting the substantial burden these countries suffer.    CONCLUSIONS - Smoking imposes a heavy economic burden throughout the world, particularly in Europe and North America, where the tobacco epidemic is most advanced. These findings highlight the urgent need for countries to implement stronger tobacco control measures to address these costs	['SDG03']

10.5603/arm.2017.0003	E-smoking among students of medicine — frequency, pattern and motivations	Introduction: E-smoking has become a public health problem. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette use; to compare the patterns of smoking; to assess the attitudes and motivations for e-cigarette use. Material and methods: All 1700 students from Faculty of Medicine (Medical University of Silesia) were invited to questionnaire based cross-sectional study about the frequency and attitudes towards the use of traditional and electronic cigarettes. Results: The data were obtained from 1318 medical students (response 77.5%) aged 22.1 ± 2.2 years. Traditional tobacco smoked 18.1%, e-cigarettes 1.3% and 2.2% were dual smokers. The overall frequency of e-smokers was 4.9% among men and 2.8% among women (p = 0.05). Compared to tobacco users in e-smokers duration of smoking was shorter (p &lt; 0.001), the intensity of smoking was larger (p = 0.01), the number of e-cigarettes smoked daily was higher (p &lt; 0.001). Dual smokers more frequently used tobacco cigarettes than e-cigarettes (p = 0.01) but smoked more e-cigarettes daily (p = 0.003). The choice of e-liquid depended on the flavour (50.0%), nicotine concentration (21.7%) and price (7.6%). No-nicotine e-cigarettes were used by 6.5% smokers. Dual smokers more frequently chose e-liquids with high nicotine concentration (p = 0.01). Motivations leading to e-smoking were: quitting tobacco (58.7%), less harmful impact on health (43.5%) and the price (34.8%). E-smoking as safe for health was perceived by 6.0% of respondents (35.5% in e-smokers vs. 4.9% in non e-smokers; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Among students of medicine, e-smoking is apparently less popular than smoking tobacco cigarettes. Respondents considered e-cigarettes to be harmful and addictive.</jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1071/sh16056	Enhanced use of phylogenetic data to inform public health approaches to HIV among men who have sex with men	The multidimensional nature and continued evolution of HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) requires innovative intervention approaches. Strategies are needed that recognise the individual, social and structural factors driving HIV transmission; that can pinpoint networks with heightened transmission risk; and that can help target intervention in real time. HIV phylogenetics is a rapidly evolving field with strong promise for informing innovative responses to the HIV epidemic among MSM. Currently, HIV phylogenetic insights are providing new understandings of characteristics of HIV epidemics involving MSM, social networks influencing transmission, characteristics of HIV transmission clusters involving MSM, targets for antiretroviral and other prevention strategies and dynamics of emergent epidemics. Maximising the potential of HIV phylogenetics for HIV responses among MSM will require attention to key methodological challenges and ethical considerations, as well as resolving key implementation and scientific questions. Enhanced and integrated use of HIV surveillance, sociobehavioural and phylogenetic data resources are becoming increasingly critical for informing public health approaches to HIV among MSM. </jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1038/mp.2017.5	Genetic contributions to self-reported tiredness	Abstract           Self-reported tiredness and low energy, often called fatigue, are associated with poorer physical and mental health. Twin studies have indicated that this has a heritability between 6 and 50%. In the UK Biobank sample (N=108 976), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of responses to the question, ‘Over the last two weeks, how often have you felt tired or had little energy?’ Univariate GCTA-GREML found that the proportion of variance explained by all common single-nucleotide polymorphisms for this tiredness question was 8.4% (s.e.=0.6%). GWAS identified one genome-wide significant hit (Affymetrix id 1:64178756_C_T; P=1.36 × 10−11). Linkage disequilibrium score regression and polygenic profile score analyses were used to test for shared genetic aetiology between tiredness and up to 29 physical and mental health traits from GWAS consortia. Significant genetic correlations were identified between tiredness and body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, forced expiratory volume, grip strength, HbA1c, longevity, obesity, self-rated health, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist–hip ratio, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, neuroticism, schizophrenia and verbal-numerical reasoning (absolute r             g effect sizes between 0.02 and 0.78). Significant associations were identified between tiredness phenotypic scores and polygenic profile scores for BMI, HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein, HbA1c, height, obesity, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist–hip ratio, childhood cognitive ability, neuroticism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia (standardised β’s had absolute values&lt;0.03). These results suggest that tiredness is a partly heritable, heterogeneous and complex phenomenon that is phenotypically and genetically associated with affective, cognitive, personality and physiological processes.</jats:p	['SDG03']

In order to shed light on the status of surveillance in countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region outside of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), we surveyed 18 countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Among the 10 countries that responded, the common features of many surveillance systems included mandatory surveillance, passive case-finding and the reporting of both acute and chronic HBV and HCV. Only some countries had surveillance systems that incorporated the tracking of associated conditions and outcomes such as cirrhosis and liver transplantation. Screening programmes for some key populations appeared to be in place in many countries, but there may be gaps in relation to screening programmes for people who inject drugs, prisoners, sex workers and men who have sex with men. Nonetheless, important components of a surveillance structure are in place in the responding study countries. It is advisable to build on this structure to develop harmonised HBV and HCV surveillance for all 53 Member States of the WHO European Region following the example of the system recently instituted in EU/EEA countries.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1093/molbev/msw217	Phylogenetic tools for generalized HIV-1 epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV methods comparison	Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modelling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first three months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention	['SDG03']

10.4102/jsava.v87i1.1391	Eco-epidemiological and pathological features of wildlife mortality events related to cyanobacterial biointoxication in the kruger national park, South Africa	Over the past decade, several clustered, multispecies, wildlife mortality events occurred in the vicinity of two man-made earthen dams in the southern and south central regions of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. On field investigation, heavy cyanobacterial blooms were visible in these impoundments and analysis of water samples showed the dominance of Microcystis spp. (probably Microcystis aeruginosa). Macroscopic lesions seen at necropsy and histopathological lesions were compatible with a diagnosis of cyanobacterial intoxication. Laboratory toxicity tests and assays also confirmed the presence of significant levels of microcystins in water from the two dams. These outbreaks occurred during the dry autumn and early winter seasons when water levels in these dams were dropping, and a common feature was that all the affected dams were supporting a large number of hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius). It is hypothesised that hippopotamus’ urine and faeces, together with agitation of the sediments, significantly contributed to internal loading of phosphates and nitrogen – leading to eutrophication of the water in these impoundments and subsequent cyanobacterial blooms. A major cause for concern was that a number of white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) were amongst the victims of these bio-intoxication events. This publication discusses the eco-epidemiology and pathology of these clustered mortalities, as well as the management options considered and eventually used to address the problem	['SDG03']

Treatments that help patients successfully quit smoking have an important effect on health and life expectancy. Varenicline is a medication that can help smokers successfully quit smoking. However, there are concerns that it may cause adverse effects, such as increase in the occurrence of depression, self-harm and suicide and cardiovascular disease. In this study we aim to examine the effects of varenicline versus other smoking cessation pharmacotherapies on smoking cessation, health service use, all-cause and cause-specific mortality and physical and mental health conditions.METHODS: In this project we will investigate the effects of varenicline compared to nicotine replacement therapies on: (1) long-term smoking cessation and whether these effects differ by area level deprivation; and (2) the following clinically-important outcomes: rate of general practice and hospital attendance; all-cause mortality and death due to diseases of the respiratory system and cardiovascular disease; and a primary care diagnosis of respiratory illness, myocardial infarction or depression and anxiety. The study is based on a cohort of patients prescribed these smoking cessation medications from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We will use three methods to overcome confounding: multivariable adjusted Cox regression, propensity score matched Cox regression, and instrumental variable regression. The total expected sample size for analysis will be at least 180,000. Follow-up will end with the earliest of either an 'event' or censoring due to the end of registration or death.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was not required for this study. This project has been approved by the CPRD's Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC). We will disseminate our findings via publications in international peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conferences.</p	['SDG03']

SETTING: 545 communities from 17 high-income, upper-middle, low-middle and low-income countries (HIC, UMIC, LMIC, LIC) involved in the Environmental Profile of a Community's Health (EPOCH) study from 2009 to 2014. PARTICIPANTS: Community audits and surveys of adults (35–70 years, n=12 953). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Summary scores of tobacco policy implementation (cost and availability of cigarettes, tobacco advertising, antismoking signage), social unacceptability and knowledge were associated with quit ratios (former vs ever smokers) using multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: Average tobacco control policy score was greater in communities from HIC. Overall 56.1% (306/545) of communities had >2 outlets selling cigarettes and in 28.6% (154/539) there was access to cheap cigarettes (<5cents/cigarette) (3.2% (3/93) in HIC, 0% UMIC, 52.6% (90/171) LMIC and 40.4% (61/151) in LIC). Effective bans (no tobacco advertisements) were in 63.0% (341/541) of communities (81.7% HIC, 52.8% UMIC, 65.1% LMIC and 57.6% LIC). In 70.4% (379/538) of communities, >80% of participants disapproved youth smoking (95.7% HIC, 57.6% UMIC, 76.3% LMIC and 58.9% LIC). The average knowledge score was >80% in 48.4% of communities (94.6% HIC, 53.6% UMIC, 31.8% LMIC and 35.1% LIC). Summary scores of policy implementation, social unacceptability and knowledge were positively and significantly associated with quit ratio and the associations varied by gender, for example, communities in the highest quintile of the combined scores had 5.0 times the quit ratio in men (Odds ratio (OR) 5·0, 95% CI 3.4 to 7.4) and 4.1 times the quit ratio in women (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.4 to 7.1). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that more focus is needed on ensuring the tobacco control policy is actually implemented, particularly in LMICs. The gender-related differences in associations of policy, social unacceptability and knowledge suggest that different strategies to promoting quitting may need to be implemented in men compared to women	['SDG03']

10.1111/disa.12238	Political drivers of epidemic response: foreign healthcare workers and the 2014 Ebola outbreak	This study demonstrates that countries responded quite differently to calls for healthcare workers (HCWs) during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014. Using a new dataset on the scale and timing of national pledges and the deployment of HCWs to states experiencing outbreaks of the virus disease (principally, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), it shows that few foreign nations deployed HCWs early, some made pledges but then fulfilled them slowly, and most sent no HCWs at all. To aid understanding of such national responses, the paper reviews five theoretical perspectives that offer potentially competing or complementary explanations of foreign government medical assistance for international public health emergencies. The study systematically validates that countries varied greatly in whether and when they addressed HCW deployment needs during the Ebola crisis of 2014, and offers suggestions for a theory-driven inquiry to elucidate the logics of foreign interventions in critical infectious disease epidemics.</p	['SDG03']
10.1038/s41598-017-01135-2	Efficacy of Recent Emissions Controls on Road Vehicles in Europe and Implications for Public Health	AbstractRoad traffic is a major source of urban air pollution responsible for substantial premature mortality. Until recently, attention has focussed primarily on exhaust emissions of particulate matter from traffic as a causal factor. From analysis of air quality measurement data from the UK and France, we demonstrate that road traffic exhaust has a far greater impact on concentrations of nitrogen dioxide than of PM2.5. PM2.5 and carbonaceous particle concentrations have been declining appreciably since 2010/11 due to the use of diesel particle filters, but little change is seen in nitrogen dioxide over the period from 1995 to 2015. It is shown that the effect of NO2 from road traffic upon premature mortality was ten-fold greater than that of PM2.5 even before the widespread use of diesel particle filters, and is now considerably larger. The overwhelming contribution of diesel compared to gasoline-fuelled vehicles to emissions of both PM2.5 and NO2 emphasises the importance of further controls on emissions from diesels.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Despite this, many organizations are unaware of the factors within their organizations that are likely to influence potential reductions in work-related road traffic injury. Methods: This article presents a multilevel conceptual framework that identifies health investment as the central feature in reducing work-related road traffic injury. Within this framework, we explore factors operating at the individual driver, workgroup supervisor, and organizational senior management levels that create a mutually reinforcing system of safety. Results: The health investment framework identifies key factors at the senior manager, supervisor, and driver levels to cultivating a safe working environment. These factors are high-performance workplace systems, leader–member exchange and autonomy, trust and empowerment, respectively. The framework demonstrates the important interactions between these factors and how they create a self-sustaining organizational safety system. Conclusions: The framework aims to provide insight into the future development of interventions that are strategically aligned with the organization and target elements that facilitate and enhance driver safety and ultimately reduce work-related road traffic injury and death.</p	['SDG03']

In Pakistan, injection drug users (IDUs) constitute the core risk group of HIV prevalence, where the epidemic has transitioned to a “concentrated level.” Still nothing is known about the role of knowledge in HIV transmission and HIV sero-conversion among IDUs in Pakistan. Methods: From 2009 to 2011, a nested case–control study was conducted in a cohort of 636 IDUs receiving harm reduction services in the mega city of Karachi. Results: In multivariable regression analysis, 3 factors, namely HIV does not spread through unprotected sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-6.90, P value .01), HIV does not transmit by sharing syringes (AOR: 3.5, 95% CI 1.97-6.40, P value &lt;.00), and the risk of HIV cannot be minimized by using new syringe every time (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI 1.16-3.60, P value .01), were significantly associated with the incident cases of HIV. Conclusion: The study findings suggest the association between knowledge of HIV transmission and HIV sero-incident cases. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

10.3390/ijerph14050528	Family planning and the Samburu: A qualitative study exploring the thoughts of men on a population health and environment programme in rural Kenya	Population Health and Environment (PHE) strategies are argued to improve ecosystem and human health by addressing family size and its effects on natural resource use, food security, and reproductive health. This study investigates men’s views on a PHE family planning (FP) programme delivered among the pastoral Samburu tribe in rural northern Kenya. Three focus group discussions and nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 Samburu men. These discussions revealed support for environmentally-sensitised family planning promotion. Men highlighted their dependency on natural resources and challenges faced in providing for large families and maintaining livestock during drought. These practices were said to lead to natural resource exhaustion, environmental degradation, and wildlife dispersal, undermining key economic benefits of environmental and wildlife conservation. Relating family size to the environment is a compelling strategy to improve support for FP among Samburu men. Kenyan policy-makers should consider integrating community-based PHE strategies among underserved pastoral groups living in fragile ecosystems	['SDG03']

10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000065	‘Women and babies are dying but not of Ebola’: The effect of the Ebola virus epidemic on the availability, uptake and outcomes of maternal and newborn health services in Sierra Leone	BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the impact of the Ebola virus epidemic on the availability, uptake and outcome of routine maternity services in Sierra Leone. METHODS: The number of antenatal and postnatal visits, institutional births, availability of emergency obstetric care (EmOC), maternal deaths and stillbirths were assessed by month, by districts and by level of healthcare for 10 months during, and 12 months prior to, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic. All healthcare facilities designated to provide comprehensive (n=13) or basic (n=67) EmOC across the 13 districts of Sierra Leone were included. RESULTS: Preservice students were not deployed during the EVD epidemic. The number of healthcare providers in facilities remained constant (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.07). Availability of antibiotics, oxytocics, anticonvulsants, manual removal of placenta, removal of retained products of conception, blood transfusion and caesarean section were not affected by the EVD epidemic. Across Sierra Leone, following the onset of the EVD epidemic, there was a 18% decrease in the number of women attending for antenatal (IRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.84); 22% decrease in postnatal attendance (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.80) visits and 11% decrease in the number of women attending for birth at a healthcare facility (IRR 0.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.91). There was a corresponding 34% increase in the facility maternal mortality ratio (IRR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.69) and 24% increase in the stillbirth rate (IRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: During the EVD epidemic, fewer pregnant women accessed healthcare. For those who did, an increase in maternal mortality and stillbirth was observed. In the post-Ebola phase, ‘readiness’ (or not) of the global partners for large-scale epidemics has been the focus of debate. The level of functioning of the health system with regard to ability to continue to provide high-quality effective routine care needs more attention	['SDG03']

10.14689/ejer.2017.68.4	Effect of health warnings on cigarette pockets on behaviour: Educational perspective	Purpose: Health warnings printed on cigarette packets are an important vehicle in that they demonstrate and inform people of the threats and health risks related to smoking. Increasing the effectiveness of this vehicle is one of the purposes of this study. Research Methods: Since this research aims to describe the associations between dependent and independent variables and determine whether or not independent variables influence dependent variables, it is a correlational study in the category of descriptive research. The research group was composed of 848 randomly chosen undergraduate students. The data were collected through a questionnaire used in similar research. Path analysis and logistic regression analysis were employed in the analysis of the data. Findings: According to the findings, the variables of response efficacy, self-efficacy, probability of harm and the severity of harm have high rates of explanation in both groups, but are higher in the combined warning group. It is apparent that the severity of harm and probability of harm will not be influential in behaviours in both groups without the variable of the instrument of fear. The reason for this is that fear can be associated with the function of the moderator. Implications for Research and Practice: In conclusion, it may be stated that the written text warnings and combined warnings printed on cigarette packets can be influential (and combined warnings are more influential) in preventing individuals from smoking. Enlarging this project and applying it to different groups is important in terms of understanding the durability of the relevant behaviour.Scopu	['SDG03']

10.1186/s12913-017-2235-y	The development and appraisal of a tool designed to find patients harmed by falsely labelled, falsified (counterfeit) medicines	"To access publisher's full text version of this article, please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links field or click on the hyperlink at the top of the page marked FilesFalsely labelled, falsified (counterfeit) medicines (FFCm's) are produced or distributed illegally and can harm patients. Although the occurrence of FFCm's is increasing in Europe, harm is rarely reported. The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Health-Care (EDQM) has therefore coordinated the development and validation of a screening tool.The tool consists of a questionnaire referring to a watch-list of FFCm's identified in Europe, including symptoms of their use and individual risk factors, and a scoring form. To refine the questionnaire and reference method, a pilot-study was performed in 105 self-reported users of watch-list medicines. Subsequently, the tool was validated under ""real-life conditions"" in 371 patients in 5 ambulatory and in-patient care sites (""sub-studies""). The physicians participating in the study scored the patients and classified their risk of harm as ""unlikely"" or ""probable"" (cut-off level: presence of ≥2 of 5 risk factors). They assessed all medical records retrospectively (independent reference method) to validate the risk classification and documented their perception of the tool's value.In 3 ambulatory care sites (180 patients), the tool correctly classified 5 patients as harmed by FFCm's. The positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+/LR-) and the discrimination power were calculated for two cut-off levels: a) 1 site (50 patients): presence of two risk factors (at 10% estimated health care system contamination with FFCm's): LR + 4.9/LR-0, post-test probability: 35%; b) 2 sites (130 patients): presence of three risk factors (at 5% estimated prevalence of use of non-prescribed medicines (FFCm's) by certain risk groups): LR + 9.7/LR-0, post-test probability: 33%. In 2 in-patient care sites (191 patients), no patient was confirmed as harmed by FFCm's. The physicians perceived the tool as valuable for finding harm, and as an information source regarding risk factors.This ""decision aid"" is a systematic tool which helps find in medical practice patients harmed by FFCm's. This study supports its value in ambulatory care in regions with health care system contamination and in certain risk groups. The establishment of systematic communication between authorities and the medical community concerning FFCm's, current patterns of use and case reports may sustain positive public health impacts.EDQ"	['SDG03']

Employing nationally recognized tobacco-free policy strategies, steps toward implementation were tailored to addictions treatment settings. Census data and survey of client tobacco use data were collected for 1 year before the policy began and for 1 year following the policy. Average daily census increased for both the inpatient and extended residential treatment programs after enactment of the tobacco-free policy. Number of tobacco users admitted to treatment increased significantly, while the number of tobacco users who left treatment early did not significantly change. In addition to reducing smoking, the policy was associated with a significant increase of patients reporting the intention to remain abstinent after discharge. Contrary to common concern, a tobacco-free policy implemented in an inpatient residential addictions treatment setting did not negatively affect census rates. This study suggests potential clinical and organizational benefits for campus-wide tobacco-free policies. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.3747/co.23.3506	Lessons learned implementing a province-wide smoking cessation initiative in Ontario’s cancer centres	Purpose: A large body of evidence clearly shows that cancer patients experience significant health benefits with smoking cessation. Cancer Care Ontario, the provincial agency responsible for the quality of cancer services in Ontario, has undertaken a province-wide smoking cessation initiative. The strategies used, the results achieved, and the lessons learned are the subject of the present article. Methods: Evidence related to the health benefits of smoking cessation in cancer patients was reviewed. A steering committee developed a vision statement for the initiative, created a framework for implementation, and made recommendations for the key elements of the initiative and for smoking cessation best practices. Results: New ambulatory cancer patients are being screened for their smoking status in each of Ontario’s 14 regional cancer centres. Current or recent smokers are advised of the benefits of cessation and are directed to smoking cessation resources as appropriate. Performance metrics are captured and used to drive improvement through quarterly performance reviews and provincial rankings of the regional cancer centres. Conclusions: Regional smoking cessation champions, commitment from Cancer Care Ontario senior leadership, a provincial secretariat, and guidance from smoking cessation experts have been important enablers of early success. Data capture has been difficult because of the variety of information systems in use and non-standardized administrative and clinical processes. Numerous challenges remain, including increasing physician engagement; obtaining funding for key program elements, including in-house resources to support smoking cessation; and overcoming financial barriers to access nicotine replacement therapy. Future efforts will focus on standardizing processes to the extent possible, while tailoring the approaches to the populations served and the resources available within the individual regional cancer programs.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Therefore, engaging them in treatment is an important aspect of evidence-based care. OBJECTIVE: To use the theory of planned behavior to examine factors associated with intentions to provide and the provision of evidence-based tobacco treatment. DESIGN: This study is based on a cross-sectional analysis of survey data from 195 staff at a state psychiatric hospital. Results: When controlling for demographic variables, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control toward providing tobacco treatment were associated with intentions to provide tobacco treatment, but only subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were associated with reported provision of evidence-based tobacco treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding factors that influence provider delivery of tobacco treatment can better determine strategies to reduce the disproportionate tobacco use and related illnesses in behavioral health settings. </jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1093/eurpub/ckw265	Parental separation in childhood and adult smoking in the 1958 British birth cohort	BACKGROUND:  Parental separation or divorce is a known risk factor for poorer adult health. One mechanism may operate through the uptake of risky health behaviours, such as smoking. This study investigated the association between parental separation and adult smoking in a large British birth cohort and also examined potential socioeconomic, relational and psychosocial mediators. Differences by gender and timing of parental separation were also assessed.  METHODS:  Multiply imputed data on 11 375 participants of the National Child Development Study (the 1958 British birth cohort) were used. A series of multinomial logistic regression models were estimated to investigate the association between parental separation (0–16 years) and adult smoking status (age 42), and the role of potential socioeconomic, relational and psychosocial mediators.  RESULTS:  Parental separation in childhood was associated with an increased risk of being a current (RRR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.77, 2.60) or ex-smoker (RRR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.85) at age 42. This association remained after consideration of potential socioeconomic, psychosocial and relational mediators. Relational (parent–child relationship quality, parental involvement and adult partnership status) and socioeconomic factors (overcrowding, financial hardship, housing tenure, household amenities, free school meal receipt and educational attainment) appeared to be the most important of the groups of mediators investigated. No differences by gender or the timing of parental separation were observed.  CONCLUSION:  Parental separation experienced in childhood was associated with increased risk of smoking. Families undergoing separation should be further supported in order to prevent the uptake of smoking and to prevent later health problems	['SDG03']

10.1155/2017/9241238	Predictors for Mortality among Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Tanzania	Problem. Factors related to MDRTB mortality in Tanzania have not been adequately explored and reported. Objectives. To determine demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory factors associated with MDRTB mortality in a Tanzanian TB Referral Hospital. Methodology. This was a cross-sectional study with 193 participants. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected, and their associations with mortality among MDRTB patients were determined. Results and Conclusions. Cough was the commonest finding among these MDRTB patients, with 179 (92.75%) of them presenting with cough, followed by chest X-ray consolidation in 156 patients (80.83%) and history of previous TB treatment in 151 patients (78.24%). Cigarette smoking, HIV positivity, and low CD4 counts were significantly associated with MDRTB mortality, p values of 0.034, 0.044, and 0.048, respectively. Fever on the other hand was at the borderline with p value of 0.059. We conclude that cigarette smoking and HIV status are significant risk factors for mortality among MDRTB patients. HIV screening should continually be emphasized among patients and the general community for early ARTs initiation. Based on the results from our study, policy makers and public health personnel should consider addressing tobacco cessation as part of national TB control strategy	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.05.006	The spatial-temporal characteristics and health impacts of ambient fine particulate matter in China	Airborne particulate matter presents a serious health threat to human beings, but in China there have until now been few epidemiological studies, especially regarding the impact of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5). This study explored first the temporal and spatial characteristics of ambient airborne PM2.5 in China, 2013. Mortality, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic bronchitis were then evaluated as four health endpoints attributed to PM2.5. The results showed that the average annual PM2.5 concentration was 72.71 mu g/m(3); the PM2.5 concentration was below 35 mu g/m(3) for only 6% of the time, for the whole year. In terms of the PM2.5 concentration, January (133.10 mu g/m(3)) and December (120.19 mu g/m(3)) were the most polluted months, whereas July (38.76 mu g/m(3)) and August (41.31 mu g/m(3)) were the least polluted months. The most highly polluted areas were concentrated in North China. In terms of the health endpoints attributable to PM2.5, there were 763,595 mortality, 149,754 cardiovascular diseases, 446,035 respiratory diseases, and 2,389,035 chronic bronchitis cases. Results were very important to clarify the current PM2.5 pollution situation and the health impact of PM2.5 in China. And also provided a reference for the assessing damage caused by PM2.5 pollution.

10.1186/s13104-017-2748-9	Knowledge of standard precautions and barriers to compliance among healthcare workers in the Lower Manya Krobo District, Ghana	Abstract Background Implementing standard precautions (SP) has been a major challenge for health care workers (HCWs) especially those in developing countries thereby compromising their safety and increasing their exposure to blood-related pathogens. Compliance with safety precautions and occupational accidents among health workers are often unreported. The literature on knowledge and compliance to SP in Ghana is scanty. We report findings of a study that examined knowledge of SP, compliance and barriers to compliance with SP among HCWs in two health facilities in Ghana. Methods This is a facility-based cross-sectional study involving 100 HCWs from two health facilities in the Lower Manya Krobo District of the Eastern region. Statistical analysis summarised data on socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, knowledge of SP and compliance and barriers to SP in frequencies and percentages. Results Most respondents had been working as health staff for 0–5 years (65.0%). Generally, knowledge of the basic concepts of SP was low; only 37.0% of HCWs knew that SP includes hand washing before and after any direct contact with the patient, 39.0% knew about cough etiquettes and 40.0% knew about aseptic techniques which involve infection prevention strategies to minimise the risks of infection. Fifty percent of respondents always protect themselves against BBFs of patients. About a quarter of the respondents do not recap needles after use and 28.0% of respondents sometimes promptly wipe all blood spills. HCWs were of the opinion that wearing PPEs—such as gloves, aprons, gowns and goggles—might cause patients to panic sometimes (63.0%) and complying with SP sometimes interferes with the ability to provide care (38.0%). Sometimes, because of the demands of patient care, HCWs do not have enough time to comply with the rigours of SP (44.0%) and sometimes PPEs are not available. Conclusion Education programmes on the benefits of SP should be organised frequently. The OHS national policy together with the application of the IPC training manual in all health care facilities must be enforced. Communities of practice should be established and sanctions and rewards should be introduced to limit negative behavior and reinforce positive attitudes as regards SP	['SDG03']

10.1111/apa.13966	Swedish population-based study of pupils showed that foster children faced increased risks for ill health, negative lifestyles and school failure	AIM: This population-based study explored whether foster children faced a higher risk of health problems than children of the same age who were not in foster care.METHODS: Data for 13 739 pupils aged 10, 13 and 16 years were obtained from the Pupil Health Database in the county of Värmland, Sweden, for the school years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014. These included data on school performance, health, lifestyle and social relationships, based on children's interviews with school nurses.RESULTS: Of all the pupils, 171 (1.2%) were in foster care. Children in foster care were generally unhealthier than other children. Both girls and boys were at higher risk of chronic health problems, daily smoking, use of drugs and school failure. When the girls in foster care were compared to other girls, we found that they faced a higher risk of psychological and psychosomatic symptoms. This difference was not found for boys. Foster children were also more likely to express a more negative view on life.CONCLUSION: We confirmed earlier studies that children in foster care tended to have inferior health and well-being than other children. These findings emphasise that health, risky behaviour and school performance should be considered together when assessing foster children.</p	['SDG03']
10.1186/s12978-017-0374-6	Relationship between self-efficacy and patient knowledge on adherence to oral contraceptives using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8)	BackgroundPreconception care, including family planning, is a vital component of healthcare for women of reproductive age. An average female spends the majority of her reproductive life trying to prevent a pregnancy. In order to prevent unintended pregnancy, women often rely on the use of hormonal contraceptives. In the United States, the majority of hormonal contraceptive users are prescribed oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Reduced adherence to OCPs decreases their ability to prevent pregnancy. The study aimed to measure OCP adherence among female college students, and explore the relationship between OCP adherence, knowledge, and self-efficacy. MethodsThis cross-sectional study recruited a random sample of female college students to participate in an online survey. OCP adherence was based on the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Secondary reporting of medication adherence included participant reports of the number of missed OCP doses in the previous month and typical month of use. ResultsOf the 5000 invited, 1559 (31.3%) completed the survey. Of those responding, 670 (41.3%) reported use of OCPs. A total of 293 (44.3%) OCP users met criteria for low adherence, 241 (36.4%) met criteria for medium adherence, and 128 (19.3%) met criteria for high adherence. Those with high adherence had higher self-efficacy (P \u3c 0.001) and perceived knowledge (p \u3c 0.001). After controlling for other factors, self-efficacy (b = .37) and perceived knowledge (b = .09) remained associated with OCP adherence. ConclusionLess than 20% of respondents met the criteria for high adherence to OCPs. Self-efficacy and knowledge were associated with higher OCP adherence. Targeted interventions from healthcare providers, health educators, and other adherence related media to increase the knowledge and self-efficacy of patients using OCPs may improve adherence rates. Additional research is needed to evaluate the impact of innovative interventions focused on social and behavioral patient factors, like knowledge and self-efficacy, on adherence to OCPs	['SDG03']

10.1111/hsc.12500	The health and well-being of children and young people who are looked after: Findings from a face-to-face survey in Glasgow	Evidence suggests children and young people who are looked after (LACYP) may have poorer health outcomes than children and young people in the general population, particularly in relation to mental health. This paper discusses findings from a survey of the health and well-being of LACYP in Glasgow. A structured questionnaire used in the 2010 Glasgow Schools Survey (GSS) was adapted and administered in face-to-face interviews with 130 young people aged 11–18 in 2014–2015 to investigate various aspects of health and well-being including physical activity, diet and sleep, smoking, alcohol and drugs, health feelings and worries, behaviours, attitudes and expectations. LACYP were more likely to report that they had tried drugs, slightly more likely to have scores indicating a high level of difficulties on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and less likely to report that they ate fruit and vegetables, used active transport methods to get to school and expected to go on to further or higher education; however, reported rates of physical activity, smoking and drinking were similar. LACYP were less likely to report that they had engaged in antisocial behaviour, truancy or bullying or been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, less likely to worry or have low self-esteem, and more likely to rate their health positively. There were some variations according to placement type. The findings of this study present a more positive picture of the health and well-being of LACYP in Glasgow than might have been expected but should be treated with caution due to small sample size. Further research is needed to identify differences in relation to placement type and to determine whether being looked after might be associated with improved health and well-being outcomes for some children and young people	['SDG03']

10.1038/s41598-017-10286-1	The molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in the Comunidad Valenciana (Spain): Analysis of transmission clusters	AbstractHIV infections are still a very serious concern for public heath worldwide. We have applied molecular evolution methods to study the HIV-1 epidemics in the Comunidad Valenciana (CV, Spain) from a public health surveillance perspective. For this, we analysed 1804 HIV-1 sequences comprising protease and reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) coding regions, sampled between 2004 and 2014. These sequences were subtyped and subjected to phylogenetic analyses in order to detect transmission clusters. In addition, univariate and multinomial comparisons were performed to detect epidemiological differences between HIV-1 subtypes, and risk groups. The HIV epidemic in the CV is dominated by subtype B infections among local men who have sex with men (MSM). 270 transmission clusters were identified (&gt;57% of the dataset), 12 of which included ≥10 patients; 11 of subtype B (9 affecting MSMs) and one (n = 21) of CRF14, affecting predominately intravenous drug users (IDUs). Dated phylogenies revealed these large clusters to have originated from the mid-80s to the early 00 s. Subtype B is more likely to form transmission clusters than non-B variants and MSMs to cluster than other risk groups. Multinomial analyses revealed an association between non-B variants, which are not established in the local population yet, and different foreign groups.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1111/bcp.13396	In vivo and in vitro palatability testing of a new paediatric formulation of valaciclovir	Aims: The palatability of a new paediatric formulation of valaciclovir was assessed in children and their parents: non-inferiority of the new paediatric formulation (test formulation) compared to the reference formulation was investigated. Methods: In vivo palatability testing was performed in a randomized, two-period, multicentre, cross-over study. Children and their parents scored the liking of the new paediatric valaciclovir formulation and the reference formulation on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). To support formulation development and palatability testing, electronic tongue measurements were applied. Results: The electronic tongue measurement indicated taste-masking capabilities for three different formulations in the developmental phase. A glycerol-based formulation was further tested and compared to the reference formulation prepared out of crushed and suspended tablets. The mean difference (95% CI) in VAS scores between both formulations, as indicated by the children (n = 20), was 2.4 (−8.5, 13) mm, in favour of the new paediatric valaciclovir formulation. The mean (95% CI) difference in VAS scores indicated by the parents (n = 20) was −0.9 (−12, 9.8) mm. Conclusion: The palatability of the new paediatric valaciclovir formulation was considered non-inferior to the reference formulation prepared out of crushed tablets. We were able to optimize the study design and number of children to be included in the palatability testing by using electronic tongue measurements	['SDG03']

This study aims to evaluate the relationship between physical health, psychosocial risk factors and work engagement among Finnish women in municipal work units.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 among 726 female employees from 10 municipal work units of the city of Pori, Finland. Work engagement was assessed with the nine-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale. The American Heart Association’s concept of ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) was used to define physical health (non-smoking, body mass index Results: Of the study subjects, 25.2% had favourable 5–7 CVH metrics. The sum of CVH metrics, healthy diet and physical activity at goal were positively associated with work engagement. In subjects without psychosocial risk factors (36.7%), work engagement was high and stable. Presence of even one psychosocial risk factor was associated with a lower level of work engagement regardless of the sum of ideal CVH metrics.Conclusions: Both physical and mental health factors have a positive relationship with work engagement, whereas the presence of even one psychosocial risk factor has a negative association regardless of the level of classic cardiovascular risk factors.</p	['SDG03']

Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted that included all women who had reported as tubal ligation failure in the family planning unit of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in our institution during a 5-year span (2011 to 2016). Data were collected from case records maintained in the Family Planning Unit and Medical Record Department.   Results Sixty-eight cases of sterilization failure with longest interval of 19 years were documented, out of which 21 (30.9%) were interval laparoscopic ligation, 29 (42.6%) medical termination of pregnancy with lap ligation, 2 (0.9%) postpartum sterilization, and 10 (14.7%) concurrent with lower segment cesarean section. Only 37 (54.41%) patients reported failure in 1st trimester, 4 (5.8%) were beyond 20 weeks gestation, and 2 (2.9%) presented as ruptured ectopic pregnancy. There were six cases (14%) of spontaneous recanalization, three (6.9%) due to tuboperitoneal fistula, and 79% due to improper surgical technique.   Conclusion Female sterilization failure is a proven entity that can occur at any age, method, and interval. Failures due to improper technique can be prevented by following standard guidelines for tubal sterilization.   How to cite this article Sharma R, Gupta R, Guleria K, Suneja A.

10.1111/add.14057	Trends in age of smoking initiation in the Netherlands: a shift towards older ages?	Background and aim As smoking initiation generally occurs in adolescence, smoking prevention is targeted primarily at young adolescents (aged below 16 years). We hypothesize that, with the adoption of increasingly stronger youth access laws, a shift in the age of smoking initiation may have occurred. Design Repeated cross-sectional survey. Setting The Netherlands. Participants A total of 13 163 respondents born between 1980 and 1995. Measurements In the 2010-15 National Health Survey we measured retrospectively self-reported initiation rates per year of age by birth cohort (1980-83, 1984-87, 1988-91, 1992-95). Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess differences between cohorts, per sex and educational level. Findings Of those who started smoking, 67.2% initiated smoking between 12 and 16 years of age. Contrary to our hypothesis, no shift in initiation towards higher ages was observed. The peak age of initiation was 16 years for all cohorts. Initiation at ages 17-21 was lower in younger birth cohorts than in older birth cohorts [e.g. cohort 1993-95 versus 1980-83: odds ratio (OR) for initiating at 19-21 years = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.64]. Trends in age of initiation were similar for males and females. Initiation at ages 15-17 decreased across cohorts for respondents in higher education levels, but not for those in lower education levels. Conclusions In the Netherlands, the peak age of smoking initiation did not shift through our subsequent cohorts born between 1980 and 1995, suggesting that young adolescents remain the main target group for smoking initiation prevention policies	['SDG03']
10.2147/ijwh.s133760	Sexual autonomy and contraceptive use among women in Nigeria: Findings from the demographic and health survey data	Saritha P Viswan,1 T K Sundari Ravindran,1,2 Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala,1,3,4 Max G Petzold,1,5 Sharon Fonn1  1School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; 2Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum, Kerala, India; 3Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; 4Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; 5Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden  Context: The persistent low contraceptive use and high fertility in Nigeria despite improvements in educational achievements calls for an examination of the role of factors, which may moderate the use of modern contraception. This article explores the influence of sexual autonomy on the use of modern contraceptive methods among women and its relative importance compared with other, more traditional, indicators of women&rsquo;s autonomy such as education and occupation.Data and methods: Data from two Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), 2008 and 2013, were used in this study. An index of sexual autonomy was constructed by combining related DHS variables, and its association with current use of modern contraception was examined at each time point as well as over time using multivariate regression analysis.Results: The observed prevalence for use of modern contraception was 2.8 and 2.6 times higher among women who had high sexual autonomy in 2008 and 2013, respectively. The corresponding figures for women with secondary or higher education were 8.2 and 11.8 times higher, respectively, compared with women with no education. But after controlling for wealth index, religion, place of residence, autonomy and experience of intimate partner violence (IPV), the likelihood of use of modern contraception was lowered to about 2.5 (from 8.2) and 2.8 (from 11.8) times during 2008 and 2013, respectively, among women with secondary or higher education. The likelihood of use of modern contraception lowered only to 1.6 (from 2.8) and 1.8 (from 2.6) times among women with high sexual autonomy after controlling for other covariates, respectively, during the same period.Conclusion: Sexual autonomy seems to play an important role in women&rsquo;s use of modern contraceptive methods independent of education and a number of other factors related to women&rsquo;s status. Sexual autonomy needs to be simultaneously promoted alongside increasing educational opportunities to enhance women&rsquo;s ability to use modern contraception.

10.1002/jia2.25026	Factors associated with HIV testing among young men who have sex with men in Myanmar: A cross-sectional study	Introduction: In Myanmar, men who have sex with men (MSM) experience high risk of HIV infection. However, access to HIV testing and prevention services remains a challenge among this marginalized population. The objective of this study was to estimate population prevalence and correlates of prior HIV testing among young MSM (YMSM) and informs the development of HIV testing and intervention programmes that respond to the specific needs of this population. Methods: Five hundred and eighty-five YMSM aged 18 to 24 years were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in a cross-sectional survey conducted in six townships of Myanmar. RDS-adjusted population estimates were calculated to estimate prevalence of HIV testing; RDS-weighted logistic regression was used to examine correlates of HIV testing in the past 6 months and in a lifetime. Results: There were 12 participants who reported receiving a HIV-positive test; of those, five were tested in the past 6 months. The RDS-weighted prevalence estimates of lifetime (any prior) HIV testing was 60.6% (95% CI: 53.3% to 66.4%) and of recent ( ≤ 6 months) HIV testing was 50.1% (95% CI: 44.1% to 55.5%). In multivariable analysis, sexual identity was associated with lifetime but not recent HIV testing. Lifetime and recent HIV testing were associated with having three or more male sexual partners in the past 12 months (adjusted ORs (aORs) = 2.28, 95% CIs: 1.21 to 4.32 and 2.69, 95% CI: 1.59 to 4.56), having good HIV-related knowledge (aORs = 1.96, 95% CIs: 1.11 to 3.44 and 1.77, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.89), reporting high HIV testing self-efficacy (aORs = 13.5, 95% CIs: 6.0 to 30.1 and 9.81, 95% CI: 4.27 to 22.6) and having access to and use of non-HIV health-related services in the past 12 months (aORs = 13.2, 95% CIs: 6.85 to 25.6 and 7.15, 95% CI: 4.08 to 12.5) respectively. Conclusions: HIV testing coverage among YMSM aged 18 to 24 years old in Myanmar is still suboptimal. Integrated HIV testing and prevention services in existing health service provision systems with tailored HIV information and education programmes targeting YMSM to improve HIV-related knowledge and self-efficacy may help to promote regular HIV testing behaviour and contribute to sustainable control of the HIV epidemic among this marginalized population in Myanmar	['SDG03']

Tools that enable the rapid evaluation of protective immune responses are essential to vaccine development as they can provide selection criteria to rank order vaccine candidates. In this study we have revisited the Inhibition of Sporozoite Invasion (ISI) assay to assess the ability of antibodies to inhibit sporozoite infection of hepatocytes. By using GFP expressing sporozoites of the rodent parasite P. berghei we are able to robustly quantify parasite infection of hepatocyte cell lines by flow cytometry. In conjunction with recently produced transgenic P. berghei parasites that express P. falciparum sporozoite antigens, we have been able to use this assay to measure antibody mediated inhibition of sporozoite invasion against one of the lead malaria antigens P. falciparum CSP. By combining chimeric rodent parasites expressing P. falciparum antigens and a flow cytometric readout of infection, we are able to robustly assess vaccine-induced antibodies, from mice, rhesus macaques and human clinical trials, for their functional ability to block sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes	['SDG03']

10.1186/s12889-017-4950-z	Population cigarette consumption in Great Britain: Novel insights using retail sales data	Background: Accurate data to measure population cigarette consumption are vital for surveillance and for evaluating the impact of tobacco control policies. This study uses cigarette retail sales data to provide novel insights into trends and patterns in cigarette consumption in Great Britain.Methods: Cigarette sales estimates derived from electronic sales from most large grocery stores and a weighted representative sample of smaller convenience stores were obtained from Nielsen. Data on the number of cigarette sticks sold per calendar month and per week were obtained for Scotland and England/Wales (combined) for the period January 2008 to December 2015. Cigarette consumption per adult smoker per month was calculated using survey-based smoking prevalence estimates and mid-year population estimates.Results: Population cigarette consumption in Great Britain declined between 2008 and 2013. Cigarette sales have since stabilised at around 400 cigarettes per adult smoker per month. Cigarettes sold in 14- to 19-packs have substituted a sharp decline in 20-packs and now account for over half of all cigarettes sold in Great Britain. Cigarette consumption has been consistently higher in Scotland than England/Wales. This is due to higher sales of 20-packs in Scotland between 2008 and 2013, which has been substituted by higher sales of 14- to 19-packs in recent years.Conclusions: Cigarette retail sales data provide unique insights into levels and patterns of cigarette consumption and should be used for monitoring and evaluating tobacco control policy in Great Britain	['SDG03']

10.1007/s00268-017-4396-6	International Study of the Epidemiology of Paediatric Trauma: PAPSA Research Study	Objectives: Trauma is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The literature on paediatric trauma epidemiology in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. This study aims to gather epidemiological data on paediatric trauma. Methods: This is a multicentre prospective cohort study of paediatric trauma admissions, over 1&nbsp;month, from 15 paediatric surgery centres in 11 countries. Epidemiology, mechanism of injury, injuries sustained, management, morbidity and mortality data were recorded. Statistical analysis compared LMICs and high-income countries (HICs). Results: There were 1377 paediatric trauma admissions over 31&nbsp;days; 1295 admissions across ten LMIC centres and 84 admissions across five HIC centres. Median number of admissions per centre was 15 in HICs and 43 in LMICs. Mean age was 7&nbsp;years, and 62% were boys. Common mechanisms included road traffic accidents (41%), falls (41%) and interpersonal violence (11%). Frequent injuries were lacerations, fractures, head injuries and burns. Intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic injuries accounted for 3 and 2% of injuries. The mechanisms and injuries sustained differed significantly between HICs and LMICs. Median length of stay was 1&nbsp;day and 19% required an operative intervention; this did not differ significantly between HICs and LMICs. No mortality and morbidity was reported from HICs. In LMICs, in-hospital morbidity was 4.0% and mortality was 0.8%. Conclusion: The spectrum of paediatric trauma varies significantly, with different injury mechanisms and patterns in LMICs. Healthcare structure, access to paediatric surgery and trauma prevention strategies may account for these differences. Trauma registries are needed in LMICs for future research and to inform local policy	['SDG03']

Meeting such will require drastic improvements in the social conditions for women and girls. Understanding which social conditions have the greatest impact on health can help prioritise action, yet there is little comparative data. We use microdata from 338,580 women in 47 low- and middle-income countries to estimate the relative contributions of improved social determinants in bringing about maternal and child health gains over the past 20 years. Regression analyses examine determinants related to education, work, health services, family, and violence; the potential health benefit that could be derived from improving conditions is calculated. Secondary education and child marriage emerge as the strongest and most consistent predictors of health. The largest impact is seen on adolescent births: we estimate that achieving universal completion of secondary schooling for young women could lower adolescent births by 18 percentage points; eliminating child marriages could lower adolescent births by 11 points. Intervening in these two areas could also bring about substantial reductions in the unmet need for family planning, past-year intimate partner violence, and child mortality. Thus, we suggest prioritising policies targeting secondary education and child marriage in order to accelerate gender equity and health	['SDG03']

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.  METHODS: A descriptive method based on the database of road traffic accidents from the National Police of Kosovo.  RESULTS: In Kosovo for the period 2010-2015, on average, the yearly number of road traffic accidents is 18437 with mortality rate 7.4 per 100000 and lethality of 1.5%. The highest number of fatal cases are drivers and above 19 years old with more than 80%. Among injured significantly highest percentage is among passengers for all years and above 19 years old. Road traffic accident with a vehicle occurs most frequently, with approximately over 70%, mostly on dry road 72.9% and clear weather 71.1%. The driver is the contributing factors of road traffic accidents on average 99.3% whereas climatic conditions only 0.5%, with over 50% of crashes occurring in urban road 56.2%, mostly during Monday 16.0% and in the afternoon rush hours between 14.00-18.00 with 31.0%. CONCLUSIONS: There is a slight decrease in the mortality rate of 0.1‰ and lethality rate of 0.1% each year, whereas there is an increase of 21.5‰ for traumatism rate for each year	['SDG03']

10.3390/ijerph15020205	Impact of an outdoor smoking ban at secondary schools on cigarettes, e-cigarettes and water pipe use among adolescents: An 18-month follow-up	The effectiveness of outdoor smoking bans on smoking behavior among adolescents remains inconclusive. This study evaluates the long-term impact of outdoor school ground smoking bans among adolescents at secondary schools on the use of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes (with/without nicotine) and water pipes. Outdoor smoking bans at 19 Dutch secondary schools were evaluated using a quasi-experimental design. Data on 7733 adolescents were obtained at baseline, and at 6 and 18-month follow-up. The impact of outdoor smoking bans on 'ever use of conventional cigarettes', 'smoking onset', 'ever use of e-cigarette with nicotine', 'e-cigarette without nicotine', and 'water pipe' was measured. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used. At schools with a ban, implementation fidelity was checked. At schools where a ban was implemented, at 18-month follow-up more adolescents had started smoking compared to the control condition. No effect of implementation of the ban was found for smoking prevalence, e-cigarettes with/without nicotine, and water pipe use. Implementation fidelity was sufficient. No long-term effects were found of an outdoor smoking ban, except for smoking onset. The ban might cause a reversal effect when schools encounter difficulties with its enforcement or when adolescents still see others smoking. Additional research is required with a longer follow-up than 18 months	['SDG03']

Findings from Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal	The progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) is a contraceptive designed for use by breastfeeding women in the first year postpartum. This Report presents results of an acceptability study of the PVR in Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal. Women seeking postpartum family planning services were offered various contraceptive options including the PVR. Of the 174 participating women, 110 (63 percent) used one ring and 94 (54 percent) completed the study by using two rings over a six-month period. Women were interviewed up to three times: at the time they entered the study, at 3 months (the end of the first ring cycle), and at 6 months (the end of the second ring cycle or when they exited if they had discontinued earlier). Many participants found the ring to be acceptable, with over three-quarters reporting that it was easy to insert, remove, and reinsert. While a small proportion of women experienced ring expulsion, the majority did not. These findings suggest that even in countries with little or no use of vaginal health products, contraceptive vaginal rings offer women a new option that they are able and willing to use	['SDG03']

10.4269/ajtmh.17-0325	Mediating effect of repeated tuberculosis exposure on the risk of transmission to household contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	Primary Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission is an important driver of the global epidemic of resistance to tuberculosis drugs. A few studies have compared tuberculosis infection in contacts of index cases with different drug-resistant profiles, suggesting that contacts of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis cases are at higher risk. Repeated tuberculosis exposure in contacts of MDR tuberculosis patients through recurrent tuberculosis may modify this relationship. We compared tuberculosis infection in household contacts of MDR and drug-susceptible (DS) tuberculosis patients from six cities in southeastern China and investigated whether repeated tuberculosis exposure was a mediating factor. Tuberculosis infection was defined as a tuberculin skin test induration ≥ 10 mm. In all, 111 (28.0%) of 397 household contacts of MDR tuberculosis patients and 165 (24.7%) of 667 contacts of DS tuberculosis index cases were infected with tuberculosis. In a multivariate model not including the previous tuberculosis exposure, contacts of MDR tuberculosis patients had a higher likelihood of tuberculosis infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.84; P = 0.041). In a separate multivariate model adjusted for the previous tuberculosis exposure, the odds ratio of tuberculosis infection flipped and contacts of MDR cases were now at lower risk for tuberculosis infection (AOR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.38–0.81; P = 0.003). These findings suggest prior tuberculosis exposure in contacts strongly mediates the relationship between tuberculosis infection and the index drug resistance profile. Prior studies showing lower risk of developing tuberculosis among contacts of MDR tuberculosis patients may be partially explained by a lower rate of tuberculosis infection at baseline.</jats:p	['SDG03']

The US Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate the sale and promotion—and therefore the price—of tobacco products.ObjectiveTo examine the potential effect of federal minimum price regulation on the sales of cigarettes in the USA.MethodWe used yearly state-level data from the Tax Burden on Tobacco and other sources to model per capita cigarette sales as a function of price. We used the fitted model to compare the status quo sales with counterfactual scenarios in which a federal minimum price was set. The minimum price scenarios ranged from $0 to $12.ResultsThe estimated price effect in our model was comparable with that found in the literature. Our counterfactual analyses suggested that the impact of a minimum price requirement could range from a minimal effect at the $4 level to a reduction of 5.7 billion packs sold per year and 10 million smokers at the $10 level.ConclusionA federal minimum price policy has the potential to greatly benefit tobacco control and public health by uniformly increasing the price of cigarettes and by eliminating many price-reducing strategies currently available to both sellers and consumers.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

10.1093/infdis/jix678	Innovative and New Approaches to Laboratory Diagnosis of Zika and Dengue: A Meeting Report	Epidemics of dengue, Zika, and other arboviral diseases are increasing in frequency and severity. Current efforts to rapidly identify and manage these epidemics are limited by the short diagnostic window in acute infection, the extensive serologic cross-reactivity among flaviviruses, and the lack of point-of-care diagnostics to detect these viral species in primary care settings. The Partnership for Dengue Control organized a workshop to review the current landscape of Flavivirus diagnostics, identified current gaps, and developed strategies to accelerate the adoption of promising novel technologies into national programmes. The rate-limiting step to bringing new diagnostics tools to the market is access to reference materials and well-characterized clinical samples to facilitate performance evaluation. We suggest the creation of an international laboratory response consortium for flaviviruses with a de-centralized biobank of well-charachterized samples to facilitate assay validation. Access to proficiency panels are needed to ensure quality control, in additional to in-country capacity building.Accepted versio	['SDG03']

10.1186/s12889-018-5362-4	TB epidemiology: Where are the young women? Know your tuberculosis epidemic, know your response	Abstract Background The global predominance of tuberculosis in men has received significant attention. However, epidemiological studies now demonstrate that there is an increased representation of young women with tuberculosis, especially in high HIV burden settings where young women bear a disproportionate burden of HIV. The role of the HIV epidemic, as well as changes in behavioural, biological, and structural risk factors are explored as potential explanations for the increasing burden of tuberculosis in young women. Discussion As young women are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, it is unsurprising that the TB epidemic in this setting has become increasingly feminised. This age-sex trend of TB in South Africa is similar to WHO estimates for other countries with a high HIV prevalence where there are more female than male cases notified up to the age of 25 years. The high prevalence of anaemia of chronic disease in young women with HIV is an additional potential reason for their increased TB risk. The widespread use of injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate contraception, which has been shown to possess selective glucocorticoid effect and oestrogen suppression, in young women may be an important emerging biological risk factor for tuberculosis in young women. Behavioural factors such as alcohol use and tobacco smoking patterns are further factors which may be responsible for the narrowing of the sex gap in TB epidemiology. In comparison to the significantly higher alcohol consumption rates in men globally, there is a narrowing gap in alcohol consumption between the sexes in South Africa with alarming rates of alcohol abuse in young women. There is a similar narrowing of the tobacco smoking gap between the sexes in South Africa, with increasing smoking prevalence in young women. Conclusion With nearly 70% of all TB patients being co-infected with HIV in our setting, it is not surprising that the age and sex distribution of TB is increasingly resembling the distribution of HIV in this region of dual hyperendemicity. New TB service design must begin to reflect the presence of young women as a significant group burdened by the disease	['SDG03']

10.3390/ijerph15040626	Health impacts and economic costs of air pollution in the metropolitan area of Skopje	Background: Urban outdoor air pollution, especially particulate matter, remains a major environmental health problem in Skopje, the capital of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Despite the documented high levels of pollution in the city, the published evidence on its health impacts is as yet scarce. Methods: we obtained, cleaned, and validated Particulate Matter (PM) concentration data from five air quality monitoring stations in the Skopje metropolitan area, applied relevant concentration-response functions, and evaluated health impacts against two theoretical policy scenarios. We then calculated the burden of disease attributable to PM and calculated the societal cost due to attributable mortality. Results: In 2012, long-term exposure to PM2.5 (49.2 μg/m3) caused an estimated 1199 premature deaths (CI95% 821–1519). The social cost of the predicted premature mortality in 2012 due to air pollution was estimated at between 570 and 1470 million euros. Moreover, PM2.5 was also estimated to be responsible for 547 hospital admissions (CI95% 104–977) from cardiovascular diseases, and 937 admissions (CI95% 937–1869) for respiratory disease that year. Reducing PM2.5 levels to the EU limit (25 μg/m3) could have averted an estimated 45% of PM-attributable mortality, while achieving the WHO Air Quality Guidelines (10 μg/m3) could have averted an estimated 77% of PM-attributable mortality. Both scenarios would also attain significant reductions in attributable respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions. Conclusions: Besides its health impacts in terms of increased premature mortality and hospitalizations, air pollution entails significant economic costs to the population of Skopje. Reductions in PM2.5 concentrations could provide substantial health and economic gains to the city	['SDG03']

Severe withdrawal symptoms are the reason most people have a hard time quitting smoking. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of energy homeostasis and is activated in response to cellular stressors. We discovered that the AMPK pathway is activated following chronic nicotine use but is repressed following nicotine withdrawal. We reasoned that increasing pAMPK levels pharmacologically might reduce symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. After giving mice metformin, an AMPK activator, we were able to reduce nicotine withdrawal, and found that this was dependent on the presence of the AMPK protein in the hippocampus. This study suggests that AMPK activation could be a target for smoking cessation.</jats:p	['SDG03']

The objective of this study is to measure the risk factors for being infected with hepatitis C (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis among SD-only users, heroin-only users and poly-drug users. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 from a national HIV surveillance site in Southwest China, 447 poly-drug, 526 SD-only and 318 heroin-only users were recruited. Poly-drug users have higher drug-use frequency, higher rates of drug-sharing and unsafe sexual acts than other users (p < 0.05). About a third (36.7%) of poly-drug users experienced sexual arousal due to drug effects, which is higher than the rate among other drug users. Poly-drug users had the highest prevalence of HIV (10.5%) and syphilis (3.6%), but heroin-only users had the highest prevalence of HCV (66.0%) (all p < 0.05) among three groups. Logistic regression shows among poly-drug users, having sex following drug consumption and using drugs ≥1/day were the major risk factors for both HIV (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.4, 95% CI [1.8-3.4]; 2.3, [1.6-3.1]) and syphilis infection (AOR = 4.1, [2.1-6.9]; 3.9, [1.8-5.4]).

Common clinical signs associated with the disease include a sudden fever, severe headaches, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained hemorrhages. In Africa, with strained medical facilities and remote localities, prompt identification and diagnosis of the symptoms of Ebola in a suspected patient are important to the control of the epidemic and in curtailing further spread. This chapter presents the development of an Android mobile application called EbolaDiag (Ebola Diagnosis), which is capable of supporting the diagnosis, screening, and healthcare experts working on the frontline in contact tracing and monitoring of the spread of Ebola. Furthermore, EbolaDiag is suitable for aiding the strained medical facilities in endemic areas. In addressing this gap, the application provided a model for implementing such solutions in pandemic environments. Such a solution becomes more relevant and useful to combat Ebola and several other diseases in similar environments.</p	['SDG03']

Antibiotics have been known for decades for treatment of bacterial strains and their overuse and irrational applications are causing increasing bacteria resistance. Therefore, there is a strong need to find alternative ways for efficient water disinfection and microbial control. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have demonstrated strong antimicrobial properties due to their remarkable structure. This paper reviews the antimicrobial properties of CNTs, discusses diverse mechanisms of action against microorganisms as well as their applicability for water disinfection and microbial control. Safety concerns, challenges of CNTs as antimicrobial agents and future opportunities for their application in the water remediation process are also highlighted.</jats:p	['SDG03']

To reduce the mortality rate from these conditions,  Ethiopia launched an ambitious Health Extension Programme (HEP) in 2003. Trained Community Health Workers (CHWs),  named Health Extension Workers (HEWs) were deployed to deliver a package of care which includes integrated Community  Case-Management (iCCM) of common childhood diseases.  OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study aimed to explore approaches and strategies used in the HEW training and supervision as part  of an evaluation of the Catalytic Initiative to Save a Million Lives.  METHODS: A qualitative rapid appraisal study using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews was conducted.  RESULTS: Training of HEWs followed a cascaded training of trainer approach supported by implementing partners under guidance  of the Ministry of Health. A comprehensive planning phase enabled good coverage of districts and consistency in training  approaches. Training was complemented by on-going supportive supervision. HEW motivation was enhanced through regular  review meetings and opportunities for career progression.  CONCLUSION: These findings describe a thorough approach to training and supervision of HEWs delivering iCCM in rural Ethiopia.  Ongoing investments by partners will be critical for long-term sustainability.DHE	['SDG03']

10.1017/s0021932017000657	HIV epidemic heterogeneity in Zimbabwe: Evidence from successive demographic and health surveys	SummaryZimbabwe has one of the worst HIV epidemics in the world. This study investigated data from two successive Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Surveys (ZDHS) conducted in 2005–06 and 2010–11. A random representative sample of 30,000 men aged 15–59 and women aged 15–49 was selected from the two surveys. The HIV prevalence was mapped with a flexible, coherent regression framework using a geo-additive semi-parametric mixed model. HIV indicator prevalence maps were constructed at the regional level, and at the administrative level relevant for policy design, planning and decision-making. Substantial regional variation was found, not only in the burden of HIV, but also in its risk factors. The results suggest that responses/policies should vary at the regional level to ensure that the often diverse needs of populations across a country are met and incorporated into planning the HIV response. The use of geographically referenced data in two successive ZDHS provides crucial new insights into the spatial characteristics of the HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe. In particular, it highlights the HIV heterogeneity across Zimbabwe, with substantial regional variation, not only in the burden of HIV, but also in its risk factors.</jats:p	['SDG03']
10.1108/ijph-02-2017-0007	Outcomes of the “STEPS” HIV prevention training program for young males in the penitentiary institution, Ukraine	Purpose Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics globally. Due to their engagement in high-risk behaviors, adolescents and emerging adults involved with the penitentiary system are at a particularly high risk of HIV-acquisition. To address the epidemic, young males (aged 14 to 20 years) in penitentiary institutions across Ukraine participated in a ten-week, group-based HIV-prevention intervention (STEPS). The paper aims to discuss these issues.   Design/methodology/approach The authors analyzed clinical and programmatic services data collected as part of an evaluation of the STEPS intervention. Paired t-tests and χ2 were used to examine pre- and post-intervention differences in HV knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors and alcohol and other drug use knowledge.   Findings In total, 105 male youths participated in the ten-session STEPS intervention. At baseline, males reported high frequencies of risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sexual activity, injection drug use), moderate levels of HIV-related knowledge, and negative attitudes toward HIV and people living with HIV. At follow-up (immediately following the last STEPS session), participants’ HIV-related knowledge substantially improved and participants tended to have more favorable attitudes toward HIV.   Research limitations/implications Outcomes suggest that knowledge and attitudes about HIV among Ukrainian incarcerated youth can improve as a result of group-based HIV-prevention intervention.   Originality/value In Ukraine, individuals involved with the criminal justice system are one of the populations most-at-risk for HIV; criminal justice-involved adolescents and young adults are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. Research among this sub-population is limited. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating an on-going group-based HIV-prevention program designed to reduce adolescent risk of HIV. </jats:sec	['SDG03']

Despite an extensive preventive campaign, the incidence of HIV remains high.Condoms are an important contributor to prevention of new HIV infections, although they are not consistently used by young adults.Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the reasons why condoms are not consistently usedby young adults.Setting: Mahalapye District Hospital and Airstrip Clinic, Botswana.Method: This was a phenomenological qualitative study using individual in-depth interviews.Eleven participants were purposively selected, including six males and five females. Data were transcribed and analysed using the framework method.Results: All participants acknowledged the importance of utilising condoms to prevent unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. Reasons not to use condoms were a need to have a child,implied lack of trust or faithfulness, long-term relationships need toplease the partner and decreased pleasure. Other contributing factors were lack of knowledge of benefits, less fear of contracting HIV and AIDS as it can now be controlled with medication,influence of tradition, alcohol and drug abuse, peer pressure, power and gender issues and the refusal of the partner. The female condom was largely rejected by young adults in general and by women in particular because of its size and the perception that it is complicated to insert.Conclusion: The current preventive campaign against HIV and AIDS needs to take cognisance of the factors affecting decisions on the use of condoms by young adults and the obstacles to their use, particularly the new belief that HIV and AIDS is no longer a significant concern.</jats:p	['SDG03']

Foetal growth patterns were reconstructed by the results of three ultrasound examinations carried out at the 11th/12th, 20th/21th and 32th/33thweek of gestation. In detail, crown-rump length, biparietal diameter, fronto-occipital diameter, head circumference, abdominal transverse diameter, abdominal anterior-posterior diameter, abdominal circumference, and femur length were determined. Birth weight, birth length and head circumference were measured immediately after birth. Young teenage mothers (≤15 years), older adolescent mothers (16-19 years), mothers of optimal age range (20-35 years) and mothers of advanced age (>35 years) differed significantly in body height, pre-pregnancy weight status and gestational weight gain. Surprisingly, the foetuses of young adolescent mothers were the largest ones during first trimester. During the second and third trimester however, the foetuses of mothers of optimal age range (20-35 years) and mothers older than 35 years showed larger biometric dimensions than adolescent mothers. According to multiple regression analyses, maternal age was significantly related to Foetal head size (ß =-0.04; 95% CI = -0,08 - 0.01; p=0.034) and abdominal dimensions (ß= 0.03; 95% CI = 0.01-0.05; p=0,011) during the second trimester and to birthweight (ß= -0.03; 95% CI= -4.40 - 0.04; p=0.050). The associations however, are quite weak and the statistical significance is maybe due to the large sample size. At the time of birth, offspring of mothers of optimal age range (20 to 35 years) is significantly larger than that of adolescent mothers and mothers of advanced age. Mothers of advanced age showed the significantly highest (p=<0.0001) prevalence (5.6%) of SGA newborns (<2500g). The small size of newborn among young adolescent mothers may be due to a competition over nutrients between the still growing mothers and the foetuses during the third trimester, while placental ageing may be responsible for smaller size of offspring among mothers of advanced age	['SDG03']

Esto debido entre otros factores a barreras y restricciones de acceso a los servicios de salud, falta de autonomía, falta de habilidades para la toma de decisiones asertivas y baja oferta de servicios de salud específicos,  como los servicios de salud amigables para adolescentes y jóvenes (SSAAJ). Estos últimos son muy importantes ya que tienen como objetivo facilitar el acceso y la atención integral de la población adolescente y joven, en el marco de los derechos sexuales y reproductivos. En el municipio de Labateca se identificó, que la estrategia de servicios amigables, no   se da con un marco organizacional articulado y programático; como principal causa asociada a esto, es que a la fecha no se han realizado procesos estructurados de evaluación de la implementación del modelo. Es por esto que el objetivo de este proyecto, fue diseñar un sistema de evaluación de desempeño de la Unidad de salud amigable para adolescentes y   jóvenes del Municipio de Labateca Norte de Santander en base al Modelo SSAAJ. Para la metodología se tuvo en cuenta la guía colombiana de servicios amigables para adolescentes y jóvenes 2008 y las guías de evaluación de desempeño de programas en salud pública de la CEPAL, donde se involucró aspectos como la caracterización, dimensiones a evaluar, matriz de marco lógico e instrumentos para la recolección de la información. El resultado principal obtenido, corresponde al diseño del sistema de evaluación con cinco subproductos correspondientes a: la caracterización de la población objeto y de los actores internos y externos, caracterización de los componentes del modelo implementados en la unidad amigable, dimensiones de desempeño a evaluar y metodología de evaluación, matriz de marco lógico como ruta de acción específica de evaluación y la creación de instrumentos para la recolección de la información.

AnexosMaestría en Salud PúblicaAdolescents and young people still face numerous challenges and risks regarding their health and their sexual and reproductive rights. This is due, among other factors, to barriers and restrictions on access to health services, lack of autonomy, lack of skills for assertive decision-making and low supply of specific health services, such as the friendly health services for adolescents and young people (SSAAJ). The latter are very important since their objective is to facilitate access and comprehensive care for the adolescent and young population, within the framework of sexual and reproductive rights. In the municipality of Labateca it was identified that the friendly services strategy does not it occurs with an articulated and programmatic organizational framework; The main cause associated with this is that to date no structured evaluation processes have been carried out for the implementation of the model. That is why the objective of this project was to design a performance evaluation system for the adolescent-friendly health unit and youth from the Municipality of Labateca Norte de Santander based on the SSAAJ Model. For the methodology, the Colombian guide on friendly services for adolescents and young people 2008 and the performance evaluation guides of ECLAC public health programs were taken into account, where aspects such as characterization, dimensions to be evaluated, logical framework matrix were involved. and instruments for the collection of information. The main result obtained corresponds to the design of the evaluation system with five by-products corresponding to: the characterization of the target population and the internal and external actors, characterization of the model components implemented in the friendly unit, performance dimensions to be evaluated and evaluation methodology, logical framework matrix as a specific evaluation action route and the creation of instruments for the collection of information. The application of this evaluation system in the future may contribute to the improvement in the implementation of the model of friendly services	['SDG03']

However, currently, evidence about Vietnamese customers&rsquo; and restaurants&rsquo; compliance with the Law is constrained. This study aimed to explore customers&rsquo; perceptions; attitudes and practices towards the compliance with tobacco control regulations in the restaurants in Hanoi, Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was performed in October 2015 with 1746 customers in 176 communes in Hanoi, Vietnam. Data about customers&rsquo; perceptions on how restaurants comply with the smoking control law and whether customers smoking actively or experienced SHS in restaurants in the last 30 days were collected. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model was used to determine the factors related to smoking in the restaurant. Most customers were aware of the law on Tobacco Harm Prevention (79%; n = 1320) and regulations that prohibited smoking in restaurants (78.4%; n = 1137). While 75.8% (n = 1285) of customers perceived that they did not see or rarely saw no-smoking signs, 17.7% (n = 481) of customers reported that they frequently saw direct marketing of tobacco in visited restaurants. About one-fourth of customers witnessed that the staff reminded customers not to smoke inside restaurants (28.8%; n = 313), and 65% (n = 1135) sometimes or always were exposed to secondhand smoke in their visited restaurants. People who were female (OR = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.01&ndash;0.05) were less likely to report their smoking in the restaurant than their counterparts. Those having higher age (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01&ndash;1.06), high school education (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.07&ndash;4.26), being office workers (OR = 3.24, 95% CI = 1.33&ndash;7.92) or unemployed (OR = 4.45; 95% CI = 1.09&ndash;18.15) had a higher likelihood of reporting to be restaurant smokers than those having lower high education or students, respectively. This study highlighted a low level of perceived compliance with the smoke-free law in Vietnamese restaurants. Improving the monitoring systems for the enforcement of the smoking law in restaurants should be prioritized; restaurant owners should implement 100% smoke-free environments as following the best practice towards the tobacco control law along with educational campaigns to promote the awareness of restaurant owners and customers about the tobacco control law	['SDG03']
10.1521/aeap.2018.30.3.267	Global citizen, immigrant, survivor, activist, gayby boomer, academic, and editor: Dr. sy and the history of aids education and prevention	In this 30th anniversary of AIDS Education and Prevention, we turn our attention to its founder and editor, Dr. Francisco Sy. I trace Dr. Sy's trajectory, from growing up in a Filipino-Chinese family in Manila to Harvard, Johns Hopkins, South Carolina, and then to the journal. The loss of friends and colleagues to the AIDS epidemic stands out as Sy's driving force behind the journal. AIDS Education and Prevention was also created to fill a tremendous gap in the field: a scientific platform to circulate and discuss research on HIV and AIDS prevention. Over its life course, the content of the journal has mirrored the life of epidemic. Initially, the articles focused on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, mostly in the United States. Now, the articles deal with health interventions and pre-exposure prophylaxis, with authors coming from all over the globe. In Sy's opinion, HIV will become endemic, as other infectious diseases have over our history of epidemics, so the role of journals such as AIDS Education and Prevention will remain vital. </jats:p	['SDG03']

In addition, ocean acidification (OA) as a major environmental stress is affecting marine organisms. In this study, we investigated the hemocyte responses of the estuarine oyster Crassostrea rivularis exposed to six combinations of two pH levels (8.1 and 7.7) and three Cu concentrations (0, 10 and 50 mu g/l) using flow cytometry in vitro and in vivo. In both experiments, Cu and low pH jointly affected the hemocyte parameters of oyster. High Cu exposure resulted in decreased total hemocyte count (THC), esterase activity (EA) and lysosomal content (LC) and increased hemocyte mortality (HM), phagocytosis activity (PA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, especially under low pH conditions. The immune suppression of metal-exposure was more significant than low pH exposure with a 28-d experimental period in oysters. A slight recovery of the immune parameters was observed in THC, HM, PA, ROS and LC. During the depuration period, the modulatory effects of pH were still obvious. In addition, carry-over effects of high Cu and low pH were still observed. Overall, our results showed that copper and low pH weaken immune functions of hemocyte in oysters, with synergistic effects. This work provides new evidence of sublethal negative effects of metals on marine animals under global change scenarios, and copper likely leads to reduced fitness of oysters under low pH conditions	['SDG03']

10.1183/13993003.02352-2017	The incidence of tuberculosis among adolescents and young adults: A global estimate	Historical data show that the risk of tuberculosis increases dramatically during adolescence, and young people face unique challenges in terms of case detection and effective treatment. However, little is known about the burden of tuberculosis among young people in the modern era. This study aimed to provide the first estimates of the global and regional incidence of tuberculosis among young people aged 10–24 years.Using the World Health Organization (WHO) database of tuberculosis notifications for 2012, we estimated the burden of tuberculosis among young people by WHO region. Adjustments were made for incomplete age disaggregation and underreporting, using supplementary data from several countries representing diverse tuberculosis epidemics.We estimate that 1.78 million (uncertainty interval (UI) 1.23–3.00 million) young people developed tuberculosis in 2012, accounting for 17% of all new tuberculosis cases globally. Young people in the WHO South East Asian Region (721 000, UI 473 000–1.35 million) and the WHO African Region (534 000, UI 359 000–912 000) experienced the greatest number of tuberculosis episodes.Young people suffer a considerable burden of tuberculosis. Age-specific burden of disease estimation for this age group is complicated by incomplete age disaggregation of tuberculosis data, highlighting the importance of continued surveillance system strengthening.</jats:p	['SDG03']

This study seeks to examine the underlying factors that may be associated with these four adverse reproductive health outcomes.                                               Methods                 In a cross-sectional study of 1413 sexually active of young women, we explored these four adverse reproductive health outcomes by considering socio-demographic factors, socio-economic factors, sexual risk behaviour, substance abuse and knowledge about reproductive health by using a questionnaire. Consenting participants were asked about previous pregnancies and were tested for HIV, STIs and FGS. Multivariable regression analyses were used to explore the factors associated with these four reproductive health outcomes.                                               Results                                                                                1.                                                Early pregnancy: Among the young women, 44.4% had already been pregnant at least once. Associated factors were hormonal contraceptives, (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 17.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.73–25.29), and sexual debut < 16 years (AOR: 3.83, 95% CI: 2.68–5.47). Living with both parents (AOR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25–0.57) and having a steady partner (AOR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.24–0.76) were identified as protective factors against pregnancy.                                                                                        2.                                                HIV: HIV prevalence was 17.1%. The odds of having HIV were higher in intergenerational (AOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.05–4.06) and intragenerational relationships (AOR: 1.51 95% CI: 1.06–2.15), compared to age-homogenous relationships. Other associated factors were: condom use (AOR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.16–2.20), number of times treated for an STI (AOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.02–1.71), and total number of partners (AOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03–1.28).                                                                                        3.                                                STIs: Participants who had at least one STI (40.5%) were associated with total partner number (AOR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06–1.30), and testing HIV positive (AOR: 1.88, 95% CI 1.41–2.50).                                                                                        4.                                                FGS: FGS prevalence (19.7%) was associated with previous anti-schistosomal treatment (AOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.57–3.05).                                                                                                                               Conclusion                 There is a high prevalence of pregnancy, HIV, STIs and FGS among sexually active young women in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Multidisciplinary approaches are urgently needed for educational and health literacy programs prior to sexual debut, and health care facilities, which should be made accessible for young women	['SDG03']
10.1161/strokeaha.117.019580	Residential proximity to major roadways and risk of incident ischemic stroke in NOMAS (The Northern Manhattan Study)	Background and Purpose—             The evidence supporting the deleterious cardiovascular health effects of living near a major roadway is growing, although this association is not universal. In primary analyses, we hypothesized that residential proximity to a major roadway would be associated with incident ischemic stroke and that cardiovascular risk factors would modify that association.                                   Methods—             NOMAS (The Northern Manhattan Study) is an ongoing, population-based cohort study designed to measure cardiovascular risk factors, stroke incidence, and other outcomes in a multiethnic urban population. Recruitment occurred from 1993 to 2001 and participants are followed-up annually by telephone. Residential addresses at baseline were geocoded and Euclidean distance to nearest major roadway was estimated and categorized as in prior studies. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of this distance to incidence of stroke and other outcomes, adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, year at baseline, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. We assessed whether these associations varied by age, sex, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.                                   Results—             During a median follow-up period of 15 years (n=3287), 11% of participants were diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Participants living &lt;100 m from a roadway had a 42% (95% confidence interval, 1.01–2.02) higher rate of ischemic stroke versus those living &gt;400 m away. This association was more pronounced among noncurrent smokers (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–2.26) and not evident among smokers (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.23–2.06). There was no clear pattern of association between proximity to major roadways and other cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, all-cause death, or vascular death.                                   Conclusions—             In this urban multiethnic cohort, we found evidence supporting that within-city variation in residential proximity to major roadway is associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke. An individual’s smoking history modified this association, with the association remaining only among participants not currently smokers.           </jats:sec	['SDG03']

It starts by recalling the rationale for creating UNAIDS and explains how its mandate and structure has enabled communities affected by HIV to remain engaged. This engagement has been critical in ensuring that human rights considerations remain at the forefront of the global AIDS response. The chapter also looks at the journey ahead, taking AIDS “out of isolation.” It argues that this process can benefit not only the AIDS response but also other health-related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets, in particular universal health coverage (UHC). It concludes by recognizing the SDGs as a springboard for UNAIDS to scale up efforts to support the realization of human rights, which will ultimately determine whether we will be able to reach the end of the AIDS epidemic.</p	['SDG03']

Quality of services is explored through physicians’ accounts of the knock-on effect of shortages of equipment, supplies and personnel on the right to health and its ethical implications. Health workers themselves were found to be operating under extreme conditions, in particular responding to the most recent chemical attacks that occurred in 2017, with implications for their own health and mental well-being.ConclusionsThe study provides unique insight into the impact war has had on Syrian’s right to health through the accounts of a sample of Syrian health professionals, with continuing relevance to the current conflict and professional issues facing health workers in conflict settings.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

10.1071/py18040	Australians' understanding of the decline in fertility with increasing age and attitudes towards ovarian reserve screening	The aim of this study is to determine Australians’ understanding of the decline in fertility with age, social determinants that influence their decision to start a family and attitudes towards ovarian reserve screening as a tool allowing personalised reproductive life planning. An online survey of 383 childless Australian men and women, aged 18–45 years, was conducted. Both sexes overestimated natural and in vitro fertilization (IVF)-assisted fertility potential with increasing age, with the magnitude of overestimation being more pronounced for men and IVF treatment compared with natural conception. The primary determinants for starting a family were a stable relationship, followed by establishment of career; availability of accessible child care and paid parental leave were considered less important. Finally, the majority of women (74%) would alter their reproductive life planning if they were identified as having low ovarian reserve on screening. Despite increased education, Australians continue to have a poor understanding of age-related decline in natural and IVF-assisted conception, potentially explaining why many delay starting a family. Ovarian reserve screening may help identify individuals at increased risk of premature diminished fertility, giving these women the ability to bring forward their plans for natural conception or undertake fertility preservation (oocyte freezing). </jats:p	['SDG03']

In the USA, Philip Morris International (PMI) has submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 seeking authorisation to market its HTPs, IQOS, with reduced risk and reduced exposure claims.MethodsWe examined the PMI’s Perception and Behavior Assessment Studies evaluating perceptions of reduced risk claims that were submitted to the FDA and made publicly available.ResultsQualitative and quantitative studies conducted by PMI demonstrate that adult consumers in the USA perceive reduced exposure claims as reduced risk claims.ConclusionThe data in the PMI modified risk tobacco product IQOS application do not support reduced risk claims and the reduced exposure claims are perceived as reduced risk claims, which is explicitly prohibited by the FDA. Allowing PMI to promote IQOS as reduced exposure would amount to a legally sanctioned repeat of the ‘light’ and ‘mild’ fraud which, for conventional cigarettes, is prohibited by the US law and the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

This scenario has changed in recent years as there has been a steady increase in COPD prevalence and mortality rates in women. The increased prevalence of COPD among women is likely attributable to several factors including the increased rates of cigarette smoking observed in women during recent years, exposure to indoor air pollution as well as increased occupational exposures since women take on previously male-dominated occupational roles related to risk exposure.

Use of antenatal steroid can reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality in preterm births, but its effect on ROP remained controversial. We aim to determine the association between antenatal steroid and risk of ROP by a systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsReported studies on the association between antenatal steroid and risk of ROP or severe ROP were identified from MEDLINE and Embase databases from their inception to November 2016. Outcome measures were ORs with 95% CIs. Extracted data were pooled using a random-effect model or fixed-effect model where appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed, and sensitivity analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 434 relevant studies were identified, and 28 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis, involving 20 731 neonates with 4202 cases of ROP. Among the 28 studies included, 13 studies provided data evaluating the association between antenatal steroid use and severe ROP, involving 4999 neonates with 792 cases of severe ROP. Antenatal steroid administration was associated with a reduced risk of ROP development (ORunadjusted=0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98; ORadjusted=0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94) and progression to severe ROP (ORunadjusted=0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86).ConclusionAntenatal steroid administration is associated with a reduced risk of ROP development and progression to severe ROP. Our results strengthened the indications of antenatal steroid therapy to high-risk mothers giving preterm births, especially in low-income and middle-income countries where antenatal steroid are not yet widely used.</jats:sec	['SDG03']

10.3390/s18113619	An ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the geospatial sensor web	Due to the rapid installation of a massive number of fixed and mobile sensors, monitoring machines are intentionally or unintentionally involved in the production of a large amount of geospatial data. Environmental sensors and related software applications are rapidly altering human lifestyles and even impacting ecological and human health. However, there are rarely specific geospatial sensor web (GSW) applications for certain ecological public health questions. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the GSW. We design a Human and Ecological health Risks Ontology (HERO) based on a semantic sensor network ontology template. We also illustrate a web-based prototype, the Human and Ecological Health Risk Management System (HaEHMS), which helps health experts and decision makers to estimate human and ecological health risks. We demonstrate this intelligent system through a case study of automatic prediction of air quality and related health risk.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1186/s12889-018-6151-9	Trends in the ease of cigarette purchase among Korean adolescents: Evidence from the Korea youth risk behavior web-based survey 2005-2016	Abstract Background According to the Juvenile Protection Act in Korea, no one is allowed to sell, rent, or distribute tobacco products to adolescents. Furthermore, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 16 prohibits the sale of tobacco products to minors. In this study, we investigated the trends in and associated factors of the ease of cigarette purchase among Korean adolescents from 2005 to 2016. Methods The analyses were based on the data of the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. We estimated the trends in the ease of cigarette purchase from 2005 to 2016 and evaluated associated factors. Ease of cigarette purchase was defined as the proportion of adolescents who were able to purchase cigarettes from among those who had tried to purchase cigarettes in the past 30 days. Results The ease of cigarette purchase began decreasing since 2008 (81.3%) compared to 2005 (83.9%). It decreased to 76.5% in 2013 and further decreased to 71.4% in 2016. The ease of cigarette purchase increased for adolescents who were in higher grades, smoked larger amounts of cigarettes per day, lived in metropolitan cities, had problematic drinking in the past year, and had close friends who smoked. It decreased in adolescents who had current smokers among their family members. Conclusions Although the proportion of adolescents who were able to purchase cigarettes significantly decreased starting in 2008, more than 70% of Korean adolescents can still purchase cigarettes. Enforcement of the Juvenile Protection Act must be strengthened in order to prevent cigarette use among adolescents	['SDG03']

10.1016/j.ijmyco.2016.10.001	What can we learn from the past?—A pediatrician's view	AbstractWhen the tuberculosis epidemic reached its peak in central Europe in the 1900s (not until the 2000s in sub-Saharan Africa), both contained and disseminated tuberculosis was mainly regarded as a childhood disease. From 1920, before the use of the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine and the possibility of drug treatment, there was a drastic decline in the rate of tuberculosis incidence in the Western world. In 1970, the case rate had declined in Sweden from 500/100,000 individuals to 1/100,000 individuals. We recently studied childhood tuberculosis in the Stockholm area from 1971 to 2015. During this period the case rate had increased from 1/100,000 individuals to 8/100,000 individuals. A major contributing factor has been increased immigration and, more recently, from high incidence countries. While there are very few cases in Swedish children whose parents are also born in Sweden, the case rate is still high in foreign-born children, for example, 450/100,000 foreign-born Somali children. At the beginning of the past 45years, sentinel (infected in Sweden with no known source person) cases were a reality but they are rarely seen today. This may be attributed to better organization, contact tracing, screening, and early diagnosis in the adult population	['SDG03']

10.3390/ijerph15122693	Biomarkers of exposure to secondhand and thirdhand Tobacco smoke: Recent advances and future perspectives	Smoking is the leading preventable disease worldwide and passive smoking is estimated to be the cause of about 1.0% of worldwide mortality. The determination of tobacco smoke biomarkers in human biological matrices is key to assess the health effects related to the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. The biomonitoring of cotinine, the main nicotine metabolite, in human biofluids—including urine, serum or saliva—has been extensively used to assess this exposure. However, the simultaneous determination of cotinine together with other tobacco biomarkers and the selection of alternative biological matrices, such as hair, skin or exhaled breath, would enable a better characterization of the kind and extent of tobacco exposure. This review aims to perform a critical analysis of the up-to-date literature focused on the simultaneous determination of multiple tobacco smoke biomarkers studied in different biological matrices, due to the exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) and thirdhand smoke (THS). Target biomarkers included both tobacco-specific biomarkers—nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamine biomarkers—and tobacco-related biomarkers, such as those from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, metals and carbon monoxide. To conclude, we discuss the suitability of determining multiple biomarkers through several relevant examples of SHS and THS exposure.</jats:p	['SDG03']

10.1371/journal.ppat.1007441	Quantitative RNAseq analysis of Ugandan KS tumors reveals KSHV gene expression dominated by transcription from the LTd downstream latency promoter	KSHV is endemic in Uganda and the HIV epidemic has dramatically increased the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). To investigate the role of KSHV in the development of KS, we obtained KS biopsies from ART-naïve, HIV-positive individuals in Uganda and analyzed the tumors using RNAseq to globally characterize the KSHV transcriptome. Phylogenetic analysis of ORF75 sequences from 23 tumors revealed 6 distinct genetic clusters with KSHV strains exhibiting M, N or P alleles. RNA reads mapping to specific unique coding sequence (UCDS) features were quantitated using a gene feature file previously developed to globally analyze and quantitate KSHV transcription in infected endothelial cells. A pattern of high level expression was detected in the KSHV latency region that was common to all KS tumors. The clear majority of transcription was derived from the downstream latency transcript promoter P3(LTd) flanking ORF72, with little evidence of transcription from the P1(LTc) latency promoter, which is constitutive in KSHV-infected lymphomas and tissue-culture cells. RNAseq data provided evidence of alternate P3(LTd) transcript editing, splicing and termination resulting in multiple gene products, with 90% of the P3(LTd) transcripts spliced to release the intronic source of the microRNAs K1-9 and 11. The spliced transcripts encode a regulatory uORF upstream of Kaposin A with alterations in intervening repeat sequences yielding novel or deleted Kaposin B/C-like sequences. Hierarchical clustering and PCA analysis of KSHV transcripts revealed three clusters of tumors with different latent and lytic gene expression profiles. Paradoxically, tumors with a latent phenotype had high levels of total KSHV transcription, while tumors with a lytic phenotype had low levels of total KSHV transcription. Morphologically distinct KS tumors from the same individual showed similar KSHV gene expression profiles suggesting that the tumor microenvironment and host response play important roles in the activation level of KSHV within the infected tumor cells	['SDG03']

10.18332/tid/99574	Perceptions about the harmfulness of tobacco among adults in Uganda: Findings from the 2013 Global Adult Tobacco Survey	Introduction Preferential option for some tobacco products over others might be attributed to inherent misconceptions about the harmfulness of tobacco. We analysed data from Uganda’s Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) to assess misconceptions about the harmfulness of tobacco and associated factors.  Methods Data were obtained from the 2013 Uganda Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) of persons in Uganda of age ≥15 years among 8508 participants selected using a multi-stage sampling design to provide nationally representative estimates of the adult population. Participants were asked about perceptions of the harmfulness of smoking, using smokeless tobacco and whether all kinds of cigarettes are equally harmful. Weighted logistic regression analysis was used to find factors associated with the dependent variables.  Results Among daily smokeless tobacco users, 98 (62%) were unaware that smokeless tobacco causes serious illness. Compared with participants without formal education, participants with primary education were less likely to be unaware that smoking causes serious illness (AOR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.48–0.84) as were participants with secondary education (AOR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.19–0.42) and participants with University education or higher (AOR=0.26, 95% CI: 0.11–0.58). Compared with participants who did not use any smokeless tobacco products, participants who used smokeless tobacco products less than daily were more likely to be unaware that smokeless tobacco causes serious illness (AOR=1.39, 95% CI: 0.54–3.61) as were participants who used smokeless tobacco products daily (AOR=5.87, 95% CI: 3.67–9.40). Compared with participants who did not use any smoked tobacco products, participants who used smoked tobacco products less than daily were more likely to believe that all cigarettes are equally harmful (AOR=2.40, 95% CI: 1.32–4.37) as were participants who used smoked tobacco products daily (AOR=3.08, 95% CI: 2.37–4.00).  Conclusions There is a high level of unawareness about the harmfulness of tobacco use particularly among tobacco users. The National Tobacco Control Program should prioritise public awareness and education about the dangers of tobacco use in the Tobacco Control Policy and National Tobacco Control Strategic Plan	['SDG03']

10.1080/08958378.2018.1530316	The toxicology of air pollution predicts its epidemiology	Epidemiologic investigation has successively defined associations of air pollution exposure with non-malignant and malignant lung disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, pregnancy outcomes, perinatal effects, and other extra-pulmonary disease including diabetes. Defining these relationships between air pollution exposure and human health closely parallels results of earlier epidemiologic investigation into cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), two other particle-related exposures. Humic-like substances (HULIS) have been identified as a chemical component common to cigarette smoke and air pollution particles. Toxicology studies provide evidence that a disruption of iron homeostasis with sequestration of host metal by HULIS is a fundamental mechanistic pathway through which biological effects are initiated by cigarette smoke and air pollution particles. As a result of a common chemical component and a shared mechanistic pathway, it should be possible to extrapolate from the epidemiology of cigarette smoking and ETS to predict associations of air pollution exposure with human disease which are currently unrecognized. Accordingly, it is anticipated that forthcoming epidemiologic investigation will demonstrate relationships of air pollution with COPD causation, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, renal disease, digestive disease, loss of bone mass/risk of fractures, dental disease, eye disease, fertility problems, and extrapulmonary malignancies	['SDG03']

A study of interactive media based on film literacy experience	En este estudio hemos analizado el estado actual de la alfabetización mediática prestando especial atención al cine y los videojuegos. Hemos intentado analizar si algunos de los problemas encontrados a lo largo de la historia de la alfabetización cinematográfica han existido también en el proceso de la alfabetización en los videojuegos, intentando unificar ambas visiones para captar la atención de las personas que trabajan en el campo de los videojuegos. Para ello, el estudio abarca la alfabetización en los videojuegos en dos dimensiones, la dimensión cultural y la dimensión creativa. La dimensión cultural se define a partir de los enfoques críticos y educacionales y la creativa mediante el diseño y la programación. Estas investigaciones se han llevado a cabo sin dejar de lado la perspectiva de la alfabetización cinematográfica. Hemos descubierto que la alfabetización en los videojuegos tiene una fuerte tendencia hacia el enfoque cultural, sobre todo la vertiente educativa, y que los riesgos que plantea el enfoque crítico presentan problemas similares a los que se registran en los estudios sobre el cine. En cuanto a la dimensión creativa, hemos advertido una falta de inversión para el estudio y la investigación de prácticas de diseño y programación. En conclusión, creemos que la alfabetización en los videojuegos necesita un nivel de motivación. Estimamos urgente la implantación de una perspectiva de alfabetización basada en el diseño creativo y la programación, poniendo especial énfasis en el desarrollo del enfoque comunicativo.___________________________________________________In this study we have analysed the current state of media literacy focusing on the game and film art forms. We aim to discover if some problems found throughout the history of film literacy were also occurring in game literacy research. It is also our intention to bring both visions together in order to get the attention of people working in the gaming field. To do this we have studied the cultural and creative dimensions in game literacy. The study is defined culturally by educational and critical approaches, and creatively by design and programming. The study also takes into account film literacy perspectives. We found that game literacy has a strong bias towards the cultural rather than the educational approach. The critical component might face the same problems that occur in film literacy studies. In terms of the creative dimension, we found a lack of investment in and support for research in design and programming practices. In conclusion we believe more interest needs to be generated in game literacy and that the literacy perspective based on creative design and programming with an emphasis on communication instead of education should be the model to follo	['SDG04']

Despite the recognized benefits of peer review, it may not be feasible for every library to establish such a program. In an effort to aid those who are interested in peer review, but who may not be able to participate in a formal program, the authors identify the principles of peer review that can be applied on a non-programmatic basis. Six areas of best practice are described: establishing an environment of trust, respect, and confidentiality; selecting a suitable partner for the process; communicating with a peer reviewer; focusing on specific aspects of teaching where feedback is desired; making time for the process; and preparing oneself to accept criticism	['SDG04']

The purpose of this study, conducted in Melbourne, Australia, was to examine first-year Bachelor of Midwifery students' mental health literacy about post-partum women with schizophrenia, using the vignette of “Mary”. A non-probability sample of 38 commencing students was used. The results showed that the students had a mainly lay person-informed conceptualization of mental health interventions for post-partum women. They acknowledged that Mary had a mental health problem that might have a more favorable outcome with professional support, but this agreement did not extend to their understanding of the consequences of the failure to receive professional help. They believed that negative outcomes were less likely and positive outcomes were just as likely for Mary than for others in the community. The findings highlight the need for mental health theory and clinical subjects to be incorporated in midwifery curricula	['SDG04']
10.1177/1028315309357943	Compatibility between internationalizing and africanizing higher education in South Africa	Internationalisation of the higher education sector across the world has become the norm and this is also true for South African universities. Another dimension has with increasing intension moved into the foreground, namely the need to Africanise South African higher education. The imperatives of these two dimensions are often portrayed as polarised positions and it is thus perceived that the one negates the benefits of the other. This article argues that compatibility exists between internationalisation and Africanisation of higher education in South Africa. To substantiate this argument, the conceptualisation of internationalisation and the Africanising of South African higher education, from selected literature, is presented. Subsequently, it is shown why these two conceptualisations could be perceived as contradictory to each other, and hence some touch points for finding compatibility between them are identified. Some pointers for further research are also indicated. </jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1186/1752-4458-4-18	Mental health first aid training for the Chinese community in Melbourne, Australia: Effects on knowledge about and attitudes toward people with mental illness	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate in members of the Chinese community in Melbourne the impact of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training on knowledge about mental disorders and on attitudes to people with mental illness. The hypotheses were that at the end of the training participants would have increased knowledge of mental disorders and related treatments, and decreased negative attitudes towards people with mental disorders. METHODS: Respondents were 108 participants of three MHFA training workshops for the Chinese community in Melbourne conducted by a qualified MHFA trainer. Participants completed the research questionnaire prior to the commencement of the training (pre-test) and at its completion (post-test). The questionnaires assessed participants' ability to recognize a mental disorder (depression and schizophrenia) described in the vignettes, knowledge about the professional help and treatment, and negative attitudes towards people with mental illness. RESULTS: Between pre- and post-test there was significant improvement in the recognition of mental disorders, beliefs about treatment became more concordant with health professionals, and negative attitudes reduced. CONCLUSION: The MHFA training course for general members of the Chinese community in Melbourne produced significant positive change in the level of mental health literacy and reductions in stigmatizing attitudes. The evidence from this study, together with the accumulated evidence of the benefits of MHFA training in the general Australian community, suggests that this approach should be scaled up to a level where it can have an impact on the whole of the Chinese community in Australia	['SDG04']

Design-methodology-approach: The study employs a quantitative survey design. Findings: The findings indicate that the basic scientific and technological skills of reading critically and writing persuasively as well as accessing and using information efficiently have been achieved to a great extent in the context of the study; whereas, mathematical and scientific skills and global awareness and cross-cultural issues still need more attention. Variations in the level of mastery as well as gender differences in the achievement of certain skills clusters were also identified and discussed in light of the robustness of the theory of the universal digital native. Research limitations-implications: The results cannot be generalized into other contexts and the data were basically self-reported and not corroborated by evidence from triangulated sources. Practical implications: Effective dealing with the basic and technological skills should be continued; however, more attention should be given to the development of the skills in mathematics and the sciences. Likewise, the visual-literacy skills and the levels of global awareness and cross-cultural understanding and appreciation should be improved. Originality-value: This exploratory study fills a knowledge gap and may set the stage for further research into the extent to which the twenty-first century skills are being realized by institutions of higher learning given the scarcity or non-existence of this research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Using these interventions as quasi-experiments, I estimate malaria's effect on lifetime female educational attainment through the combination of pre-existing geographic variation in malarial intensity and cohort exposure based on the timing of the national anti-malaria campaigns. The estimates from Sri Lanka and Paraguay are similar and indicate that malaria eradication increased years of educational attainment and literacy. The similarity of the estimates across the countries reinforces our confidence in the validity of the identification strategy. (JEL I12, I18, I21, J16, O15, O18)	['SDG04']

Specifically, the study examined SLPs' knowledge, attitudes, and collaborative practices in the area of written language services as well as the variables that impact provision of these services.                                   Method             Public school–based SLPs from across the country were solicited for participation in an online, Web-based survey. Data from 645 full-time SLPs from 49 states were evaluated using descriptive statistics and logistic regression.                                   Results                            Many school-based SLPs reported not providing               any               services in the area of written language to students with written language weaknesses. Knowledge, attitudes, and collaborative practices were mixed. A logistic regression revealed three variables likely to predict high levels of service provision in the area of written language.                                                Conclusion             Data from the current study revealed that many struggling readers and writers on school-based SLPs' caseloads are not receiving services from their SLPs. Implications for SLPs' preservice preparation, continuing education, and doctoral preparation are discussed.           </jats:sec	['SDG04']

First, it was examined whether children’s working memory could be enhanced by a cognitive training program, and how the training outcomes would relate to their reading development. Next, it was explored how differential aspects of working memory are related to children’s reading outcomes. The working memory training yielded effects, and these effects appeared beneficial to children’s reading comprehension development. Working memory measures were found to be related with children’s word reading and reading comprehension. The results show that working memory can be seen as a crucial factor in the reading development of literacy among children with special needs, and that interventions to improve working memory may help children becoming more proficient in reading comprehension.</p	['SDG04']

These opinions present useful guidelines for both librarian and teacher practitioners.Originality/valueThis paper provides a point of view on the relationship between information literacy and library user education in the six themes described above.</jats:sec	['SDG04']
10.1177/0741932510362200	Disability studies in education: The need for a plurality of perspectives on disability	This article asserts that the field of special education, historically founded on conceptions of disability originating within scientific, psychological, and medical frame works, will benefit from acknowledging broader understandings of disability. Although well intended, traditional understandings of disability in special education have inadvertently inhibited the development of theory,limited research methods, narrowed pedagogical practice, and determined largely segregated policies for educating students with disabilities. Since the passage of P.L. 94-142, along with the growth of the Disability Rights Movements, meanings of disability have expanded and evolved, no longer constrained to the deficit-based medical model. For many individuals, disability is primarily best understood within social, cultural, and historical contexts. As career-long educators, the authors describe the emergence of Disability Studies in Education, illustrating ways it offers them the means to engage with longstanding tensions, limitations, and promises within their chosen field of special education-helping to reframe, accurately ground, and define their own research and practice. The authors call upon the field of special education to acknowledge and accept a greater plurality of perspectives about the nature of disability, recognizing the profound implications this raises for research, and viewing it as a welcome opportunity for ongoing dialogue. © 2011 Hammill Institute on Disabilities	['SDG04']
10.1162/edfp_a_00024	Long-run trends in school productivity: Evidence from Australia	Outside the United States, very little is known about long-run trends in school productivity. We present new evidence using two data series from Australia, where comparable tests are available back to the 1960s. For young teenagers (aged 13–14), we find a small but statistically significant fall in numeracy over the period 1964–2003 and in both literacy and numeracy over the period 1975–98. The decline is in the order of one-tenth to one-fifth of a standard deviation. Adjusting this decline for changes in student demographics does not affect this conclusion; if anything, the decline appears to be more acute. The available evidence also suggests that any changes in student attitudes, school violence, and television viewing are unlikely to have had a major impact on test scores. Real per child school expenditure increased substantially over this period, implying a fall in school productivity. Although we cannot account for all the phenomena that might have affected school productivity, we identify a number of plausible explanations. </jats:p	['SDG04']
10.1016/j.ecresq.2011.03.002	Contributions of emergent literacy skills to name writing, letter writing, and spelling in preschool children	The purpose of this study was to examine which emergent literacy skills contribute to preschool children’s emergent writing (name-writing, letter-writing, and spelling) skills. Emergent reading and writing tasks were administered to 296 preschool children aged 4–5 years. Print knowledge and letter-writing skills made positive contributions to name writing; whereas alphabet knowledge, print knowledge, and name writing made positive contributions to letter writing. Both name-writing and letter-writing skills made significant contributions to the prediction of spelling after controlling for age, parental education, print knowledge, phonological awareness, and letter-name and letter-sound knowledge; however, only letter-writing abilities made a significant unique contribution to the prediction of spelling when both letter-writing and name-writing skills were considered together. Name writing reflects knowledge of some letters rather than a broader knowledge of letters that may be needed to support early spelling. Children’s letter-writing skills may be a better indicator of children’s emergent literacy and developing spelling skills than are their name-writing skills at the end of the preschool year. Spelling is a developmentally complex skill beginning in preschool and includes letter writing and blending skills, print knowledge, and letter-name and letter-sound knowledge	['SDG04']
10.1177/0022487111409417	Teachers as civic agents: Toward a critical democratic theory of urban teacher development	Under the guise of increasing quality and accountability, many urban teacher education programs and professional development models characterize educators as mere transmitters of standardized content knowledge. The authors argue that such dehumanizing practices, which are rooted in the discourse of neoliberalism, prevent teachers from helping their students develop powerful literacies and civic skills. The authors seek to disrupt mainstream views about teaching and learning by instead envisioning the “Teacher as Civic Agent.” By reevaluating theories of schooling and democracy and analyzing a particular learning community that conceptualizes teachers as public intellectuals, this work aims to make an important theoretical shift in how educators, politicians, and policy makers think about the purpose of education in a democracy. The authors argue for new paradigm of teacher education in which teachers engage with local communities, become producers of knowledge, and work collectively in solidarity with their students to create social change. </jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1093/pa/gsr047	Citizenship, democracy and education in the UK: Towards a common framework for citizenship lessons in the four home nations	Citizenship has become a major topic for debate and the subject of public policy in recent years, as academics and policy-makers across the Western world have tried to understand and respond to what is widely seen as a weakening of democracy. In the UK, the increasing alienation of citizens from electoral politics has  manifested itself in a sharp fall in electoral turnout, membership of political parties and levels of public trust in the political class. In this context, citizenship  education provides an opportunity to address the demand-side of political participation by helping a diverse citizenry make sense of a complex political world and  by strengthening democracy through the promotion of active citizenship. This article explores the differences between the approaches to citizenship education that have been adopted in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and, in so doing, highlights policy lessons that can be drawn from these varied experiences.   It argues that the evidence suggests a common framework for citizenship education across the four home nations based on four key principles—political literacy, experiential learning, appropriate institutional structures and supplyside measures—would help promote active involvement by citizens in forms of political participation	['SDG04']

In order to understand the causes of these difficulties, it is important to quantify the risk factors passed from parents to their offspring. METHOD: 417 adults completed a protocol comprising a 15-item questionnaire rating reading and related skills and a scale assessing ADHD symptoms; 344 completed reading, nonword reading and spelling tests. RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis with four factors (Reading, Word Finding, Attention and Hyperactivity) provided a reasonable fit to the data. The Reading Factor showed robust correlations with measured literacy skills. Adults who reported as dyslexic, or rated their reading difficulties as more severe, gained lower scores on objective measures of literacy skills. Although the sensitivity of the new scale was acceptable, it tended to miss some cases of low literacy. CONCLUSIONS: Self-report scales of reading and of attention difficulties are useful for identifying adults with reading and attention difficulties which may confer risks on their children of related problems. It is important for research following children at family risk of dyslexia to be aware of these effects	['SDG04']

This article reports on findings from a study exploring the extent to which HIV education is reached to people with disabilities in South Africa, and the challenges faced by educators providing HIV prevention education to learners with disabilities. Method: A survey questionnaire completed by 34 schools for learners with special education needs in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Additional complimentary data were collected through interviews with a total of 21 members of staff at schools for learners with disabilities. Results: Respondents recognise the importance of providing HIV prevention education for people with disabilities. Staff reports some challenges in providing HIV prevention education: barriers to communication; discomfort about issues of sexuality and disability; disagreements among staff about what is appropriate content for sexual health education; and fears of promoting sexual activity. Conclusions: There is a need for HIV prevention education to be specifically customized to the needs of the specific population. A general programme, which is included as part of a general curriculum and generally tailored to “mainstream” schools, would need to be adapted according to specific needs and disabling barriers faced	['SDG04']

The study draws on sociocultural theories considering context and language use as tools for meaning making. Goffman's theories of stage setting and footing are used to analyse how the lecturer positions himself in relation to language use. The findings show that in the observed session the lecturer used code-switching as a tool to extend students’ academic literacy. Further, we found that he in most cases assigned different classroom spaces to different languages. Hence, English as the targeted language of instruction was used when the lecturer was standing at the board, the official teaching space, whereas French, a previously accepted language, was used in a semi-official space closer to the students. Kinyarwanda, the lecturer's and students’ first language, is not permitted as a medium of instruction, but was used when the lecturer was close to the students. We label this a personal space, where the lecturer changed code in order to improve interaction and students’ understanding. Such code-switching has cultural and historical traditions and is viewed in this study as a strategy to avoid misunderstandings and allow more equitable learning opportunities.Projektet har stöd av Sida/SARECNUR-LiU PhD-programme in Educatio	['SDG04']

10.2196/jmir.1703	eHealth literacy among college students: a systematic review with implications for eHealth education.	BACKGROUND: eHealth literacy refers to the ability of individuals to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic resources and apply such knowledge to addressing or solving a health problem. While the current generation of college students has access to a multitude of health information on the Internet, access alone does not ensure that students are skilled at conducting Internet searches for health information. Ensuring that college students have the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct advanced eHealth searches is an important responsibility particularly for the medical education community. It is unclear if college students, especially those in the medical and health professions, need customized eHealth literacy training for finding, interpreting, and evaluating health- and medical-related information available on the Internet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our review was to summarize and critically evaluate the evidence from existing research on eHealth literacy levels among college students between the ages of 17 and 26 years attending various 4-year colleges and universities located around the world. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on numerous scholarly databases using various combinations of relevant search terms and Boolean operators. The records were screened and assessed for inclusion in the review based on preestablished criteria. Findings from each study that met inclusion criteria were synthesized and summarized into emergent themes. RESULTS: In the final review we analyzed 6 peer-reviewed articles and 1 doctoral dissertation that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The number of participants in each reviewed study varied widely (from 34 to 5030). The representativeness of the results from smaller studies is questionable. All studies measured knowledge and/or behaviors related to college student ability to locate, use, and evaluate eHealth information. These studies indicated that many college students lack eHealth literacy skills, suggesting that there is significant room for improvement in college students’ ability to obtain and evaluate eHealth information. CONCLUSION: Although college students are highly connected to, and feel comfortable with, using the Internet to find health information, their eHealth literacy skills are generally sub par. College students, especially in the health and medical professions, would be well served to receive more customized college-level instruction that improves general eHealth literacy	['SDG04']

10.1016/j.nedt.2011.06.009	Promoting critical thinking and academic writing skills in nurse education	Although academic skills, conceptualised as writing and critical thinking, are a vital part of university studies, research indicates that many students leave without having mastered these skills effectively. This research also reflects on nursing students. Nursing could also be said to be hampered by a number of complex educational challenges that are likely to impact on the academic socialisation process in general. These challenges include being a relatively 'young' academic discipline, the 'theory-practice' divide, a knowledge bed lying on a complex intersection of two 'antithetical sciences' and, at least in the Scandinavian countries, an increasing number of nurse educators with a PhD in nursing science but with limited time to develop their own teaching skills. In combination, these challenges have the potential to act as stumbling blocks, both from a teaching and learning perspective. I would suggest that a departure in teaching from theoretical educational models, such as Lea and Street's 'academic literacies model,' including skills, socialisation and academic literacy models simultaneously, could be one of several ways forward to create a learning environment that takes these issues into account.</p	['SDG04']

10.1017/s0267190511000080	Teaching second languages for the workplace	Workplace culture and organization are evolving as they adapt to globalization and rapid technological development. Likewise, the nature and role of workplace language and the literacy demands of work are changing in the face of increasingly multicultural workplaces and global communication networks. Among these changes, recent research has highlighted the role that informal modes of interpersonal communication play in the functioning of the modern workplace. Successful participation in such interactions is seen as not just a question of fitting in socially, but of doing work through talk. Ethnographic research in the workplace has stressed the importance of understanding language by viewing it within its social setting and understanding the interactional norms of particular communities of practice. Research into language programs for the workplace reflects this shift in emphasis. In contrast to research in the field of language for specific purposes on the specialized vocabulary and formal registers of particular professions, a growing body of research focuses on teaching and learning the language of routine workplace interactions. This article reviews current research into the nature of workplace language, noting in particular the contributions from ethnographic and language socialization research. It then discusses research into four aspects of the content of language programs for the workplace: employability skills, interpersonal communication, intercultural and critical language awareness, and teaching focused on the employment interview.</jats:p	['SDG04']

This article reports on research into the student experience of enquiry in two tasks in a university pharmacy course. Students were required to investigate through a field trip how a community pharmacy operated to meet customer needs and the requirements of the Health System in which it operated. Students were also required to investigate interactions and other properties of particular medicines through an online research task. This study looked at the student experience of enquiry in these contexts and the implications of the findings of that investigation for the debate about how digital literacy might relate to experiences of effective enquiry. The study presents evidence that suggests aspects such as variation in approaches to enquiry are an indicator of the extent of student success rather than the technologies ‘per se’. Analysis of the student population data, interviews and open-ended comments in surveys identified qualitatively different experiences of enquiry in both the community pharmacy context and the online investigation. The outcomes suggest that the way students approach and conceive of enquiry is closely related to the quality of their outcomes, and that this appears to be a more significant factor in the nature of effective enquiry than their classification as digital natives as a result of their age	['SDG04']

Factors effective in reducing use of investigators’ time and expenses included limiting exclusion of data because of abnormal Mini-Cog scores by careful initial screening and avoiding repeated reminders or follow-up, collecting data in small groups, collapsing consent, dementia screening, and data collection into single sessions, as well as accommodating for sensory and literacy deficits.The cross-sectional, descriptive studies were conducted among community-dwelling older adults attending senior citizen centers and among older adults in independent or assisted living apartments within continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs).1 In the latest study, a convenience sample (N = 152) was recruited and data collection was completed in 4 weeks at a total cost of less than $5,000. Methods common to qualitative research and those commonly used in community-based research were adapted to reduce time and costs for recruitment, screening, and data collection. Given limited availability of research funding, other nursing researchers may find one or more of these methods useful.</jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1177/0895904811417589	The Effects of Educational Policy and Local Context on Special Education Students' Experiences of School Removal and Transition	This article examines school removals and transitions among nine special education students. First, the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the local school discipline policy and special education contexts are discussed. Next, drawing from participants’ narrative accounts, the ways in which policy mandates and contextual conditions shaped their individual experiences are examined. Findings reveal the significance of IDEA and the profound impact of educational policies on students having academic and disciplinary difficulties. I argue for further examinations of the “on-the-ground” effects of educational policies and for students and their families to have more power in school accountability. </jats:p	['SDG04']

This article describes a context in which cultural space, issues of identity, pragmatics of employment, family and community and a bureaucratic regulatory environment intersect to create scenarios that are multi-facetted and layered in complexity. As has been demonstrated clearly in other arenas (Richardson & Watt, 2006), the move towards professional teacher education qualification is not linear or straightforward. To add to the knowledge base in this area, the focus in this study is on university graduates of a teacher education degree targeting people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. This landscape of professional pathways offers material for educators and policy-makers to consider in the drive to 'close the gap' in Indigenous educational opportunity in Australia and in related circumstances elsewhere. Note that terms such as 'Aboriginal' and 'Indigenous peoples' are used as general signifiers and may not be the group terms favoured by the people to whom they refer, but have been accepted as place-holders for complex identifications of lineage and personal identification. Aboriginal peoples should also be aware that this paper may refer to people who are no longer with us.16 page(s	['SDG04']

It is our contention that our guiding professional information literacy definitions and standards need to be reconsidered in order to remain relevant within the global learning context. Our preliminary conclusion is that the predominantly skills-based approach facilitated by the current ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, is not sufficient to facilitate teaching of twenty-first century  deep information literacy,  which we feel encompasses additional content-based engagement with the social, cultural, economic and political contexts of information access, retrieval, use, and creation. Within the global education context, the ways we may engage with such an expanded notion of information literacy and the challenges associated with this, are discussed	['SDG04']
10.1108/00220411311295351	Connecting with new information landscapes: Information literacy practices of refugees	Purpose – The purpose of the research reported in this article is to understand how refugees learn to engage with a complex, multimodal information landscape and how their information literacy practice may be constructed to enable them to connect and be included in their new information landscape. Design/methodology/approach – The study is framed through practice and socio‐cultural theories. A qualitative research design is employed including semi‐structured face‐to‐face interviews and focus groups which are thematically analysed through an information practice lens. Findings – Refugees encounter complex and challenging information landscapes that present barriers to their full participation in their new communities. Social inclusion becomes possible where information is provided via sharing through trusted mediators who assist with navigating the information landscape and information mapping, and through visual and social sources. Research limitations/implications – The study is local and situated and therefore not empirically generalizable. It does however provide rich, deep description and explanation that is instructive beyond the specific research site and contributes to theory building. Practical implications – The study highlights the role, and importance, of social and visual information sources and the key role of service providers as mediators and navigators. Governments, funders and service providers can use these findings to inform their service provision. Originality/value – This is an original research paper in which the results provide practical advice for those working with refugees and which also extends theories of information literacy practice as an information practice.</jats:p	['SDG04']

10.5172/ijpl.2012.7.1.84	Teaching and assessment of persuasive writing: Juggling the language features and grasping the metalanguage	Being able to write persuasively has always been important. This skill is central to a range of genres such as comparative analysis, editorial or discussion. It is argued to be  the written genre that students will meet most frequently as they progress through their schooling (NAPLAN, 2010) and its mastery continues to be of paramount importance to passing high stakes/gate-keeping tests of English and being able to engage with tertiary studies (Wollman-Bonilla, 2004). Compared with writing a narrative the persuasive written text requires an understanding and application of specific persuasive devices as well as particular knowledge and understanding of the context in question. This draws attention to the need for the design of assessment tasks to firstly take account of students' background knowledge. Similarly, teachers need give priority to the explicit teaching of the associated language features, which in turn demands students' acquisition of the metalanguage involved. This research examined thirty-five Taiwanese high school students' responses to a persuasive writing task based on the task, criteria and descriptive data used for the Australian national test of literacy (NAPLAN, 2011a). Responding to 'Learning a language is better than learning a sport' students' scripts showed a range of performance but overall strong evidence of understanding the persuasive genre and the ability to apply persuasive devices. These devices included use of personal opinion, appeals to reader's logic or values, conditional and emphatic statements, and ability to temper or modify their argument	['SDG04']

To minimize the influence of linguistic competence on the assessment, the ASD print-related profile was compared with that of a language-matched sample of typically developing peers. Two factors associated with young children’s print-related achievements, their print motivation and home-based experiences, were illustrated for the matched participants. We found that children with ASD earned significantly higher scores on a parentally reported composite measure of emergent procedural (e.g., letter name identification) than conceptual (e.g., pretend reading) print-related accomplishments. The children with ASD were more often reported by their parents as motivated by letters but less likely to request or enjoy shared reading than their language-matched peers. Findings provide a preliminary profile of emergent print-related accomplishments that may be considered in educational planning for children with ASD. </jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1177/2165143413476545	Student Engagement and Leadership of the Transition Planning Process	The Council for Exceptional Children’s Division on Career Development and Transition (DCDT) has been a longstanding leader and advocate in the field of secondary education for students with disabilities. This paper traces the history of student engagement in transition planning primarily through the lens of DCDT’s journal Career Development for Exceptional Individuals, now known as Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals. Student engagement in the transition planning process implies meaningful student participation in Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meetings, including both student leadership of IEP meetings and presenting IEP results during meetings, student engagement in the transition planning process, participation in and understanding of transition assessment results, and the attainment of annual IEP transition goals. The idea of student engagement in the transition planning process was initially delivered in a larger context, and then across the years, the topic became the primary focus of specific articles. We trace this development and conclude by speculating where student engagement in transition planning will go in the future. Suggestions are offered for both research and practice.Yeshttps://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/manuscript-submission-guideline	['SDG04']

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) framework (aligned with, and an outcome of, the TQM movement) provides a set of criteria for organizational quality assessment and improvement in the business, healthcare and education sectors. Given the imperative to improve the quality of schools in Mauritius, this study was designed to investigate the usefulness of the widely accepted MBNQA framework in the Mauritian context.Design/methodology/approachA nationwide questionnaire survey of school principals explored the nature and strength of the Baldrige theory of relationships between leadership, systems and processes of primary and secondary schools and the ensuing outcomes. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted.FindingsThe findings indicate that Mauritian school leaders play a critical role in influencing school outcomes directly and indirectly through the inner workings of the schooling system.Research limitations/implicationsThe research relied on principals’ views as the unique source of data about school leadership. The perspectives of the other stakeholders within schools, including teachers, students and parents, should also count and would offer a richer description of leadership reality in Mauritian schools.Originality/valueThis is the first ever study assessing empirically the notion of “quality” in primary and secondary schools in Mauritius at the national level.

It is an emerging domain of technology extending on previous maps studies and positioning technology. We draw upon ethnographic field studies of collaborative hunting, where hunting dogs are tracked and their location made visible on digital maps. We discuss mobility of two differ- ent kinds. First, we refer to mobility as the practice of physical movements of hunters, dogs and prey. Second, we refer to the movement of symbolic objects on a digital map screen, i.e. screen mobility, and the interpretational work that the hunters do to make sense of it. Representations of motion on a screens, are of ongoing practical concern for the hunters. We show how they interpret such mobility in terms of accelerations, distance, trajectories and temporal alignments. The findings are used to revisit mobility theo- ries and populate them with new notions to inspire design in broad domains.</p	['SDG04']

10.1177/0272989x13484389	Expressing death risk as condensed life experience and death intensity	Some risk exposures, including many medical and surgical procedures, typically carry hazards of death that are difficult to convey and appreciate in absolute terms. I propose presenting the death risk as a condensed life experience (i.e., the equivalent amount of life T that would carry the same cumulative mortality hazard for a person of the same age and sex based on life tables). For example, if the risk of death during an elective 1-hour procedure is 0.01%, and same-age and same-sex people have a 0.01% death risk over 1 month, one can inform the patient that “this procedure carries the same death risk as living 1 month of normal life.” Comparative standards from other risky activities or from a person with the same disease at the same stage and same predictive profile could also be used. A complementary metric that may be useful to consider is the death intensity. The death intensity λ is the hazard function that shows the fold-risk estimate of dying compared with the reference person. The death intensity can vary substantially for different phases of the event, operation, or procedure (e.g., intraoperative, early postoperative, late postoperative), and this variability may also be useful to convey. T will vary depending on the time window for which it is computed. I present examples for calculating T and λ using literature data on accidents, ascent to Mount Everest, and medical and surgical procedures. </jats:p	['SDG04']

In this study, using early project data, we examine FVNP teachers’ self‑reported pedagogic content knowledge and classroom practice from initial and follow up questionnaires, as well as interviews from case study teachers. After the first FVNP year, teachers reported being better able to plan focused mathematics lessons and to monitor student learning. On the other hand, teachers also felt less able to make mathematics explicit to students and their confidence in providing engaging activities declined. With the caveat that these findings are preliminary, we discuss possible reasons for these changes and implications for teachers’ professional learning	['SDG04']

Although these countries have made much progress in getting young children into school, school dropout after age 11 was still very high, and in the rural areas there were major gender differences in participation. In cities of most of these countries (except Yemen) gender differences have almost disappeared. Multivariate analyses show that similar household-level factors (e.g. wealth, education, number of siblings) as those in the West play a role, but that their importance relative to context factors is much less. For young rural girls, only 33 per cent of the variation in participation is explained by household-level factors. For older and urban girls and for boys this is more, but still substantially less than in the West. Strengthening the position of rural mothers and improving the educational infrastructure seem particularly important for reducing gender differences.22 p	['SDG04']

This was an independent review commissioned by the UK government to evaluate provision for children with dyslexia and literacy difficulties, and to make recommendations on how the identification, teaching and educational outcomes of these pupils might be improved. While this focus on the needs of dyslexic children is welcomed, dyslexia causes life-long difficulties so it is important also to consider the needs of dyslexic adults. Many of these adults may have gone through their school lives and into employment with little, if any, dedicated dyslexia support. There is a need, therefore, to increase awareness of what can be done (and legally, what should be done) to meet the practical and emotional needs of these individuals.     This is the goal of this book which is aimed at dyslexic adults and professionals who support them in higher education and the workplace. These professionals might include educational and occupational psychologists, specialist dyslexia tutors, speech and language therapists, careers advisors, disability advisors and welfare officers. The book also offers a wealth of practical advice to employers on how best to meet the specific needs of their dyslexic staff, and it highlights some of the skills and strengths that dyslexic adults can bring to the workplace	['SDG04']

Fourteen participants with autism and mild to moderate intellectual disability (mean age = 24.6 years) were recruited. The workplace training programme included practices in work context and group educational sessions. A pre-test–post-test design was used with the Work Personality Profile, the Scale of Independent Behaviour Revised and the Observational Emotional Inventory Revised to evaluate the targeted behaviours. Improvement in social and communication skills specific to the workplace was achieved. For emotional control, participants became less confused and had a better self-concept. However, improvement in other general emotional behaviours, such as impulse control, was limited. The results indicated that a structured workplace training programme aimed at improving social, communication and emotional behaviours can be helpful for people with autism and intellectual disability. Further study with a larger sample size and a control group is recommended. The development of specific programme to cater for the emotional control needs at workplace for people with autism is also suggested	['SDG04']

The most important research results are: a) the validity of the design and implementation of the training, b) the forming of an effective Community of Practice for Roma women in virtual learning environments, and c) the significant changes in the participants that can favor the cultural promotion of women. It provides a new model of ICT-based educational intervention in CSCL, aimed at improving training for and promotion of sociocultural groups in situations of social exclusion.  Este artículo describe los resultados de investigación de un estudio sobre la conformación de una comunidad de práctica a través de e-learning social y aprendizaje colaborativo en entornos virtuales (CSCL). La muestra está formada por 20 mujeres gitanas adultas y residentes en Extremadura (España) heterogéneas en edad, nivel formativo y actividad laboral. El estudio parte de la contextualización y posterior diseño, implementación y evaluación de una acción formativa de e-learning sobre igualdad de oportunidades y liderazgo social. Posteriormente, analiza el contenido de foros del curso, según las dimensiones del modelo «Comunidad de Indagación» que es una de las perspectivas teóricas más prometedoras sobre e-learning y enfoques constructivistas colaborativos y que ha sido desarrollada en cientos de estudios durante la última década. Y, por último, evalúa la experiencia formativa, utilizando la triangulación como procedimiento para el análisis de datos. Se destacan como resultados la validez del diseño y aplicación de la acción formativa; la conformación efectiva de la comunidad de práctica de mujeres gitanas en entornos virtuales de enseñanza-aprendizaje colaborativos; y los cambios significativos en las mujeres participantes que favorecen su promoción socio-cultural. Se aporta un nuevo modelo de intervención socioeducativa con TIC basado en CSCL, destinado a la mejora de la formación y a la promoción sociocultural de los grupos en situación de exclusión social.</jats:p	['SDG04']
10.1163/15692108-12341251	Decolonizing educational and social development platforms in Africa	Abstract This essay aims to engage, mainly from theoretical perspectives with analytical eclecticism, a historical and contemporary analysis of African educational and social developmental contexts. It relays the real colonial connections that are still attached to this context. The essay relates the historical location as well as the socio-cultural embeddedness of the African philosophy of Ubuntu, which may have indirectly facilitated the initial entry of colonialism. It critically locates the thick philosophical and epistemological problematics that have previously and again, post-factually limited the foundational reconstructions, and by extension, the relevance of Africa’s learning and related possibilities for achieving social well-being. At the end, the essay calls for the urgent decolonization of Africa’s philosophies and epistemologies of education, so that learning contexts can aid the now non-delinkable desires, indeed, needs for social development. </jats:sec	['SDG04']

10.1111/desc.12153	The roles of family history of dyslexia, language, speech production and phonological processing in predicting literacy progress	It is well established that speech, language and phonological skills are closely associated with literacy, and that children with a family risk of dyslexia (FRD) tend to show deficits in each of these areas in the preschool years. This paper examines what the relationships are between FRD and these skills, and whether deficits in speech, language and phonological processing fully account for the increased risk of dyslexia in children with FRD. One hundred and fifty‐three 4–6‐year‐old children, 44 of whom had FRD, completed a battery of speech, language, phonology and literacy tasks. Word reading and spelling were retested 6 months later, and text reading accuracy and reading comprehension were tested 3 years later. The children with FRD were at increased risk of developing difficulties in reading accuracy, but not reading comprehension. Four groups were compared: good and poor readers with and without FRD. In most cases good readers outperformed poor readers regardless of family history, but there was an effect of family history on naming and nonword repetition regardless of literacy outcome, suggesting a role for speech production skills as an endophenotype of dyslexia. Phonological processing predicted spelling, while language predicted text reading accuracy and comprehension. FRD was a significant additional predictor of reading and spelling after controlling for speech production, language and phonological processing, suggesting that children with FRD show additional difficulties in literacy that cannot be fully explained in terms of their language and phonological skills	['SDG04']

The consequence is that almost everything we do may be said to contain weak attributes of ESD even if we know nothing significant about it. This paper attempts to reveal an understanding of ESD that is informed by an exploration of policy language and agenda and recent literature in the field. The exploration of policy reveals the possible cause for previous inadequate implementation of ESD. An exploration of policy and literature reveals some key competencies that are advocated for through ESD. Insight into how policy has shifted from an ecological to a development focus and substantiation for why this shift is important in addressing current sustainable development issues serves to inform the interpretation of ESD. Finally, the analysis of policy and literature is triangulated to develop a framework that may assist ESD stakeholders in identifying ESD competencies in policy and practice. It is hoped that through this engagement with selected texts a more informed and complex insight into ESD and its features may be developed</jats:p"	['SDG04']

Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were performed, controlled for potential confounders.ResultsFifty percent of the women responded (N = 275). Thirteen percent had low and 41% had medium subjective HL. Women with low HL reported less perceived information provision about medical tests, and were less satisfied with the information received compared to women with high HL. Low educated women reported that they received more information about their disease compared to highly educated women.ConclusionLow subjective HL among women with ovarian tumors is associated with less perceived information provision about medical tests and lower information satisfaction, whereas low education is associated with more perceived information provision about the disease.Practice implicationsHL should not be overlooked as a contributing factor to patients’ perceived information provision and satisfaction. Health care providers may need training about recognizing low HL	['SDG04']

The 1953 Bantu Education Act became infamous for limiting African educational opportunities. Yet this article shows how women in Umlazi Township, outside of Durban, schooled their children – despite and indeed because of apartheid's oppressive educational and urban policies. Drawing on oral histories and archival records, it explores the ‘bond of education’, the gendered material-emotional family connections that enabled schooling and resulted from schooling. In the face of increasingly insecure intimate relations, a booming economy, and expanded basic education, mothers' attention to their children's and grandchildren's education grew in importance and scale: education required sacrifices but promised children's eventual support.</jats:p	['SDG04']

This research may contribute to the growing body of knowledge that has begun to explore attitudes and intentions of individuals for self-employment in a developing country.                                           Design/methodology/approach                 – This is an initial part of a longitudinal study in which survey instrument has been adapted for data collection. A random sampling was applied to the students of public and private higher educational institutions of a developing country. For data analysis, Statistical Package for Social Science 20 versions for Windows were used to test the hypotheses through descriptive, Pearson’s correlations and multiple regression analysis techniques.                                           Findings                 – Results of the study showed that all variables are reliable and valid. However, internal consistency among the variables has been found. By using Pearson’s correlations, entrepreneurship intention was found to be significantly and positively correlated to attitudes towards entrepreneurship. A high correlation was found between entrepreneurship intentions and attitudes towards behaviour and low correlation was between innovation and attitudes towards behaivour. However, all independent variables were found positively and significantly related to dependent variable except personal control.                                           Research limitations/implications                 – This study possess limitations such as only quantitative data were obtained for educational institutions. Second limitation is collecting data from small number of samples. Third limitation is use of few variables with direct relationship approach. This study may support the management and practitioners of human resources management and organisational behaviour in assessing and evaluating employee attitudes and behaviours in the organisation.                                           Originality/value                 – Based on real facts, this study provides empirical considerable evidence of individuals’ attitudes and intentions towards the entrepreneurship. Results indicate that that TPB theory factors such as attitudes towards the behaviour, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control and personal and social attitudinal characteristic like achievement, self-esteem, and innovation are important for the development of entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions             </jats:sec	['SDG04']

An Experimental Assessment in a Low-Income Population	Although programs designed to increase financial literacy are widely promoted, there is little evidence of their impact on financial knowledge or behavior. The present study used an experimental design to examine the effectiveness of a financial literacy course for low-income individuals receiving services in a nonprofit residential program. Participants were randomly assigned either to a 4-week financial literacy course (n = 17) or a wait-list control group (n = 16). They then completed measures designed for the purposes of this study assessing financial knowledge (e.g., which loan payments should take priority), negative behaviors (e.g., overdrawing a financial account), and positive behaviors (e.g., leaving money in a savings account). Results of this randomized experiment confirmed that the course increased both financial knowledge and positive financial behaviors, thereby lending support for the continued use of such financial education programs. Attrition was high in this study, however, and future research might explore alternative formats or approaches to presenting the course material	['SDG04']

With the intent of encouraging student–teacher understandings to move beyond prior knowledge through dynamic scholarship, a case-study methodology was embedded across the pedagogical approach in an intensively taught Indigenous education core unit. The data consisted of an in-depth examination of five pre-service teachers’ assignments for levels of reflective language, and degree of orientation towards discourses in Indigenous education as associated with the assessment criteria. The findings support prior research in asserting core units in Indigenous education for pre-service teachers as paramount for developing teacher competencies, and argues careful consideration when deeming a graduate ready to teach according to the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers.</jats:p	['SDG04']
10.1108/pmm-12-2014-0044	Laying the groundwork for information literacy at a research university	Purpose                 – Information literacy (IL) is increasingly becoming an explicit learning outcome for college graduates, and some libraries are playing a role in planning and teaching IL instruction to students. Amidst the overall trend of shrinking budgets that libraries are experiencing, what strategies can be employed by libraries that support large universities to plan IL instruction? The paper aims to discuss these issues.                                           Design/methodology/approach                 – Inspired by curriculum mapping, staff in the library assessment department created teaching maps which match the curriculum from seven colleges with the library’s teaching efforts. To create them, they combined information about: first, courses that librarians have instructed over the last three years with; second, required courses for majors within the colleges; and third, typical enrollment for each course.                                           Findings                 – Easily accessible information was combined to create the teaching maps, which enable the library to realign efforts to maximize IL instruction and best utilize library staff resources.                                           Practical implications                 – Teaching maps serve as a portal to quickly understand majors, courses and course enrollment, and provide baseline information on past library instruction activity to inform future IL instruction strategy. Library directors and teaching staff are utilizing them to realign instruction efforts.                                           Originality/value                 – Assessment strategies, such as curriculum mapping, serve not only the institution’s teaching mission, but also help strategize for effective and efficient stewardship of staff resources. These methods will be useful for library directors, assessment and instruction librarians at large research universities.             </jats:sec	['SDG04']

10.1007/s40299-014-0179-0	A Sociocognitive-Transformative Instructional Materials Design Model for Second Language (L2) Pedagogy in the Asia Pacific: Development and Validation	The current developments in second language (L2) pedagogy and the introduction of twenty-first century education compel scholars, educators, and leading education agencies in the Asia Pacific region to revisit their respective curriculum and framework for designing and preparing their English language teaching materials. However, after surveying available literature and studies in L2 pedagogy, it could be posited that there is paucity of a materials design model that would address these developments. Hence, this paper offers a sociocognitive-transformative materials design model to guide ESL and EFL teachers, material developers, and publishers in the Asia Pacific region in preparing instructional materials based on sound theories, principles, and practices. The process of model development was anchored on the grounded theory which allows a theory or model to emerge from the data. In the context of this study, the data (i.e., scholarly literature) was obtained from the top journals in applied linguistics and second language pedagogy. It is from these data that the preliminary model was developed. Using a three-pronged validation approach, findings confirmed the robustness of the model from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The findings further confirm the possibility of integrating current and relevant pedagogical concepts without contradicting one another and without contradicting other established L2 pedagogical frameworks. © 2014, De La Salle University	['SDG04']

10.1680/ensu.14.00007	Teaching sustainability to first year civil engineering students	The role of, and need for, universities to create and promote a holistic approach to engineering is a key part of developing sustainability literacy among future engineers. This paper reports on three different, but linked, exercises that teach undergraduates the complexity of sustainability in civil engineering. In the first exercise, students prepared a written commentary on an exploration of their campus locale to identify typical civil engineering issues such as construction trends over time and set these against economic and social demands and impacts at a city scale. The second exercise asked students to rank the importance of components of sustainable communities as a civil engineer, and then rank them separately as a citizen. In the third exercise, ten groups of approximately ten students were led through a discussion around a holistic approach to engineering and the impact of civil engineering infrastructure development. These exercises provide students with an understanding of hard-to-measure boundary conditions, more informally ‘context’, which can surround the technical excellence at the heart of civil engineering systems. The paper reports student feedback and discusses implications for teaching sustainability. The exercises and experiences presented in this paper can be utilised by other civil engineering degree providers. </jats:p	['SDG04']

An evaluation of the effect of english-only and compulsory schooling laws on immigrants	We provide the first estimates of the effect of statutes requiring English as the language of instruction and compulsory schooling laws on the school enrollment, work, literacy, and English fluency of immigrant children during the Americanization period (1910–1930). English-only statutes moderately increased the literacy of certain foreign-born children, particularly those living in cities or whose parents were not fluent in English. However, these laws had no impact on immigrants' eventual labor market outcomes or measures of social integration (from 1940 census and WWII enlistment records). Only laws regulating the age when children could work significantly affected immigrant outcomes. (JEL I21, I26, I28, J13, J15, N31, N32) </jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1177/1468798414566702	‘Go Be a Writer’: Intra-activity with materials, time and space in literacy learning	This article is based on research in a United States second-grade classroom during a multimodal literacy workshop. Observing students working with tissue paper, foam board, string, pipe cleaners and other materials, we asked how is intra-activity with materials, time and space influencing literacy learning in Room 203? While the research partnership of the authors spanned four years, video and audio recordings, artefacts and interviews with children for this article focus on year two of the research. Poststructural enquiry methods of pedagogical documentation and thinking with theory were used for data production and analysis. Pedagogical documentation focuses not only on the expected ways of being and learning (in this case, the norms of writing in an early childhood classroom) but also on unexpected occurrences (departures from what is typical or developmental) when students write. Thinking with poststructural and posthumanist theories allowed us to explore time, space and materials with three ideas: departures from the expected, the notion of becoming and intra-activity with materials. We illustrate how intra-activity with materials, time and space manifested in two projects: a 3D birdhouse and a 19-foot giraffe mural. We encourage educators to consider how expanded definitions of writing that include intra-actions with a range of materials create learning opportunities for children to live out literacy desiring with multimodal artefacts. </jats:p	['SDG04']
10.1016/j.psychres.2015.05.064	The Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS): A new scale-based measure of mental health literacy	Although Mental Health Literacy (MHL) has been a topic of substantial interest, measurement of this concept using a scale-based measure has been limited, including a lack of psychometric and methodologically robust scale-based measures of MHL. This study developed a new scale-based measure of MHL, the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS), which assesses all attributes of MHL. Construction of the MHLS was done over three key stages, including measure development, pilot testing and assessment of psychometrics and methodological quality. The resulting measure is a 35 item, univariate scale that is easily administered and scored. Results showed significant differences in scores between mental health professionals and a community sample, as well as individuals with greater experience with mental health, and a significant positive relationship with help-seeking intentions. The MHLS also demonstrated good internal and test–retest reliability. Evaluation of the methodological quality of the MHLS indicated that it has substantial methodological advantages in comparison to existing scale-based measures of MHL. The MHLS can be used in assessing individual and population level differences in MHL and in determining the impact of programmes designed to improve MHL.Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyFull Tex	['SDG04']
10.1080/07294360.2014.911262	Supporting Australian Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal nursing students using mentoring circles: an action research study	Attempts to recruit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students into nursing degrees have made minimal impact on the number of registered nurses working in Australia's healthcare sector. Yet increasing the number of Indigenous nurses remains one of the most important objectives in strategies to close the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Poor retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in a Bachelor of Nursing Science degree offered in far north Queensland, Australia, indicates the need for a different approach to support and retain Indigenous students. This action research study used a decolonizing methodology and was conducted at a satellite university campus in a remote Torres Strait Island community. Researchers trialled the use of a mentoring circle to support and retain nursing students and interviewed mentors and mentees about their experiences. Grounded theory methods were used to analyse the data. Findings indicated a growth in participant students' emotional intelligence as a result of participating in a mentoring circle. Students developed confidence, formed a group identity, better-negotiated the university environment, became more effective communicators and supported one another through difficulties. The mentoring circle model improved students' university experience and its use should be considered by tertiary educators working with Indigenous students	['SDG04']

In this regard, one of the abilities that are in  the spot of research is emergent writing, which is defined by Byington and Kim (2017) as young  children’s first attempts at the writing process; however, several studies have been focused on  emergent writing development in children's first language. Hence, the aim of this research  project was to articulate and determine translanguaging and play-based and their impact on  children’s emergent writing development in English. Five lessons were implemented considering  translanguaging and play-based strategies with 10 kindergarten children from a private school in  Pereira. Results from the analysis provide evidence that the emergent writing aspects such as  stages, features, constructive aspects, and domains, were affected by translanguaging goals and  strategies and play-based abilities. Implications for understanding emergent writing development  as means of lesson plans, categories of emergent writing, and theory are discussed.Académicos en el área de educación bilingüe utilizan el término bialfabetización  emergente para referirse a habilidades como pensar, escribir, leer, hablar y escuchar que poseen  los niños en dos lenguas (Reyes, 2006, p. 269). En este sentido, una de las habilidades que es de  interés en el campo investigativo es la escritura emergente, que es definida por Byington & Kim  (2017) como los primeros intentos que realiza un niño durante su proceso de escritura; sin  embargo, muchos estudios se han enfocado en el desarrollo de la escritura emergente en la  lengua materna de los niños. Por lo tanto, el objetivo de este proyecto de investigación fue  articular y determinar el impacto que el translingüísmo y el juego tuvo con respecto al desarrollo  de la escritura en inglés. Cinco clases fueron implementadas utilizando estrategias de  translingüísmo y juego con 10 niños de kinder de un colegio privado en Pereira. Los resultados  del análisis de datos ofrecen evidencia de qué aspectos de la escritura emergente entre ellos  etapas, características, aspectos constructivos y dominios fueron afectados por las estrategias y  metas del translingüísmo y por las habilidades del juego. Finalmente, se discuten las  implicaciones para comprender el desarrollo de la escritura emergente por medio de las  planeaciones de clase, las categorías de escritura y la revisión de la literatura de la escritura  emergente.MaestríaMagíster en Educación BilingüeContents

10.1080/02602938.2015.1082174	Students’ writing ‘in transition’ from A-levels to university: how assessment drives students’ understandings, practices and discourses	The lament that ‘students can’t write’ remains loud and defiant, even after years of research pointing to the myriad factors that make students’ writing challenging, particularly when they move into university. This paper reports on a longitudinal, ethnographic study which explored students’ writing ‘in transition’, from A-levels to university in the UK, through the critical lens offered by the academic literacies conceptual framing. This paper offers critical analysis of the ways that students, teachers and institutions position writing at A-level and university, exploring the assumptions and beliefs that underpin their understandings and practices using Ivanič’s framework of discourses of writing. The analysis proposes that the centrality of assessment in the treatment of language at both levels creates an ‘assessment discourse of writing’, which originates in school, and becomes a defining and restrictive frame for students’ writing as they move into higher education. The analysis further suggests that assessment is the principal cause for the students’ challenges with adapting to the writing requirements of university. Moreover, assessment is used as a metalanguage for discussing writing at A-levels, and can become an unhelpful ‘anchor of continuance’ for students as they move into university	['SDG04']

However, these groups of professionals may have insufficient opportunity in their professional study to develop the shared knowledge, perceptions and attitudes required for effective collaboration. This study examined the knowledge and perceptions of student teachers and student SLTs in the areas of language concepts, junior school literacy curriculum, service delivery and professional collaboration. An online survey was completed by 58 student primary school teachers and 37 student SLTs in their final year of professional study. The results indicated that these groups possessed limited understanding of each other’s expertise in literacy curriculum and spoken language concepts. Both groups demonstrated minimal knowledge of spoken–written language relationships and how SLTs can assist to develop children’s orthographic knowledge. Participants demonstrated acceptance of indirect methods of classroom-based service delivery (e.g. SLT acting as a consultant) but were less accepting of direct methods of classroom-based service delivery (e.g. shared teaching). Both groups also reported minimal experience with SLT–teacher collaboration during their pre-service education. The data suggest pre-service inter-professional education (IPE) with a focus on children’s early literacy learning is warranted to prepare prospective SLTs and teachers for collaborative instruction that enhances children’s communication. </jats:p	['SDG04']

All children completed assessments of reading comprehension, word reading accuracy, speechreading and vocabulary.Outcomes and resultsRegression analyses showed that vocabulary and speechreading accounted for unique variance in both reading accuracy and comprehension for deaf children. For hearing children, vocabulary was an independent predictor of both reading accuracy and comprehension skills but speechreading only accounted for unique variance in reading accuracy.Conclusions and implicationsSpeechreading and vocabulary are important for reading development in deaf children. The results are interpreted within the Simple View of Reading framework and the theoretical implications for deaf children's reading are discussed	['SDG04']

These colleges seldom offer inclusive education services; since 2007, however, the University of Iceland has offered a Vocational Diploma in inclusive settings for students with intellectual disabilities. In this article we report on qualitative research carried out in 2009–2013 among 39 graduated students with intellectual disabilities from the University of Iceland and 14 lecturers who have taught inclusive college courses. The findings suggest that, despite some reservations, there seems to be a common agreement that this initiative is an important part of improving the access of disabled people both to education and society. The courses are inclusive, that is, offered to disabled and non-disabled students at the School of Education studying at the undergraduate level. The graduated students described increased social participation, knowledge and self-esteem. The lecturers described the inclusive courses as positive both for non-disabled and disabled students. The employment outcomes for graduated students have in general been positive	['SDG04']

In Barbados this has been perceived as disengagement from conventional literate practices and has caused concern in the wider Barbadian community. This view is reinforced by the seemingly ubiquitous engagement of youth with various forms of communications technology rather than traditional text. This chapter presents some insight, in the context of a Barbadian secondary school, into an action research project which sought to bridge the existing divide between traditional and semiotic literacies. This investigation confirmed that students were engaged in literate acts in diverse ways. The creation of third space required revised assumptions about the nature of literacy and redefined roles for teachers and students. This chapter concludes with recommendations for increased dialogue, collaboration and professional development among Barbadian secondary English teachers on issues related to literacy.</jats:p	['SDG04']

The kit is based on two Spanish literacy methods: global and phonics. In this work, we present a qualitative study based on video-recorded sessions with twelve children from a Down syndrome institution. The study analyzes three forms of interactions: cardboard, multi-touch and tangible. The task carried out by special education teachers and children in the experimental sessions involved working in pairs (Teacherchild) and autonomous self-learning (child only). Through the sessions, we identified situations in which the teacher took the control in the cardboard version. In the multi-touch version, both the teacher and the child shared the control. However in the tangible version the child took the control. In the self-learning sessions, we observed that multi-touch and tangible interaction seems to offer an enjoyable time for children. Surveys and interviews with teachers revealed that tangible objects offered greater adaptability to create playful reading strategies. © 2015 ACM	['SDG04']

Die navorsing is uitgevoer in die vorm van h opname wat gedoen is onder h steekproef skoolhoofde en opvoeders in die Noordwes-Provinsie. Die resultate toon dat skoolhoofde uit voorheen bevoordeelde groepe hulle in h groter mate as sorgsaam evalueer as voorheen benadeelde skoolhoofde.

Opvoeders uit voorheen benadeelde groepe ervaar self h mindere mate van sorg, veral ten opsigte van die werkplek-bepalers. Skoolhoofde behoort meer opleiding te ontvang in emosionele intelligensie en die ander psigologiese aspekte van sorg.

LCA analyses emissions and resource extractions from mining and processing of resources (cradle) to disposal of wastes and residuals (grave) and even back to cradle. This paper plans to contribute in developing an online-based information system which provides an interdisciplinary approach to teach IE and LCA for sustainable industrial development. Specifically, the aims of this e-learning project are: (1) To develop innovative teaching and learning materials in line with flipped classroom strategies and (2) To create a one-stop Blackboard in support of learning the principles and concepts of IE and LCA for Sustainable Production and Consumption. Though the developed materials are used first to support faceto- face learning, this is being leveraged to meet demand for distance/online LCA education in the near future.	['SDG04']

Walt Disney Studios made four short films that were designed to teach illiterate residents of Latin Americahow to read and write. In Mexico, this project was initially backed by the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) under Jaime Torres Bodet, who appointed Eulalia Guzmán to be the SEP’s representative and thus to support the program. Walt Disney asked her to work out a pedagogical proposal for the educational films. This article analyzes the proposal, the development and production of these shorts, and their reception in Mexico. It foregrounds Guzmán’s criticisms of these educational materials, which led the OIAA representatives to withdraw them from circulation.</jats:p	['SDG04']
10.1515/libri-2016-0037	Does Africa's LIS Education Address New Forms of Digital Content and Related Right?	Abstract                As the case is elsewhere in the world, Library and Information Science (LIS) education in Africa is largely lagging behind industry developments with reference to the legal and policy framework regulating digital content and technology. Notwithstanding the importance of information ethics, LIS programmes in Africa tend to predominantly focus on ethical issues at the expense of legal issues. For most LIS programmes, the national legal and policy infrastructure regulating digital technology and content is simply missing in the curriculum. Others only have sprinklings of legal knowledge in the curriculum. Digital technology and content is fundamentally changing the way people in Africa access and consume information. The fundamental question is how prepared are librarians for the ever-changing digital rights associated with digital technology and content? In this paper digital rights refer to the application of traditional human rights to digital technology or digital environments. Second, are LIS programmes in Africa preparing professionals that are capable of navigating the difficult terrain of digital rights as well as engaging in legal and policy discourse on digital rights that affect LIS institutions? The paper is the first step in understanding what is taught by LIS programmes in Africa based on the analysis of course titles and descriptions from 11 programmes. Courses reviewed generally touched on some of the legal and technological issues associated with digital content. However, several of the contemporary issues associated with digital content and rights are missing from the courses and curriculum.</jats:p	['SDG04']

Design/methodology/approach This study used action research and employed three different data collection techniques: observations, semi-structured interviews and content analysis of classroom artifacts.   Findings The paper concluded that one-shot information literacy instruction was not sufficient for international ESL students to acquire information literacy. Findings suggested that lack of secondary information literacy instruction just prior to the final papers, and lack of one-on-one mentoring opportunities hindered effective information literacy acquisition for the selected cohort of ESL students.   Research limitations/implications Results derived from this study were used to design more effective, useful and holistic information literacy instruction for international ESL students beginning next semester at this private NY College.   Originality/value This is a case study where the paper has used the participatory action research to present the importance of collaboration between the classroom teacher and the librarian to improve ESL students’ information literacy experience. </jats:sec	['SDG04']

Attention was paid to health literacy, inhaler technique, respiratory conditioning and nutrition.ResultsHealth literacy was poor and most patients were not using their inhalers correctly. Five of 12 patients found exercising challenging and withdrew from the study early. In the remaining seven patients, statistically significant improvements in FEV1%, and quality of life scores were seen at three months. Improvements in exercise tolerance and BODE prognostic index did not reach statistical significance.ConclusionA home-based multidisciplinary student team can improve the functional status and the quality of life in patients living with COPD in a low-income setting. This approach offers a suitable model for community-based service learning.</jats:sec	['SDG04']

The survey response rate was 55% with 6310 parents and carers of eligible households participating. In addition, 2967 (89%) of young people aged 11-17 completed a self-report questionnaire with 2653 of the 12- to 17-year-olds completing questions about self-harm behaviour.In any 12-month period, about 8% of all 12- to 17-year-olds (an estimated 137,000 12- to 17-year-olds) report engaging in self-harming behaviour without suicide intent. This prevalence increases with age to 11.6% in 16- to 17-year-olds. Eighteen percent (18.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [14.5, 23.0]) of all 12- to 17-year-old young people with any mental health disorder measured by parent or carer report said that they had engaged in self-harm in the past 12 months. Among young people who were measured by self-report and met criteria for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' major depressive disorder almost half (46.6%; 95% CI = [40.0, 53.1]) also reported that they had engaged in self-harm in the past 12 months. Suicide risk among those who self-harm is significantly elevated relative to the general population.The demonstrated higher risks in these young people for continued harm or possible death support the need for ongoing initiatives to reduce self-harm through mental health promotion, improved mental health literacy and continuing mental health reform to ensure services are accessible to, and meet the needs of families and young persons.Stephen R Zubrick, Jennifer Hafekost, Sarah E Johnson, David Lawrence, Suzy Saw, Michael Sawyer, John Ainley, William J Buckingha	['SDG04']

It traces their interpretation of political ecology within local realities, based on household concerns centred upon water and food security, and how they came to draw upon global discourse and increased civic participation. The article shows how they created communities of practice that came to define local (and glocal1) sustainability. Their proactive and generative approaches to environmentalism – expressed through actions and institutions – are significant, offering examples of expanded social equity and adaptive resilience in the face of change.1Glocal is the connectivity and co-presence of local and global people, ideas and institutions.</jats:p	['SDG04']

Some evidence from Soviet films of the 1930s–1970s	International audienceIn the Soviet Union, the development of electrical communication technologies was a concomitant of literacy acquisition. In this context, some technical devices, such as telephone, appeared to remain bound to the urban context of communication: for most of the Soviet time, telephone was mainly used in cities by literate subscribers. Under these circumstances telephone was destined to fluctuate between primary and secondary orality. To verify this hypothesis, I am analysing scenes from the Soviet films shot between 1930 and 1970 where phone conversations have been deliberately put at the forefront. Examining oral expressions used by protagonists during their conversations I try to answer the following questions: Since when was telephone filmed as a medium of secondary orality? What obstacles had prevented it from exemplifying secondary orality in Walter Ong’s terms? What social and cultural aspects of Soviet reality are highlighted in the scenes in which Soviet telephone occupies a centre stage	['SDG04']

10.4102/sajip.v42i1.1283	Personal growth initiative among industrial psychology students in a higher education institution in South Africa	Orientation: Personal growth initiative (PGI) is an important characteristic of workplace counsellors. Industrial and organisational (I-O) psychologists often assist employees with counselling for work-related and personal problems, and therefore PGI is an important research topic for this profession.  Research purpose: The purpose of this study was to measure the PGI of I-O psychology students in a higher education institution in South Africa, as well as to explore differences in PGI between demographic groups.  Motivation: According to the scope of practice for psychologists, growth and development of employees form part of an I-O psychologist’s responsibilities. PGI is an important characteristic of I-O psychologists as it enables them to efficiently assist employees in growth and development processes.  Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey design was used. A purposive non-probability sample (N = 568) of I-O psychology students was taken from a higher education institution in South Africa. A biographical questionnaire and the personal growth initiative scale (PGIS) were used as measuring instruments.  Main findings: The results indicated that (1) the PGIS is a valid and reliable measure of PGI, (2) PGI is prevalent amongst I-O psychology students and (3) PGI differs between certain demographic groups.  Practical implications: The findings of this study will assist in the future development of a training programme for I-O psychology students to equip them with the counselling skills they need to function in a counselling role.  Contribution: This study contributes to knowledge regarding the importance of PGI for I-O psychology students. The study will also assist higher education institutes to adapt their training programmes in order to prepare I-O psychology students for their role as counsellors. More knowledge will also be provided with regard to the functioning of the PGIS	['SDG04']

Out-of-home placements were tracked across Grades 7 to 9 in a population of 58,000 youth. This included 10,911 students identified for special education (7,028 with learning disabilities, 1,247 with serious emotional disturbance, 1,245 with intellectual disabilities, 804 with speech and language impairments, and 587 with other disabilities). Students who received special education were twice as likely to experience out-of-home placements. The rates and types of out-of-home placements were differentially related to specific special education classifications. In particular, youth with serious emotional disturbance were more likely to experience out-of-home placements and to be involved in multiple sectors. Findings are discussed in relation to the development of intensive emotional and behavioral interventions for early adolescents who receive special education services. </jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1093/elt/ccw030	An academic literacies argument for decentralizing EAP provision	English-medium universities have generally adopted centralized models of in-sessional English language provision, where expertise resides and is often delivered within language development units or as part of larger cognate departments, typically TESOL or Applied Linguistics departments. This arrangement might be seen as reflecting a one-size-fits-all study skills perspective on EAP, one that treats the development of student writing, in particular, as mastery of a set of skills that are generalizable across different disciplines. With the emergence of the ‘academic literacies’ perspective, this emphasis has shifted somewhat towards an approach that gives greater recognition to the variation which exists between the writing practices of different academic disciplines. This shift provides support for a move away from a centralized model of English language provision to a decentralized approach that brings with it a number of distinct benefits outlined in this article	['SDG04']

Research aimed at addressing various aspects of floods, on the other hand, often follows paths that do not directly address all of these fundamental connections. With this in mind, the NSF-sponsored Studies of Precipitation, Flooding, and Rainfall Extremes Across Disciplines (SPREAD) workshop was organized and held in Colorado during the summers of 2013 and 2014. SPREAD brought together a group of 27 graduate students from a wide variety of academic disciplines, but with the unifying theme being research interests in extreme precipitation or flooding. During the first meeting of the workshop, groups of graduate student participants designed interdisciplinary research projects that they then began work on over the intervening year, with the second meeting providing a venue to present their results. This article will outline the preliminary findings of these research efforts. Furthermore, the workshop participants had the unique and meaningful experience of visiting several locations in Colorado that had flooded in the past, and then visiting them again in the aftermath of the devastating 2013 floods. In total, the workshop resulted in several fruitful research activities that will advance understanding of precipitation and flooding. Even more importantly, the workshop fostered the development of a network of early-career researchers and practitioners who will be “multilingual” in terms of scientific disciplines, and who are poised to lead within their respective careers and across the scientific community.</jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1111/lsi.12267	The “Right Paper”: Developing Legal Literacy in a Legal Self-Help Clinic	Legal self-help is the fastest-growing segment of legal services in the United States, and a significant addition to the repertoire of programs aimed at opening up access to justice in the civil legal system. Few studies, however, have examined how such services work in practice. Through ethnographic research and analysis of meetings between unrepresented litigants and attorneys offering advice in a legal self-help clinic, this article expands the empirical investigation of access to justice to consider what legal self-help looks like in actual practice. In this article, I follow the concept of the “right paper” to analyze the process through which legal self-help litigants develop legal literacy, including the role of lawyers in helping them to do so. The article concludes by discussing what such practices reveal about recent efforts to open up access to justice and also about the dynamics through which people come to think about law and, especially, how to use it.</jats:p	['SDG04']

We address this question for the children of the Roma—the largest and most disadvantaged minority group in Europe. To tackle the issue of non-random selection into preschool, we exploit variation in the individual distance to the nearest preschool facility. Non-parametric instrumental variable estimations reveal significant short-term gains in terms of children's literacy. Preschool attendance also increases the prevalence of vaccinations but has no effect on other observed health outcomes. Overall, preschool also does not seem to enhance integration measured by children's language proficiency or social–emotional development, at least not in the short term.</jats:p	['SDG04']

It ascertains the environmental attitudes and opinions of the residents and investigates their behavioral responses to waste management initiatives. Practical implications for enhancing sustainable waste management are discussed in this paper.   Design/methodology/approach Demonstration projects on waste segregation and recycling, as well as waste a reduction campaign, were set up on the campus to ascertain people’s attitudes and investigate their behavioral responses toward 3R practices. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey, observations, interviews and the project’s document review. A waste audit and waste composition analysis was carried out to assess waste flows and actual waste management behaviors and measure the change in the recycling rate.   Findings 3R waste management initiatives had positive effects on people’s attitudes about resources, waste management and consciousness of the need to avoid waste, but these initiatives did not affect recycling and waste management behavior. A voluntary approach-only cannot bring about behavioral change. Incentive measures showed a greater positive effect on waste reduction to landfills. Nevertheless, the demonstration projects helped to increase the overall campus recycling from 10 to 12 per cent.   Originality/value This paper addresses a literature gap about the 3R attitudes and resulting behavior as part of campus sustainability of higher education institutions in a developing country. The authors’ results revealed hurdles to be overcome and presents results that can be compared to behavioral responses of people from other developed countries. These findings can be used as a guide for higher education institution’s policy-makers, as they indicate that voluntary instruments alone will not yield effective results, and other mechanisms that have an impact on people's behavior are required. </jats:sec	['SDG04']

We examined the links between manual performance, degree of laterality (absolute difference between the two hands) and literacy in a group of 73 pupils with typical development observed at the end of kindergarten and in the middle of Grade 1. Phonological awareness and hand skill were assessed in kindergarten. Reading comprehension, reading, spelling and graphomotor skills were assessed in Grade 1. Phonological awareness was confirmed to be a strong predictor for reading and spelling. Higher performance levels in reading and spelling were found to be associated with a weaker degree of laterality and with faster peg-moving by the non-dominant hand. These results support the hypothesis that manual motor skills have an impact on spelling and reading acquisition	['SDG04']

Required actions include increased teaching of intercultural competencies and incorporation of indigenous ways of knowing and learning. Intercultural Communication as a discipline has primarily been developed from euro-centric traditions based in three domains of learning referred to as Bloom's taxonomy. Scholars and practitioners have increasingly identified problems in the way that intercultural competency is taught. The decolonization of education is implicated in finding solutions to those problems. Indigenization of education is one such effort. This chapter posits the Medicine Wheel, a teaching/learning framework that has widespread use in indigenous communities, for use in instructing intercultural communication. Bloom's taxonomy of the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains, is missing the fourth quadrant of the Medicine Wheel, spiritual. Examples of the spiritual quadrant are offered.</jats:p	['SDG04']

While the pedagogical design of the ﬁrst MOOCs grew out of the Open Education Movement, the current trend has MOOCs exhibiting fewer of the original openness goals than anticipated. The aim of this study is to examine the practices and attitudes of MOOC educators at an African university and ask whether and how their practices and attitudes become open after creating and teaching a MOOC. Activity Theory is used to contextually locate the educators’ motivations and to analyse their practices in terms of striving towards an object. With this lens we describe how educators’ openness-related practices and attitudes change over time in two different MOOCs. Two sets of conceptions of open practices are used to detect instances of change, providing four dimensions of changed open educational practices. Semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and artefacts provide data for this rare study, which considers these issues from the perspective of the Global South. Through studying the educators’ practices in relation to openness, it becomes evident how open practices are emergent and responsive	['SDG04']

The authors also explore how diverse immigrant populations integrate and conceptualize their education as a key route to personal meaning and future productivity. In highlighting the relationships between education, literacy and identity within a sociocultural context, this book is at the cutting edge of discussions about what matters as children learn.</jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1108/ejtd-08-2016-0066	The effect of soft skills and training methodology on employee performance	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of soft skill acquisition and the training methodology adopted on employee work performance. In this study, the authors study the trends of research in training and work performance in organisations that focus on the acquisition of technical or “hard skills” for employee training and evaluating work performance. This study was conducted to redirect the focus of employee training and development goals to the acquisition of soft skills, which have a very high and lasting impact on improving employee performance.   Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a quantitative research approach. Questionnaires were administered to selected managers and executives of a few Malaysian private companies. The questionnaire was specifically designed to examine the competencies of various Malaysian-based company managers, executives and supervisors who had undergone a soft skills training programme over a period of a few weeks or months. These soft skills training programmes were not conducted consecutively, but rather with a break or “time-space” in between each session. The target population in this study consisted of 810 employees from nine companies. The sample size was 260 trainees who were selected from the population with a 95 per cent confidence level within 0.05 risk of sampling error.   Findings Using regression analysis, this study estimated the relationships between employees’ acquisition of soft skills, the training methodology adopted by the trainer, and work performance. The results indicate that the two predictors – soft skill acquisition and training methodology – significantly predict employee performance. The authors propose the need for employers to redesign the methodology for training employees in soft skills. Based on the findings, “time-spaced learning” is highly potent in undermining the hindrance associated with training transfer.   Practical implications The findings of this study help to raise the awareness of employers, human resource managers, professional and industrial experts and the government to rethink the need to improve soft skills training methodologies. Specifically, this can be achieved by giving the trainees “space” or breaks to practice, apply and internalise what they have learnt intermittently during the training programme. This will enhance employee performance, and consequently, organisational performance. These findings also inform company managers that the time-spaced learning method enables employees to acquire soft skills more effectively, which will invariably bring about positive behaviour changes in employees towards their work and co-workers.   Originality/value The originality of this research is based on the fact that the results are peculiar to Malaysia, whereas most of the literatures on training methodology especially the time-space and soft skill have focused on developed countries. Furthermore, the study emphasised that time-space learning training methodology helps employees in transferring knowledge acquired during training to their work. The research also emphasised that soft skills acquisition brings about increase in employee work performance. This research shows 14.5 per cent increased employee work performance in the selected companies because of their employees’ acquisition of soft skills and a 27.9 per cent increase in employee performance is based on time-space training methodology. This makes the investigation on the effects of soft skills acquisition and the training methodology adopted on employee performance very important for organisational survival. </jats:sec	['SDG04']

The research found Bibliodidactics significantly improves the levels of technical reading among nonnative illiterate and poor-reading prisoners of Hebrew. The method is also significantly more efficient for nonnative illiterate prisoners, both in reading comprehension and in technical reading.

The book offers insight in participatory youth cultures through the theoretical lens of media reform. It provides a critical look at remix as a core component of civic agency and engagement. The book connects the act of popular political remix to cultural appropriation, subversion, and civic engagement, using historical and ethnographic research, along with textual analyses of various remixes. It uses the frame of monitorial citizenship to explore the role of citizen science in helping to tell stories of public importance. The book details the ways in which citizens learn to gather data, share it with their communities, and promote scientific learning and public data simultaneously. It looks at the case of political elections and youth-led online protests in Mexico in 2012 to argue for the potential of digital civic space in weak democracies	['SDG04']

This study proposes a framework to assist in the design and organisation of future Arab book fairs.   Design/methodology/approach The study used a variety of methods to obtain data, including questionnaires, site visits (both regional and international), observations and interviews. A literature review was also undertaken which helped determine major worldwide issues related to aspects of book fairs and the publishing industry, focusing on Arab book fairs.   Findings Arab international book fairs remain relatively traditional, however, there are several examples of innovative improvements in some states. Reading habits and literacy trends were found to be influenced by dominant socio-cultural factors, emphasising religion and children’s literature. This seems to have a reverse effect on the publishing industry. Results also revealed a number of disadvantages related to economic downturns and political instability. Despite continuous expansion, Arab book fairs still suffer from various obstacles which affect the publishing industry’s growth. There are other obstacles that they face which are directly associated with distribution and marketing as well as violations of intellectual property laws.   Practical implications This study proposes a framework for future improvement of the Muscat Book Fair. It discusses the engagement of local cultural institutions, non-profit community and academic organisations, as well as private sector organisations. These will leverage value and help keep abreast of international developments in book fairs/publishing. It is hoped that the proposed framework will be beneficial to those running book fairs at a regional level, and to countries with developing economies.   Originality/value There have been no previous empirical studies investigating book fairs in the Arab states. This study adds to the currently scarce body of literature related to book fairs and the publishing industry. </jats:sec	['SDG04']

Thus, researchers in the fields of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and second language acquisition (SLA) would profit from considering multilingualism and social justice when envisioning new CALL-SLA interfaces for the future. I first explain the connection I see among multilingualism, digital literacy, and social justice, and I characterize contemporary SLA as transformed by a social turn that is now complete, a bilingual turn slowly underway, and a social justice turn emerging on the horizon. I then review empirical evidence that suggests digital communication encourages multilingual practices, helps users appreciate the open nature of language resources, and perhaps even supports positive multilingual ideologies. Next, I offer some illustrations of possible new research questions and CALL-SLA studies that would focus on embracing and exploiting the openness of language resources in language learning, and on doing multilingual learning. Finally, I examine what we know about the digital divide that is relevant to CALL-SLA researchers. I close with a checklist for researchers interested in contributing to these new research interfaces in support of equitable multilingualism in online and offline language learning and teaching.</jats:p	['SDG04']

More specifically, the study reports an empirical investigation into the evolving activity of a 6.5-year-old child and an adult conversing about the child's drawing of 'Numberland'. What the child's drawing and his discussion about it with the adult tell us about his emergent mathematics skills is analysed. How the child shifts between speaking and enacting as if and as is, and how the adult supports his mathematics understanding through entering into the play-frame are analysed. How imaginary, play-based activities like this can provide the means for ECE and what this implies for the teacher are discussed	['SDG04']

10.18438/b8qs9m	What is the best way to develop information literacy and academic skills of first year health science students? A systematic review	Abstract&#x0D; &#x0D; Objective – This systematic review sought to identify evidence for best practice to support the development of information literacy and academic skills of first year undergraduate health science students.&#x0D; &#x0D; Methods – A range of electronic databases were searched and hand searches conducted. Initial results were screened using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify 53 relevant articles. Data on study design, student cohort, support strategy, and learning outcomes were extracted from each article. Quality of individual studies was considered and described narratively. Articles were classified and findings synthesized according to the mode of delivery of the intervention (Embedded, Integrated, or Adjunct) and classification of the study’s learning evaluation outcome (Organizational change, Behaviour, Learning, or Reaction). &#x0D; &#x0D; Results – Studies included in this review provide information on academic skills and information literacy support strategies offered to over 12,000 first year health science students. Courses targeted were varied but most commonly involved nursing, followed by psychology. Embedded strategies were adopted in 21 studies with Integrated and Adjunct strategies covered in 14 and 16 studies respectively. Across all modes of delivery, intervention formats included face-to-face, peer mentoring, online, and print based approaches, either solely or in combination. Most studies provided some outcomes at a level higher than student reaction to the intervention. Overall, irrespective of mode of delivery, positive learning outcomes were generally reported. Typically, findings of individual studies were confounded by the absence of suitable control groups, students self-selecting support and analysis of outcomes not accounting for these issues. As a result, there is very little unbiased, evaluative evidence for the best approach to supporting students. Nonetheless, our findings did identify poor student uptake of strategies when they are not interwoven into the curriculum, even when students were encouraged to attend on the basis that they had been identified at academic risk.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusions – The majority of studies included have reported positive learning outcomes following the implementation of academic skills and information literacy support strategies, irrespective of their mode of delivery (Embedded, Integrated, or Adjunct). Clear, rigorous evidence that embedded strategies offer superior learning outcomes compared to other delivery modes is lacking. However, because of poor student uptake of strategies offered outside curricula, embedded modes of academic and information literacy support are recommended for first year health science courses.</jats:p	['SDG04']
10.1007/s11121-017-0840-y	A Pre-Post Evaluation of OpenMinds: a Sustainable, Peer-Led Mental Health Literacy Programme in Universities and Secondary Schools	Engaging young people in the design and delivery of mental health education could lead to more effective interventions; however, few of these interventions have been evaluated. This study aimed to gain preliminary evidence with regards to the efficacy and acceptability of OpenMinds: a peer-designed and facilitated mental health literacy programme for university and secondary school students. The programme involves a structured programme of education and training for university medical students, who then deliver workshops in secondary schools. Pre- and post-surveys were completed by 234 school students who received two workshops and 40 university medical students who completed the OpenMinds programme and delivered the workshops. The main outcomes in both groups were components of mental health literacy (non-stigmatising attitudes, knowledge, social distance and helping attitudes). Perceived teaching efficacy and interest in mental health careers (university medical students) and workshop acceptability (school students) were also examined. University and school student participation in OpenMinds was associated with significant improvements in three of four mental health literacy elements in both samples. Knowledge and attitudes improved in both samples, social distance improved only in the university sample and knowledge of helping behaviours increased in the school sample. University students' perceived teaching efficacy improved but there was no change in their reported interest in pursuing psychiatry in their career. Acceptability was high; over 70% of the school students agreed that they enjoyed the workshops and liked being taught by a university student. This study provides preliminary evidence for the acceptability and efficacy of OpenMinds as a sustainable peer-led model of mental health education for young people. The OpenMinds programme is ready for efficacy testing in a randomised trial	['SDG04']
10.4102/hts.v73i3.4545	Christian ministry and theological education as instruments for economic survival in Africa	There is a conflict over whether Christian ministry and theological education should be pursued with an expectation for economic survival. The rise of Christian ministry practice emphasising wealth and prosperity has heightened commodification of the Christian ministry. Church ministry and theological education are being used as instruments for economic profit. The link between theological education and Christian ministry, among other things, is that church practices and ministry expressions reflect the underlying theology. In such a situation, this article reflects on the following questions: How are Christian ministry and its undergirding theology being utilised as instruments of economic prosperity in Africa? What is the theological education approach that is employed to support this ministry approach? The article attempts to establish an understanding of ministerial practise that has biblically and theologically informed views of material wealth. It begins by examining the traditional missionary model of ministry as a sacrificial act and responses by African clergy. This is followed by examination of the development of the view of ministry as a means of economic survival and commodification of ministry and theological education in Africa. It concludes by providing an evaluation and proposing a way forward	['SDG04']

However, these factors have not been assessed among Moroccan adolescents. This study aimed to determine prevalence of PI and SB and to explore their potential social-ecological associated factors in school-age adolescents. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 764 students (age range, 14–19 years) were enrolled from six schools in Taza city, Morocco. The Global School-based Student Health Survey was used to collect data about variables. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess relations between dependent and independent variables. Results Overall, the prevalence of PI was 79.5% and SB was 36.5%. Among girls, these rates were higher (87.0 and 39.1%, respectively) than rates shown in boys (70.9 and 33.6%, respectively). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, PI was associated with the following variables: illiterate father, hunger, suicidal ideation, inadequate vegetable consumption, and absence from physical education classes. Age, inadequate vegetable consumption, and absenteeism were associated with SB. Conclusions The prevalence of PI and SB is high, especially among girls. Thus, there is an urgent need to implement appropriate interventions to reduce PI and SB levels in secondary school-age adolescents and the associated factors identified can be useful	['SDG04']

Internet-based information on advance directives was selected because, if it is inaccurate or difficult to understand, patients risk making decisions about their care that may not be followed in practice. Method: Two validated health information evaluation tools, the Suitability Assessment of Materials and DISCERN, and a focus group were used to assess credibility, user orientation and effectiveness. Findings: Only one of the 34 internet-based information items on advance directives reviewed fulfilled the study criteria and 30% of the sites were classed as unreadable. In terms of learning and informing, 79% of the sites were considered unsuitable. Conclusion: Using health literacy tools to evaluate internet-based health information highlights that often it is not at a functional literacy level and neither informs nor empowers users to make independent and valid healthcare decisions	['SDG04']
10.1177/0004944117732637	Indigenous children’s affective engagement with school: The influence of socio-structural, subjective and relational factors	In this study, Indigenous children's affective engagement with primary school is examined in terms of feelings of involvement and belonging at school and towards education as a worthwhile pursuit. Previous Australian research has concentrated on Indigenous children's education through attendance and school performance. Data from wave 6 of the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children are used to investigate the socio-structural, subjective and relational factors which influence affective engagement with school. Results show that good relationships with peers and teachers are positively associated with Indigenous children's affective engagement. Negative feelings about Indigenous identity are negatively associated with affective engagement. Socio-structural factors associated with higher affective engagement include being female, living in remote areas and being healthier. Results also show that parental education, employment, household income or area-level socio-economic circumstances are not associated with affective engagement. These results suggest that factors influencing Indigenous children's affective engagement with school and towards education may differ from those affecting school attendance. They also emphasise the importance of subjective and relational influences on improving Indigenous children's education outcomes	['SDG04']

10.17159/2224-7912/2017/v57n4a11	Professional development of Afrikaans Home Language teachers to enhance reading comprehension of non-mother-tongue speakers	Hierdie studie ondersoek die professionele ontwikkelingsbehoeftes van onderwysers met betrekking tot die bevordering van die leesbegrip van niemoedertaalsprekers in Afrikaans-huistaalklasse. Gebaseer op die data wat gegenereer is, is 'n professionele ontwikkelingsprogram ontwerp en geїmplementeer. Onderwysers het aangedui dat hulle oorweldig en gefrustreerd voel, omdat hulle nie oor die nodige kennis beskik om die niemoedertaalsprekers in hulle klasse in die Intermediêre fase te ondersteun nie en het behoefte gehad aan professionele ontwikkeling sodat hulle pedagogiese inhoudskennis in dié verband uitgebrei kan word. Hierdie studie het 'n gemengde navorsingsbenadering gevolg. Empiriese data is gegenereer op die volgende wyses: kwantitatiewe (vraelyste) en kwalitatiewe data (vraelyste, onderwysersjoernale, klaskamerwaarnemings en onderhoude met onderwysers). Aangesien hierdie studie die professionele ontwikkeling van onderwysers behels, is 'n teoretiese raamwerk, wat hulle voortgesette professionele ontwikkeling en groei in ag neem, oorweeg soos beskryf deur Shulman (1986) se teoretiese raamwerk. Gesprekke voor die aanvang van die studie dui daarop dat die meerderheid respondente geen professionele ontwikkeling ondergaan het aangaande die bevordering van lees- en leesbegripstrategieë van niemoedertaalsprekers in hulle Afrikaans Huistaal-klasse nie en die meerderheid respondente het aangedui dat hulle nie leesbegripstrategieë eksplisiet onderrig nie. Bevindinge van die studie dui daarop dat die professioneleontwikkelingsprogram 'n positiewe invloed op die pedagogiese inhoudskennis van die deelnemende onderwysers rakende leesmodelle en -strategieë sowel as leesbegripstrategieë gehad het. Eweneens het die professioneleontwikkelingsprogram gelei tot die verhoogde implementering van leesbegripstrategieë in hulle klasse. Voorts dui die resultate daarop dat aksienavorsing moontlik 'n bydrae kon lewer tot die effektiewe toepassing van lees- en leesbegripstrategieë in hulle klasse.

10.1071/ah17049	Key lessons for designing health literacy professional development courses	Health literacy courses for health professionals have emerged in response to health professionals’ perceived lack of understanding of health literacy issues, and their failure to routinely adopt health literacy practices. Since 2013 in Victoria, Australia, the Centre for Culture, Ethnicity and Health has delivered an annual health literacy demonstration training course that it developed. Course development and delivery partners included HealthWest Partnership and cohealth. The courses are designed to develop the health literacy knowledge, skills and organisational capacity of the health and community services sector in the western metropolitan region of Melbourne. This study presents key learnings from evaluation data from three health literacy courses using Wenger’s professional educational learning design framework. The framework has three educational learning architecture components (engagement, imagination and alignment) and four educational learning architecture dimensions (participation, emergent, local/global, identification). Participatory realist evaluation approaches and qualitative methods were used. The evaluations revealed that the health literacy courses are developing leadership in health literacy, building partnerships among course participants, developing health literacy workforce knowledge and skills, developing ways to use and apply health literacy resources and are serving as a catalyst for building organisational infrastructure. Although the courses were not explicitly developed or implemented using Wenger’s educational learning design pedagogic features, the course structure (i.e. facilitation role of course coordinators, providing safe learning environments, encouraging small group work amongst participants, requiring participants to conduct mini-projects and sponsor organisation buy-in) provided opportunities for engagement, imagination and alignment. Wenger’s educational learning design framework can inform the design of future key pedagogic features of health literacy courses.  What is known about the topic? Health professionals are increasingly participating in health literacy professional development courses.  What does this paper add? This paper provides key lessons for designing health literacy professional development courses by reflecting upon Wenger’s professional educational learning design framework.  What are the implications for practitioners? To ensure health professionals are receiving evidence-informed health literacy professional education, we encourage future health literacy courses be designed, implemented and evaluated using existing professional educational learning design frameworks.  </jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1177/0081246317701887	Student accounts of space and safety at a South African university: implications for social identities and diversity	Transformation efforts in South African higher education have been under increased scrutiny in recent years, especially following the last years of student activism and calls for decolonization of universities. This article presents data from a participatory photovoice study in which a group of students reflect on their experiences of feeling safe and unsafe at an urban-based historically disadvantaged university. Findings highlight the way in which historical inequalities on the basis of social identities of race, class, and gender, among others, continue to shape experiences, both materially and social-psychologically, in South African higher education. However, and of particular relevance in thinking about a socially just university, participants speak about the value of diversity in facilitating their sense of both material and subjective safety. Thus, a diverse classroom and one that acknowledges and recognizes students across diversities, is experienced as a space of comfort, belonging and safety. Drawing on feminist work on social justice, we argue the importance of lecturer sensitivity and reflexivity to their own practices, as well as the value of social justice pedagogies that not only focus on issues of diversity and equality but also destabilize dominant forms of didactic pedagogy, and engage students’ diverse experiences and perceptions. </jats:p	['SDG04']

For example, Korea has been using computers and Internet into primary and secondary schools since the 1980s. There have been many educational policies for ICT use in education. Not only developed countries but also developing countries make a lot of effort to enhance the quality of education by using ICT in education. First of all, ICT competence of teachers is very important in order that ICT can be an effective tool in education. The level of teachers’ ICT competence decides the level of using ICT in education. However, it is not easy for many teachers to take training for enhancing the level of ICT competence in a short time. This study suggests an e-learning system for strengthening the ICT competence of teachers by using an example of an educational environment in Nicaragua. Since this e-learning system can be operated by using cloud computing technology, it will provide implications for education projects with ICT use in primary and secondary schools in developing countrie	['SDG04']

In line with prior early childhood research, parent language acculturation was operationalized as fathers’ and mothers’ English proficiency and primary language used in the home. Parenting was operationalized as fathers’ and mothers’ participation in home learning stimulation (e.g. shared book reading). Analyses showed that, after controlling for demographics, fathers’ and mothers’ primary language in the home predicted children’s reading achievement and fathers’ and mothers’ English proficiency predicted children’s math achievement. Furthermore, maternal home learning stimulation made a unique contribution to children’s reading achievement after the influence of parent language acculturation was accounted for, underscoring the importance of home learning stimulation for strengthening Mexican American children’s reading skills prior to school entry.</jats:p	['SDG04']

10.19108/koers.82.3.2327	A critical analysis of the learners' constitutional rights to basic education in South African public schools	Globally, several countries have been proposing to make primary education compulsory and freely available to all. Although there has been steady growth in learner enrolment in South African public schools since 1994, the socio-economic status of parents, racial and religious discrimination, high cost of school fees and schools’ language policies have prevented poor learners from accessing basic education, especially in public schools located within affluent areas. This paper critically examines legislation and policies relating to children’s constitutional rights to basic education. The government’s mandate to redress past injustices and concentrate on social justice and equity in public education is hampered by the failure of many schools tocorrectly interpret or consistently apply legislation and regulations relating to learner admissions. It has been found that the admission policies drawn up by school governing bodies (SGB) covertly prevent poor learners from enrolling at affluent schools. Although school admissions have been contested in various court cases, governing bodies of some affluent public schools continue to practise unfairness in opening its doors to all children. To ensure that social justice and equity prevail in school education, the Department of Education should revise policies or amend existing legislation encouraging SGBs to provide learner access without any prejudice.</jats:p	['SDG04']

10.15359/ree.21-1.15	Influence of audio-musical activities on literacy of five years old children	El periodo de la educación infantil es la base para el desarrollo integral de la niñez. En esta etapa el personal docente debe reforzar los conocimientos de los alumnos y las alumnas, ya que todo lo que se trabaja repercutirá a lo largo de su vida. Por otra parte, la música constituye un recurso de primer orden en estas etapas educativas iniciales, por su valor formativo e influencia en los distintos ámbitos del desarrollo del ser humano. En este sentido, el trabajo que se presenta tiene por objetivo conocer si las actividades sonoras-auditvas-musicales influyen favorablemente en el desarrollo de la lecto-escritura en la niñez de cinco años. Para ello, se ha seguido una metodología mixta cualitativa-cuantitativa y de triangulación, tomando el análisis de contenido vertido en la bibliografía relacionada con el tema de la investigación, y, posteriormente, con la técnica del diseño experimental (pretest-experimento-postest), con dos clases (experimental y clase control), se enmarca dentro del paradigma de la investigación-acción. A la vista de los resultados, se puede afirmar que las actividades audio-musicales influyen significativamente en la adquisición de la lecto-escritura sin grandes diferencias entre los niños y las niñas. Pre-school education period is the foundation for children development. Teachers must reinforce students’ knowledge in this stage since all the contents covered will impact throughout their lives. Due to its educational value and influence on the different aspects of children development, music should be regarded as an essential resource in these early learning stages. In this regard, this work aims to analyze if the activities including music, hearing, and sound have a positive influence on the unfolding of literacy skills on five-year-old children. To accomplish such objectives, qualitative, quantitative, and triangulation methodologies have been used by taking the content analysis from the literature review related to the topic of this investigation and then after, by using the experimental design technique (pre-test/experiment/post-test) with two design types (experimental and controlled class) from the research-action paradigm. Considering the results of this research, it can be asserted that audio-musical activities significantly influence reading and writing skills acquisition without noteworthy differences between boys and girls	['SDG04']

Western historians and philosophers of history have increasingly noted the changing relationship of people to the past and the emergence of a different historical consciousness. Studies of historical consciousness reveal the ubiquity of the past in contemporary culture and society. More than simply helping us to understand how people connect to history or how well they know it, such research also reveals history as fundamental to the way people perceive themselves. Historical consciousness is both intuitive and learned. The nexus between the past and the discipline of history raises several critical educational questions, such as: How can we operationalize historical consciousness? Can it be taught and in what ways? How does it function alongside historical thinking and reasoning in classroom engagement? This chapter canvasses and historicizes multiple definitions of historical consciousness as it relates to history education and explores some classroom applications	['SDG04']

10.1177/0022466918772300	Disproportionality in Special Education: A Synthesis of International Research and Trends	Access to schooling and special education services remains a challenge for many children with disabilities around the world. In the United States, much attention has focused on disproportionality—the over- and underrepresentation of student groups within special education. In this study, to contextualize and better understand the scope and factors associated with disproportionality in the United States and abroad, we synthesized literature on special education disproportionality in international contexts and identified trends across student groups and countries, including the ways in which scholars have examined this topic. Results show that studies focused mainly on the overrepresentation of ethnic minority, immigrant, and Indigenous populations in European or English-speaking nations. Nearly all studies emphasized structural inequalities in society over cultural barriers as mechanisms contributing to disproportionality. Policy recommendations, however, were more likely to focus on improving the special education identification process. The review has implications for research, practice, and policy to improve education for children with disabilities in the United States and abroad. </jats:p	['SDG04']
10.5860/crln.79.5.228	Critical digital pedagogy and cultural sensitivity in the library classroom: Infographics and digital storytelling	Academic librarians have a demonstrated interest in digital tools for teaching and learning and often provide support for these tools to their wider campus communities. Additionally, many librarians incorporate these tools into their own teaching in the information literacy classroom. However, little has been written about how digital tools can support critical information literacy and critical pedagogy specifically in library instruction. Eamon Tewell defines critical information literacy as instruction that asks “students to engage with and act upon the power structures underpinning information’s production and dissemination.”1 According to Paulo Freire, critical pedagogy acknowledges that education is a political action that can have an adverse effect on certain students.2 We define critical as self-reflexive and intentionally engaged with power structures.</jats:p	['SDG04']

Methods: The children’s and the parents’ versions of the Inventory of Life Quality in Children and Adolescents (ILC) were used to measure health-related quality of life (QOL) in 2140 school children (response rate 93%) and 1639 parents (response rate 71%) recruited from nine primary schools in Norway. A set of physical characteristics were also measured in the children: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, average daily minutes of physical activity, aerobic fitness, and handgrip strength. Results: The regression analysis showed stronger relationships between the covariates and QOL for the parents’ assessments than for the children’s. Parents’ level of education was significantly related to children’s QOL, with the strongest association for parental QOL assessment. Among the physical variables, aerobic fitness ( B = 0.01, p &gt; .001 in both samples), and handgrip strength in the parents’ sample ( B = 0.21, p &lt; .05) were significantly related to the children’s QOL. Conclusions: The present study replicated the well-known finding that parents’ sociodemographic status is important for children’s QOL. Our new contribution is to show that the physiological variables aerobic fitness and muscular strength also contributed significantly to explain variance in QOL. This opens up interesting perspectives on how to improve QOL among children through more emphasis on physical activity and physical fitness in schools. </jats:p	['SDG04']

Special educators’ change in perceptions of their efficacy as collaborators in the education of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was studied before and after completing a year-long federally funded graduate certificate program in autism. Self-perceptions of collaborative expertise were examined in eight cohorts of educators over 7 years. Analysis of the results indicated a significant increase in perceptions of efficacy level in six of the cohorts at ≤ .006. The size of the effect of the program on participants’ self-perceptions of their efficacy in working collaboratively with other school personnel was large for seven of the cohorts and medium for one. Most importantly, results from Greenhouse–Geisser analysis showed that the posttest scores on collaboration efficacy level were significantly higher than the pretest scores across all cohorts, and that the pattern of change in pretest to posttest scores was similar across all eight cohorts. </jats:p	['SDG04']

10.1186/s40594-017-0077-0	Adolescents as agents of healthful change through scientific literacy development: A school-university partnership program in New Zealand	BACKGROUND: Scientific literacy development is widely emphasized as the overarching goal of science education. It encompasses development of understanding of the nature of science as well as knowledge, attitudes, and values that contribute to empowering adolescents to engage with and make evidence-based decisions about socioscientific issues. Scientific literacy development is enhanced when learning is contextualized in exploration of socioscientific issues.Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) associated with a combination of obesity and adverse environmental exposures are examples of pressing health-related SSIs facing the world today. Evidence emerging from the field of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) has identified adolescence as a key life-phase where population-wide education-based interventions that empower teens to engage in science-based health-promoting behaviors could significantly change the course of this epidemic. To achieve this, learning resources that support scientific and health literacy development contextualized in issues linking NCD risk and DOHaD are required.The Healthy Start to Life Education for Adolescents Project is a school-university partnership program designed to support scientific and health literacy development, knowledge translation, and participant-led actions relating to NCD risk prevention. This study assesses the impact of program participation in a cohort of 11-14-year-olds in New Zealand. Evaluation comprised analysis of individually matched questionnaires, pre-, 3 months, and 12 months post-intervention (n = 201) and 6 months post-intervention interviews (n = 40). RESULTS: Positive engagement in science learning occurred. Positive changes in health-related awareness and attitudes 3 months post-intervention were sustained to 12 months. Adolescents reporting pre-intervention dietary behaviors associated with increased obesity risk reported sustained positive behavior changes (p < .001). Qualitative evidence revealed that these changes resulted from application of scientific and health literacy. This has the potential to improve long-term health outcomes for adolescents and their future offspring. Furthermore, feedback from parents demonstrated that adolescents became science communicators within their families. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that contextualized learning promoting scientific and health literacy development facilitated knowledge translation. This allowed adolescents to decide if, and how, to use scientific evidence in relation to their current and future wellbeing. Exploration of the transferability of scientific and health literacy capabilities, and impacts on future health would enhance understanding of the value of the intervention	['SDG04']

10.1075/jlac.00001.arc	A critical literacy proposal for exploring conflict and immigrant identities in the classroom: Or how not to sweep conflict under the multicultural classroom carpet	AbstractIn this paper we intend to show that conflict emerging from multiple and competing perspectives on social reality, may not necessarily be avoided in class, but it could instead become the starting point of critical discussions among teachers and students. To this end, we focus on the exploitation of essays written by immigrant students attending Greek Lyceums (15–18 years old) to promote conflict-dialogue processes in class, which are most compatible with critical literacy. We suggest that language teaching concentrating on texts including immigrant experiences and ambivalent identities constructed by immigrant students, could underline the conflict between majority expectations or pressures and minority efforts to adjust to a complex, often inhospitable context. Such a conflict could enhance immigrant and non-immigrant students’ critical literacy by bringing to the surface and critically discussing assimilationist and monoculturalist ideologies, thus promoting a culturally sustaining pedagogy.</jats:p	['SDG04']

Yet, scholarly research on eyewitness misidentification and memory distortion is virtually absent in scholarly work in journalism and related academic fields. This chapter emphasizes the need for such a research agenda by analyzing the amount of mistakes student journalists made in a news report they wrote during a 20-minute classroom exercise. Each of the stories about a staged bar fight, except for one, contained pieces of misinformation because the students often blindly trusted eyewitnesses and messages on social media accounts. The results indicated that there is a need for more advanced information and media literacy modules in journalism curricula to avoid inaccurate information from eyewitnesses to be disseminated to the public. </jats:p	['SDG04']

Cross-sectional study of the entire population resident in Catalonia in 2015 (7.5 million people) using administrative records. Twenty indicators are analysed related to health, the use of healthcare services and consumption of prescription drugs. Rates, frequencies and averages are obtained for the different variables stratified by age groups (under 15 years, 15-64 years and 65 years or older), gender and socioeconomic status (calculated on the basis of pharmacy copayment levels and Social Security benefits received). A socioeconomic gradient was observed in all the indicators analysed, in both sexes and in all age groups. Morbidity, use of mental healthcare centres, hospitalisation rates and probability of drug consumption among children is 3-7 times higher for those with low socioeconomic level respect to those with a higher one. In children and adults, the steepest gradient was found in the use of mental health services. Moreover, there are gender inequalities. There are significant socioeconomic inequalities in health status and in the use of healthcare services in the population of Catalonia. To respond to this situation, new policies on health and other areas, such as education and employment, are required, especially those that have an impact on early years	['SDG04']

Muchos docentes no parecen estar conscientes de cómo enseñan la escritura, si lo hacen como práctica del lenguaje o como práctica social. Por lo tanto, esta investigación buscó identificar la comprensión de los docentes acerca de enseñar a escribir en inglés en los cursos de Comunicación en el Programa de Inglés, así como los desafíos que podrían enfrentar al enseñarlo. Los datos se recopilaron de observaciones de clase, el diario del investigador, entrevistas con tres docentes del Programa de Enseñanza del Inglés en la Universidad de Córdoba, y fuentes secundarias como actividades de escritura y los programas del curso. Los resultados mostraron que los docentes tienen creencias sobre cómo enseñar la escritura, generalmente siguiendo un enfoque orientado al producto y al proceso. Sin embargo, los participantes descubrieron instancias en las que han enseñado a escribir como práctica social; aunque, no parecen estar completamente conscientes de las causas. Además, los maestros revelaron que enfrentan desafíos que hacen que la enseñanza de la escritura sea abrumadora y difícil. Se sugiere que se necesita más investigación para continuar explorando cómo los maestros pueden superar los desafíos que enfrentan y hacer uso de un enfoque más equilibrado que integre las formas textuales, centradas en el individuo pero también en lo social.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .........................................................................................IIIABSTRACT .......................................................................................................................IVCHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION.............................................................................. 1CHAPTER 2: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK............................................ 62.1.

The study also assessed the extent to which children’s economic disadvantagement status moderates the relationship between KRA-L scores and the level of participation in SPARK Ohio, an early education intervention focused on increasing parental engagement and advocacy. KRA-L scores for children entering kindergarten in fall 2012 were analyzed for 548 SPARK Ohio participants and 1594 comparison children. Both SPARK Ohio and comparison children identified as economically disadvantaged scored significantly lower on the KRA-L, compared to children not classified as economically disadvantaged. Economic disadvantage status may moderate the influence of participating in SPARK Ohio; children identified as economically disadvantaged scored significantly higher on the KRA-L when they participated in SPARK Ohio, compared to those that did not participate in SPARK Ohio	['SDG04']

10.1371/journal.pone.0207484	Touching beliefs: Using touchscreen technology to elicit subjective expectations in survey research	When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals may form subjective expectations about probabilities of events relevant for their choice. Accurate measurement of subjective expectations is critical for high-quality data needed to analyze individual behavior. This paper reports the development and validity of a new method of eliciting point subjective expectations in developing countries. We developed a touchscreen-based application that combines an animated slider along with dynamic images that change relative sizes based on the probability indicated by the respondent. We compare our method to the more traditional approach of using beans as visual aids. First, we find that respondents have a sound understanding of basic concepts of probability. Second, we test for equality of the distributions elicited with the different methods and find them highly comparable. Third, we provide evidence that respondents report a more favorable opinion about the slider method and more willingness to complete long surveys using the slider rather than beans. Our findings suggest that the slider could be a viable elicitation method for empirical researchers who aim to collect data on subjective expectations in developing countries	['SDG04']

To ensure Australian Indigenous families benefit from this 1000 days framework, an Indigenous-led year-long engagement process was undertaken linking early-life researchers, research institutions, policy-makers, professional associations and human rights activists with Australian Indigenous organisations and families. The resultant model, First 1000 Days Australia, broadened the international concept beyond improving nutrition. The First 1000 Days Australia model was built by adhering to Indigenous methodologies, a recognition of the centrality of culture that reinforces and strengthens families, and uses a holistic view of health and wellbeing. The First 1000 Days Australia was developed under the auspice of Indigenous people's leadership using a collective impact framework. As such, the model emphasises Indigenous leadership, mutual trust and solidarity to achieve early-life equity.</jats:p	['SDG04']

10.4018/978-1-5225-4035-9.ch007	Financing millennials in developing economies: Banking strategies for undergraduate students	Young millennials (i.e., 18 to 24 years old) are not a primary market for the traditional banking system, especially in emerging economies. Despite the fact that almost 30% of college students have partial jobs, economic resources are limited and access to finance seems utopic. Banking services throughout the world but especially in growing economies do not fully serve students because of their lack of resources. Whether to pay for college studies or clothing, dinner or a weekend vacation, young millennials do not expect to receive banking credit from the big bank brands. In fact, this market segment is served by the retail industry with their own credit programs and financial services. In this chapter, the authors explore how young millennials have access to savings and credit, their spending behavior, their attitudes towards traditional sources of finance, and their financial inclusion and literacy. They also conducted an empirical exploratory study among college students in Mexico to hear firsthand how they managed their finances. </jats:p	['SDG04']

In Bangladesh, traditional structures limit women's social interaction to their immediate family and maintain male responsibility over them. However, here we look at the example of Saptagram – a social mobilisation organisation particularly focused against gender injustice towards rural landless Bangladeshi women – and how by providing relationships beyond the private sphere it engendered bonds of friendship and loyalty amongst its beneficiaries. Difficulties with systems and its inability to recruit a new line of leadership led to its apparent failure at one point. Yet, despite this, by providing knowledge of rights, respect, courage to stand up for one's beliefs and a sense of wellbeing through working alongside people in the villages, it inspired an enduring solidarity amongst the women it served which led to its eventual resurrection	['SDG05']

10.1177/0191453712448000	Women's rights in Muslim societies: Lessons from the Moroccan experience	Major changes have taken place in Muslim societies in general during the last decades. Traditional family and social organizational structures have come into conflict with the perceptions and needs of development and modern state-building. Moreover, the international context of globalization, as well as changes in intercommunity relations through immigration, have also deeply affected social and cultural mutations by facilitating contact between different cultures and civilizations.  Of the dilemmas arising from these changes, those concerning women’s and men’s roles were the most conflictive issues because of different interpretations and evaluations of historical, religious and/or cultural heritages.  In the case of Morocco, for over 30 years, women’s and human rights NGOs have acted and advocated to promote women’s rights. The main disputes have concerned the distinction between what is within the requirements of Islam and what is the consequence of traditional social beliefs and practices. This ended nevertheless with the adoption by the Parliament of a new Family Law proclaimed in February 2004. This law was the result of a process of consultation and national debate, which made possible substantial progress in terms of proclaimed values of equality of rights between men and women, with the support of most national political and social leaders. Several lessons can be learned from the Moroccan experience. The crucial role of civil society, the political support of the state at its highest level, the working methodology of the Royal Advisory Commission and the final process for the adoption of the new code were from the most determinant parameters.  In light of recent developments in some majority-Muslim countries, the future of women’s rights is a key issue of the so-called Arab spring. Muslim women’s challenges and struggles are not only ideological and legal battles, but they are also social and political struggles for which one of the major conditions is to prevent and prohibit the use of Islam as a political instrument. Muslim societies need to educate people properly and change their traditional representations and patterns of thought. To promote justice, equity and equality in general, as well as to protect women’s economic rights, they need appropriate economic and social policies. Then women can really promote, protect and benefit from the advances of their legal status. </jats:p	['SDG05']

First, the key factor motivating citizens of the United Kingdom to seek medical treatment in India is identified and analyzed. Second, the life prospects of the majority of the citizens of the two nations are compared to determine whether the United Kingdom is morally warranted in relying on India to meet the medical needs of its citizens. Third, as neoliberal reforms are justified on the grounds that they will help the indigent populations affected by them, the impact of medical tourism—a neoliberal initiative—on India's socially and economically marginalized groups is scrutinized. </jats:p	['SDG05']

Available technologies have dramatically reduced mortality in high-income settings, yet cervical cancer receives considerably little attention on the global health policy landscape. The authors applied four policy-analysis frameworks to literature on global cervical cancer to explore the question of why cervical cancer may not be receiving the international attention it may otherwise warrant. Each framework explores the process of agenda setting and discerns factors that either facilitate or hinder policy change in cases where there is both a clear problem and a potential effective solution. In combination, these frameworks highlight a number of crucial elements that may be needed to raise the profile of cervical cancer on global health agendas, including improving local (national or sub-national) information on the condition; increasing mobilisation of affected civil society groups; framing cervical cancer debates in ways that build upon its classification as a non-communicable disease (NCD) and an issue of women's rights; linking cervical cancer screening to well-funded services such as those for HIV treatment in some countries; and identifying key global policy windows of opportunity to promote the cervical cancer agenda, including emerging NCD global health discussions and post-2015 reviews of the Millennium Development Goals	['SDG05']

Criminologists have failed to examine sexual violence as a group-level phenomenon, which is often exhibited during war. For this study, case study methodology was used to analyze court transcripts from the United Nations, detailing the conflict of Sierra Leone. By utilizing the framing perspective, the purpose of this study was to determine the nature of sexual violence during war, focusing specifically on whether the evolution of sex offending motivations changes overtime. A better understanding of how sex offending becomes a group behavior will expand the current literature on collective and sexual violence, identify preconflict indicators of collective sexual violence, and provide strategies for postconflict mediations in warring countries. </jats:p	['SDG05']
10.1080/00224499.2013.792327	Navigating ambivalence: How heterosexual young adults make sense of desire differences	The miscommunication hypothesis is the assumption that many incidents of acquaintance rape and coercive sex follow from miscommunication between men and women. This hypothesis is entrenched in popular, academic, and judicial understandings of sexual relationships. Recently some evidence has suggested that there is little miscommunication between sexual partners and that the hypothesis does not explain acquaintance rape or other forms of sexual violence. The present study used qualitative methodology in which men and women were asked to imagine themselves in a particular heterosexual dating situation and write what they think happened between the beginning (when sex was refused by one partner) and the end (when sex happened). Thematic analysis of the data found no evidence for miscommunication between partners under conditions of differences in desire. Instead, ambivalence about sexual activity was commonly described by women and men and was most often resolved to both parties satisfaction. Coercion by men was present in a minority of narratives under conditions of clear understanding of women\u27s refusals. The study thus provides a rich, experience-based representation of heterosexual sexual activity, with considerable potential for the development of effective education campaigns. © 2014 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality	['SDG05']

10.1016/j.ejfs.2011.04.001	Forensic nursing science: Global strategies in health and justice	AbstractForensic nurse examiners (FNE) are becoming integral partners in contemporary medicolegal systems worldwide. Existing forensic services have been proven inadequate to sufficiently address the vast crimes against women and children, victims of sexual and domestic violence, sociocultural crimes, abusive religious rituals, and atrocities that accompany armed conflict. Considering that nurses comprise the largest group of healthcare providers worldwide, forensic nurse examiners represent a previously unrecognized resource in universal healthcare and embody an ideal group to advance international considerations in global healthcare and social justice. Although specific legal concerns within the healthcare communities vary from country to country, all nations struggle with issues of public health and safety. A comprehensive multidisciplinary forensic education and training program for nurses will facilitate improved management of existing interpersonal and sexual violence crises while reducing an unnecessary back log of cases for forensic physicians. The addition of a forensic specialist in nursing science will provide a valuable resource to assist in the substantiation of prosecutors’ claims or aid in the exoneration of suspects who are falsely accused. Their unique contributions increase coordination and cooperation, share medical/forensic expertise, enhance the care of victims of crimes while augmenting forensic services, and act as a liaison in applicable responsibilities between healthcare institutions and law enforcement agencies. The relevant literature indicates that once the Forensic Nurse Examiner Response Team is trained, specialists in forensic nursing science practice independently under the auspices of a Director of Clinical Forensic Medicine or Chief Medical Examiner. This new generation of health and justice professionals will produce affirmative outcomes where the science of forensic nursing is practiced. The positive treatment of victims of gender based crime, an increase in successful prosecution, and the assurance of best specimens in evidence recovery will provide confidence in the community at large that justice has been served through these combined forensic services...medicine, nursing and the law	['SDG05']

After an assessment of progress against key gender equality indicators, we focus on two key components of the current gender equality &#039;architecture&#039;: employment regulation and policy and the work and care infrastructure that supports working women and gender equality more broadly. We review key developments in regulation providing minimum labour standards and anti-discrimination protections for women workers. We then turn to recent developments in the work and care infrastructure, including childcare, paid parental leave and equal pay. Despite having better regulatory and institutional arrangements than exist in some other developed economies, we conclude that without an explicit national gender equality policy framework, progress towards decent work for Australian working women is likely to be incremental at best	['SDG05']

On this basis, a hypothetical model as a basis for theoretical and hypothetical development in future research is proposed.                                           Design/methodology/approach                 – This paper presents a review of the literature on gender, trust, risk-taking and entrepreneurship. A hypothetical model that can form the basis of future research in the field of entrepreneurship is developed.                                           Findings                 – In recent years, the issue of gender and its effect on entrepreneurship has been the subject of much debate and controversies. While some studies have shown that gender differences tend to affect intentions to become an entrepreneur, other studies deny any significant differences in this regard. Among these, a significant number of studies reveal that women are less likely to engage in entrepreneurial activities than their male counterparts. One of the major reasons provided for these gender disparities is the tendency of women to be less predisposed to taking risk than their male counterparts. This may in itself be the resultant of gender differences in their predisposition to trust.                                           Research limitations/implications                 – The arguments and proposed model are in need of empirical testing and verifications. Future research may consider and test the validity of the model. Use of structural equation modeling in this regard may prove beneficial.                                           Practical implications                 – The proposed model may also be considered by governments and stakeholders vested with tasks of promoting the participation of females in entrepreneurial activities in various contexts. This would entail that the factors of risk-taking/aversion and propensity to trust be considered and alleviated.                                           Originality/value                 – In examining the underlying reasons for gender differences in entrepreneurial activities, the research to date has not incorporated the interplay of risk propensity and the propensity to trust. The proposed model incorporates these to help unravel the “enigma” of gender differences in entrepreneurship.             </jats:sec	['SDG05']
10.1027/1864-9335/a000227	People judge male sexism more leniently when women emasculate men	Abstract. While overt sexism has become less acceptable in recent years, sexism frequently goes unchallenged by observers for a variety of reasons. In the present investigation, we propose that people may excuse men’s sexist remarks when the remarks follow a manhood threat caused by a woman. In Study 1, we found that a man’s sexist remark buffered against the emasculating effect of a threat to his masculinity from an ex-girlfriend. In Study 2, we further show that observers excuse a man’s sexist remark following a competitive loss to a woman to the extent that they perceive him as less manly as a result. We replicate this finding in Study 3 while ruling out two competing explanations. We discuss the implication that sexism prevention efforts need to identify and address gender-related contexts where sexism is excused in order for efforts to move toward its prevention. </jats:p	['SDG05']
10.1177/0958928715594545	Why call it ‘equality’ when it should be ‘achievement’? A proposal to un-correct the ‘corrected gender gaps’ in the EU Gender Equality Index	This study critically reviews the new Gender Equality Index (GEI) proposed by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) in 2013, arguing that the way in which it has been defined can be misleading for its potential users. The GEI is defined to ensure that good scores in the index are reflective of both low gender gaps and high levels of overall achievement. The study finds that the GEI values are largely driven by differences in overall achievement levels between countries rather than by gender differences within them, a disturbing issue that unduly penalizes low-income countries for factors that are not related to gender norms or discriminatory practices and which might lead to the elaboration of ill-targeted policies. In order to overcome this problem, we introduce a new version of the GEI that gets rid of its achievement component and which is much simpler to interpret. </jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1177/0886260514556768	Dating Violence and Substance Use: Exploring the Context of Adolescent Relationships	The connection between adolescent dating violence (ADV) and substance use is important to consider because of the serious consequences for teens who engage in these behaviors. Although prior research shows that these two health problems are related, the context in which they occur is missing, including when (i.e., the timeline) in the relationship these events occur. To fill this gap, eight sex-specific focus groups were conducted with 39 high school–aged teens, all of whom had experienced prior relationship violence. Adolescents discussed using alcohol and/or drugs at the start of the dating relationship and after the relationship ended as a way to cope with the break-up. Alcohol and drugs were also used throughout to cope with being in an abusive relationship. The intersection of ADV and substance use occurred during instances when both partners were using alcohol and/or drugs, as well as when only one partner was using. These findings provide support for prevention and intervention programs that consider the intersection of ADV and substance use.</jats:p	['SDG05']
10.1371/journal.pone.0145931	On the compliance of women engineers with a gendered scientific system	There has been considerable effort in the last decade to increase the participation of  women in engineering through various policies. However, there has been little empirical  research on gender disparities in engineering which help underpin the effective preparation,  co-ordination, and implementation of the science and technology (S&T) policies. This article  aims to present a comprehensive gendered analysis of engineering publications across different specialties and provide a cross-gender analysis of research output and scientific  impact of engineering researchers in academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. For  this purpose, 679,338 engineering articles published from 2008 to 2013 are extracted from  the Web of Science database and 974,837 authorships are analyzed. The structures of  co-authorship collaboration networks in different engineering disciplines are examined,  highlighting the role of female scientists in the diffusion of knowledge. The findings reveal  that men dominate 80% of all the scientific production in engineering. Women engineers  publish their papers in journals with higher Impact Factors than their male peers, but their  work receives lower recognition (fewer citations) from the scientific community. Engineers  —regardless of their gender—contribute to the reproduction of the male-dominated scientific structures through forming and repeating their collaborations predominantly with men.  The results of this study call for integration of data driven gender-related policies in existing  S&T discourse	['SDG05']
10.4018/978-1-4666-8611-3.ch011	Women in transition: Institutional change and women's situation in Poland	The chapter describes institutional and gender relations in the society and the economy, the influence of institutions and the state that may lead to the institutional change, which is understood as an adaptation of habits of thought to changing circumstances. The situation of women in Poland has been chosen to illustrate this phenomenon. Poland, as a country, has gone through major social, political and economic transformations in the last 25 years, and they have had important impacts on people's lives. The analysis of the impact of major transformations in Poland's post-war political economy enables the distinguishing factors (policies, institutions) that guarantee certain continuity in a society, and the ones that lead to institutional changes. Knowledge about the mechanisms of institutional change in the context of gender relations is helpful in designing policies aiming at promoting gender equality in societies as well as economies.</jats:p	['SDG05']

10.5964/ejop.v12i4.984	If stigmatized, self-esteem is not enough: Effects of sexism, self-esteem and social identity on leadership aspiration	Ambivalent sexism has many pernicious consequences. Since gender stereotypes also affect leadership roles, the present research investigated the effects of ambivalent sexism on envisioning oneself as a leader. Our studies tested the influence of sexist attitudes (toward women – Study 1 – and men – Study 2) on leadership aspiration, taking into account the interaction among ambivalent attitudes, personal characteristics (e.g. self-esteem), and group processes (e.g. level of identification with gender). Specifically, the current study used a 3 (sexism: hostile, benevolent, control) x 2 (social identification: high, low) x 2 (self-esteem: high, low) factorial design. 178 women participated in Study 1. Results showed that, although sexism was not recognised as a form of prejudice and did not trigger negative emotions, in sexist conditions high-identified women increase their leadership aspiration. In Study 2 men (N= 184) showed to recognise hostility as a form of prejudice, to experience more negative emotions, but to be not influenced in leadership aspiration. For both men and women self-esteem had a significant main effect on leadership aspiration.</p	['SDG05']

Searches were conducted using PubMed, Popline and Web of Science search engines in May 2013 to examine literature published between January 1990 and December 2012. Among the 46 articles included in the review, the majority were conducted in South Asia (n=24). Household decision-making (n=21) and mobility (n=17) were the most commonly examined domains of women’s empowerment. Findings show that the relationship between empowerment and family planning is complex, with mixed positive and null associations. Consistently positive associations between empowerment and family planning outcomes were found for most family planning outcomes but those investigations represented fewer than two-fifths of the analyses. Current use of contraception was the most commonly studied family planning outcome, examined in more than half the analyses, but reviewed articles showed inconsistent findings. This review provides the first critical synthesis of the literature and assesses existing evidence between women’s empowerment and family planning use.</jats:p	['SDG05']
10.1515/mmcks-2016-0019	The heterogeneous landscape of innovation in female led-businesses - Cross-country comparisons	Female led-businesses are nowadays regarded as a vehicle for worldwide economic and social wellbeing. Seen as a mechanism for better social inclusion, empowerment, wide institutional change and local economic development, female entrepreneurship has been the focus of many scholarly pursuits. However, one field in which the interest in female-led businesses has been somewhat overlooked and overshadowed by other topics is the field of innovation studies. There are various national and international programs meant to increase the level of innovativeness of female-led businesses and there are reports presenting somewhat contradictory results in which women business owners are portrayed either as more innovative or at a disadvantage when it comes to the resources needed for innovation in comparison to their male counterparts. Thus, this study seeks to disentangle the various aspects which affect the landscape of innovation in female led-businesses by focusing on the way in which the national contexts creates opportunities or barriers for innovation. Based on the qualitative data provided by the GEM 2012 Adult Population Survey, we show that, in the case of the six countries included in the sample, the landscape is highly heterogeneous and that macrolevel indicators such as percentage of female entrepreneurs, public support for high growth female entrepreneurship and gender equality are not capable of fully explaining the innovation behavior of female-led businesses. The results presented here contribute to advancing the research on innovation and female entrepreneurship by opening up new avenues for research which will renounce the paradigm of an ideal type of female-led business, and start to seriously take into consideration the heterogeneity of these businesses and of the landscapes in which they operate	['SDG05']

Types and risk in primary care health users in Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico	Objetivo: Identificar la prevalencia y el tipo de violencia de pareja en mujeres usuarias de una unidad de atención primaria y estimar los riesgos para cada tipo de violencia. Diseño: Casos (incidentes) y controles. Emplazamiento: Unidad de atención primaria en Cancún, Quintana Roo, México. Participantes: Mujeres mayores de 18 años con vida en pareja en los últimos 12 meses. Mediciones principales: Mediante escala para identificación de violencia validada para población mexicana, se evaluó: violencia de pareja total, violencia física, psicológica y sexual. Antecedente de violencia y variables sociodemográficas. Se determinó chi cuadrado para variables categóricas y odds ratio (OR) para la estimación de riesgo. Resultados: La violencia de pareja total fue del 15,05%, y la violencia psicológica, del 37,3%. En violencia total se observaron diferencias en edad, nivel socioeconómico, estado civil, antecedente de violencia y consumo de alcohol en la pareja (p < 0,05). El riesgo se incrementó en mayores de 40 años (OR: 2,09; IC 95%: 1,07-4,11), antecedente de violencia (OR: 5,9; IC 95%: 2,8-12,44) y consumo de alcohol por parte de la pareja (OR: 12,38; IC 95%: 2,15-29,59). Nivel socioeconómico bajo (OR: 0,384; IC 95%: 0,19-0,74) y estar en unión libre (OR: 0,507; IC 95%: 0,27-0,95) son factores relacionados con menor violencia de pareja. Conclusiones: La violencia sexual predominó en las usuarias de la atención primaria, y el riesgo de que se presente esta conducta se incrementa con el consumo de bebidas alcohólicas en la pareja y el antecedente de violencia, pero la unión libre y el nivel socioeconómico bajo están relacionados con menor violencia de pareja	['SDG05']
10.1177/1035304617690095	The implications of Australian women's precarious employment for the later pension age	AbstractThe increase in pension eligibility ages in Australia, as elsewhere, throws into relief the consequences of gender inequality in employment. Because of career histories in lower paid and more insecure employment, a higher percentage of women than men are dependent on the age pension rather than on superannuation or savings and investments, and so will be disproportionately affected by deferred access. Yet, fewer women than men hold the types of ‘good jobs’ that will sustain them into an older age. Women are more likely to be sequestered in precarious employment, with reduced job quality and a greater potential for premature workforce exit. This article counterposes macro-level data drawn from national cross-sectional labour force statistics and the longitudinal Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey, with case study analysis, based on interviews with 38 women in midlife insecure jobs, in order to identify the types of life course and labour market barriers that contribute to women’s reliance on the pension and the systemic disadvantage that will render them particularly vulnerable to any further erosion of this safety net. The analysis moves between this empirical evidence and a discussion, drawing on the theoretical literature, of the failure in equal opportunity endeavours over recent decades and what this means for later life workforce participation for women.</jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1108/ijes-04-2017-0021	Valuing different shades of blue: From diversity to inclusion and the challenge of harnessing difference	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine Australian efforts to promote gender equality in policing, suggesting that future police leaders will be confronted with the challenge of ensuring that their organisations are not only demographically diverse, but more importantly, that they are inclusive.   Design/methodology/approach The paper utilises current Australian efforts to promote gender equality (case study), as a means of examining the way in which the conceptual distinction between diversity and inclusion plays out in practice.   Findings The paper finds that current efforts to promote gender equality are being used as a proxy for diversity more broadly and are overly focussed upon demographic diversity. Less attention is being paid to the development of inclusive work environments, which will present a challenge to future leaders who are required to manage more heterogenous workforces.   Research limitations/implications Research into the efficacy of existing strategies, which will further theoretical debate, is proposed, with a call for research by those from a wider range of disciplines, in addition to psychology and management studies, being made.   Practical implications It is recommended that policing organisations utilise language focussed upon inclusion rather than diversity and foster cultures of learning, beginning at the academy.   Originality/value The paper contributes to the global debate on workforce diversity by drawing on a Southern Hemisphere perspective on contemporary efforts in policing. This complements extant studies on diversity which emanate primarily from the UK and USA, and provides an important reflection for police organisations across the world as they proceed with good intentions around creating much needed cultures of difference in thinking and operating. </jats:sec	['SDG05']

The way in which people are affected by or impact on water availability, quality and management is quite heterogeneous; and it has a distinct gender dimension. Social relations between women and men result in gendered roles that vary between social strata, cultures, ethnicities and generations. In traditional societies women are often the water seekers and carriers, while their involvement in decision-making is limited. This article focuses on women’s agency for sustainable use and management of water resources. It provides examples from Armenia and Ukraine demonstrating women’s civil society contributions to the development and implementation of the Protocol on Water and Health. It shows how women’s meaningful participation has made a difference, and sheds light on the preconditions for meaningful involvement of women’s civil society in processes of water cooperation and participatory water governance.</jats:p	['SDG05']

This concept has been developed because some nations have introduced voluntary policies to regulate and increase the proportion of female directors on corporate boards. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review previous research based on board gender diversity as a corporate governance mechanism and its effect on some firms’ business decisions: financial reporting quality (FRQ), firm performance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting.   Design/methodology/approach The authors focus on the agency and stakeholder theory to examine the link between female directors on boards and FRQ, CSR disclosure and firm performance.   Findings This review provides researchers a structure that can identify the benefits and disadvantages of including female directors on boards regarding three particular corporate outcomes (FRQ, firm performance and CSR reporting).   Originality/value This study provides a review of past literature on firm performance, CSR disclosure and FRQ from 1975 to 2017, and it contributes to past research by giving a broad overview of the main results of the association between female board directors and corporate decisions. The findings have implications for governments, academics and company managers. </jats:sec	['SDG05']
10.18865/ed.28.s2.317	Creating safe spaces: A community health worker-academic partnered approach to addressing intimate partner violence	Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a persistent public health problem in the United States, with an estimated one in three women experiencing rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner within her lifetime. Non-Hispanic Black women disproportionately experience IPV, but there has been limited success in implementing culturally appropriate preven­tion programs and services for members of this population. Community health workers (CHWs) are trusted members of under-resourced communities who provide reliable health information and improve the cultural appropriateness of service delivery and may be a vital resource for developing new IPV interventions. Guided by the prin­ciples of community partnered participatory research, we developed the CHW-led Safe Spaces project, which aimed to establish a strong academic-community partnership to focus on issues related to experiences of IPV and the prevention of IPV in New Orleans. In this article, we describe the development of our partnership including the formation of an advisory board, creation of a broad-based stakeholder coalition, offering a community partnered participatory research training, conducting IPV education and out­reach, and establishing a research agenda. Our processes are replicable and lessons learned may be relevant to other groups seeking to address IPV by leveraging the strengths of community-academic collabora­tions and CHWs.Ethn Dis. 2018;28(Suppl 2):317-324; doi:10.18865/ed.28.S2.317.</jats:p	['SDG05']

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was administered to females ages 16–29 years seeking care in five family planning clinics in Northern California (N=1278). RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence, 19% reported experiencing pregnancy coercion, and 15% reported birth control sabotage. One third of respondents reporting partner violence (35%) also reported reproductive control. Both pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage were associated with unintended pregnancy (AOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.36, 2.46, and AOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.14, 2.20, respectively). In analyses stratified by partner violence exposure, associations of reproductive control with unintended pregnancy persisted only among women with a history of partner violence. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage are common among young women utilizing family planning clinics, and in the context of partner violence, are associated with increased risk for unintended pregnancy	['SDG05']

We used a Swedish school-based population survey of sexual attitudes and experiences (response rate 77%) and investigated literature-based variables across sexually coercive (SEX), non-sexual conduct problem (CP), and normal control (NC) participants to identify general and specific risk/protective factors for sexual coercion. Among 1,933 male youth, 101 (5.2%) reported sexual coercion (ever talked or forced somebody into genital, oral, or anal sex) (SEX), 132 (6.8%) were classified as CP, and the remaining 1,700 (87.9%) as NC. Of 29 tested variables, 25 were more common in both SEX and CP compared to NC youth, including minority ethnicity, separated parents, vocational study program, risk-taking, aggressiveness, depressive symptoms, substance abuse, sexual victimization, extensive sexual experiences, and sexual preoccupation. When compared to CP youth only, SEX youth more often followed academic study programs, used less drugs and were less risk-taking. Further, SEX more frequently than CP youth reported gender stereotypic and pro-rape attitudes, sexual preoccupation, prostitution, and friends using violent porn. Finally, in a multivariate logistic regression, academic study program, pro-rape attitudes, sexual preoccupation, and less risk-taking independently remained more strongly associated with SEX compared to CP offending. In conclusion, several sociodemographic, family, and individual risk/protective factors were common to non-sexual and sexually coercive antisocial behavior in late adolescence. However, pro-rape cognitions, and sexual preoccupation, were sexuality-related, specific risk factors. The findings could inform preventive efforts and the assessment and treatment of sexually coercive male youth	['SDG05']

10.2190/iq.30.4.f	Intimate partner violence: Prevalence and perceptions of married men in Ibadan, Nigeria	In sub-Saharan Africa rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) are high. Thus, identifying reasons for abuse is crucial in ensuring women's health. Hence, mens perception of IPV was assessed, and prevalence of abuse determined. Survey of 820 married men from six urban communities in Ibadan was done using interviewer administered questionnaire. Four focus group discussions were conducted. Lifetime prevalence of perpetration of physical abuse was 25.1%, while psychological violence was 44.4%. Two hundred and forty (29.3%) had ever perpetrated sexual violence and 23.2% economic violence. At least one of these forms of violence had been perpetrated by 44.1% of the respondents. “Being rude” (66.4%) and “insufficient care of the children” (54.3%) were common justifications for IPV. Motive of the abuse were “to make partner responsible” (60.3%) and “to obtain respect” (59.9%). Predictors of perpetrating violence were being in polygamous unions (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.11–3.03), consuming alcohol (AOR 1.67; 95% CI: 1.10–2.53), and being Moslem (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.21–2.910). Men with inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes had greater likelihood of perpetrating IPV (AOR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.37–3.26 and AOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.33–3.27). IPV was also associated with young age. Premarital counseling on how to resolve conflict without resulting to violence and early education of boys on violence to women is recommended. </jats:p	['SDG05']

Since incarceration disproportionately affects minorities, excluding inmates from surveys may bias national obesity estimates. Including inmates may also help explain racial obesity disparities among men. This descriptive study summarizes obesity prevalence among US male inmates and analyzes the effect of incarceration on national prevalence estimates. Data for male inmates came from the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails and the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. Data for the non-incarcerated US adult male population came from the 2004 National Health Interview Survey. Self-reported weight and height data were analyzed from men aged 25-59 years for all surveys (obesity equaled BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m(2)). Pooled inmate obesity prevalence was less than non-incarcerated estimates across all race/ethnic-education subgroups. However, unlike non-incarcerated estimates, inmates had obesity disparities between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. Merging inmate and non-incarcerated estimates lowered obesity prevalence among men aged 25-39 with lower education levels. Merged estimates showed a positive obesity gradient within Whites by education. This study indicates that the exclusion of inmates from national obesity estimates leads to overestimates in obesity prevalence, particularly for low SES White and Black men	['SDG05']

10.1093/cdj/bsr039	The construction of political agency: South Asian women and political activism	Abstract                This article draws on research conducted with South Asian women working in a variety of organizations ranging from those that provide specialist services to training and anti-racist work. It is argued that despite stereotyping, these women have shown agency through involvement in civic organizations which has been crucial in understanding issues that are specifically relevant to South Asian women, for example, forced marriage and honour killings. The article also engages with feminist debates around the construction of political agency and its role in influencing social change and transformation within the South Asian community. The empowerment of women is discussed with reference to its central role in enabling them to take control over their lives.</jats:p	['SDG05']

Somado a esta revisão, o artigo traz resultados de um estudo de caso com abordagem qualitativa sobre um programa governamental de prevenção e atenção à violência doméstica e familiar do Sul do Brasil. Além do trabalho desenvolvido com mulheres em situação de violência, esse programa passou a atuar, em 2004, com HAV, atividade pioneira nesse estado e, à época, uma das poucas realizadas no Brasil por uma organização governamental. Os resultados obtidos a partir deste estudo mostraram que, apesar de os serviços de atendimento a HAV representarem um desafio adicional para o complexo campo de ação voltado à prevenção, atenção e enfrentamento à violência doméstica e familiar contra a mulher, eles podem, ao mesmo tempo, constituir novas possibilidades para esse campo, à medida que, aliados às ações já dirigidas às mulheres, podem contribuir para diminuir essa violência e promover a equidade de gênero	['SDG05']

10.1186/1742-4755-8-25	A review of studies of parent-child communication about sexuality and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa	Abstract Parent-child sexuality communication has been identified as a protective factor for adolescent sexual and reproductive health, including HIV infection. The available literature on this topic in sub-Saharan Africa is increasing; however a systematic review of studies has not been conducted. This article reviews the literature in the area of parental or caregiver and child communication about sexuality and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. A review of peer reviewed literature published between 1980 and April 2011 was conducted. Communication process studies investigating the frequency, content, style, tone of discussions, preferences, as well as associations with and barriers to sexuality communication are reviewed. In addition, studies which examine behavioral associations with parent-child sexuality communication, and intervention studies to improve parent-child sexuality communication are examined. The findings from process studies suggest wide variation in terms of frequency of discussions, with a range of socio-demographic and other factors associated with sexuality communication. Overall, findings demonstrate that discussions tend to be authoritarian and uni-directional, characterized by vague warnings rather than direct, open discussion. Moreover, parents and young people report a number of barriers to open dialogue, including lack of knowledge and skills, as well as cultural norms and taboos. Findings are less clear when it comes to associations between parental communication and adolescent sexual activity and contraception use. However, nascent indications from intervention research suggest positive findings with increases in frequency and comfort of discussions, among other outcomes. Gaps in the research are identified and discussed with implications for future studies.</p	['SDG05']

10.1891/0886-6708.26.5.608	Sexual violence victimization among female secondary school students in eastern Ethiopia	Behavioral, lifestyle, and relationship factors have all been identified as risk factors that increase a woman’s vulnerability to sexual violence victimization. However, it remains unclear which risk factors most strongly increase young women’s vulnerability to sexual violence victimization because most studies only examine a few factors simultaneously. Using a cross-sectional sample of 764 female secondary school students from eastern Ethiopia, multivariate analyses revealed that high-rejection sensitivity, having multiple sexual partners, the frequent watching of pornography, and use of alcohol or other soft drugs (Khat or shisha) are factors associated with higher levels of sexual violence victimization. The overall rates of victimization is high in this group, with 68% of the young women studied having experienced at least one instance of sexual violence victimization. Based on type of sexual perpetration, 52% of the young women were victimized by at least one instance of sexual offence, 56% by sexual assault, 25% by sexual coercion, and 15% by sexual aggression. Qualitative data gathered from interviews of extracurricular club members and school officials and focus group discussion with students were used to further augment and illustrate results from the quantitative data. Several suggestions for intervention are presented in light of these results.</jats:p	['SDG05']

Some intrinsic elements make it however difficult to find a format that is satisfying to all. In the first place there is the fact that the HDIM will not produce a negotiated document, which makes it difficult to capture the interest of governments. Furthermore, the growth of the European Union, which speaks with one voice, entails that interest mainly goes to the fringe of the OSCE area. On the other hand, several seminars (e.g. Roma and Sinti, Religious Freedom and Women's Rights) have contributed to enhanced interest within the OSCE . It should never be forgotten that the HDIM and other meetings are a tool, not an aim in themselves.          </jats:sec	['SDG05']
10.1177/1524838011426015	When can i help? a conceptual framework for the prevention of sexual violence through bystander intervention	The bystander intervention approach is gaining popularity as a means for engaging communities in sexual assault prevention, especially on college campuses. Many bystander programs are teaching community members how to intervene without first assisting them to identify the full range of opportunities when they can intervene. In this article, the authors review the literature on sexual violence bystander intervention and present a conceptual framework that lays out a continuum of bystander opportunities ranging from reactive situations after an assault has occurred, to situations before an assault has occurred (posing high to low risk to victims), as well as proactive situations where no risk to the victim is present. The implications of this typology are discussed in the context of program development, evaluation, and further research. </jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1098/rstb.2011.0290	The puzzle of monogamous marriage	The anthropological record indicates that approximately 85 per cent of human societies have permitted men to have more than one wife (polygynous marriage), and both empirical and evolutionary considerations suggest that large absolute differences in wealth should favour more polygynous marriages. Yet, monogamous marriage has spread across Europe, and more recently across the globe, even as absolute wealth differences have expanded. Here, we develop and explore the hypothesis that the norms and institutions that compose the modern package of monogamous marriage have been favoured by cultural evolution because of their group-beneficial effects—promoting success in inter-group competition. In suppressing intrasexual competition and reducing the size of the pool of unmarried men, normative monogamy reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. By assuaging the competition for younger brides, normative monogamy decreases (i) the spousal age gap, (ii) fertility, and (iii) gender inequality. By shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment, normative monogamy increases savings, child investment and economic productivity. By increasing the relatedness within households, normative monogamy reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide. These predictions are tested using converging lines of evidence from across the human sciences.</jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1080/02757206.2012.649270	Projected cultural histories of the cutting of female genitalia: A poor reflection as in a mirror	Current public debate on “female genital mutilation” often renders the impression that it is possible to draw an unambiguous line between acceptable and condemnable practices of female genital cutting. In this paper, the cultural histories of cutting of the female genitalia are presented and discussed. Available historical accounts of female circumcision practices in Africa reflect Western, mainly European, ideas and ideologies at certain points in time. In a sense, these descriptions have more to say about “us” than “them”. Further, the historical descriptions of female circumcision in Africa are intertwined with time-bound notions and cutting practices in Western countries in different epochs. Through retrospective reflections, it is possible to see how current commonsensical standpoints, among them the hegemony of a “zero tolerance” attitude regarding cutting of the female genitalia among Africans, are a product of a recently introduced perspective, and also how this generally accepted perspective may render it more difficult to present multi-faceted ethnographic accounts of lived experiences today	['SDG05']

10.1177/0959353511434416	Textual transformations of subjectivity in men's talk of gender-based violence	This study examined how men accounted for their violent behaviours against their intimate female partners. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 men from three men’s groups in Johannesburg, South Africa. All the men self-reported that they had committed acts of intimate partner violence previously, and the majority were from low-income, township settings. Dissociations, justifications and confessions featured as the predominant accounting forms that worked to transform participants’ subject positions from the ‘violent abuser’ to the ‘legitimately violent partner’ and even to the ‘changed man’. Attention is accorded to how gender ideologies and heteropatriarchal discourses legitimating male violence against women were reinforced, yet were at times challenged within their talk and through rhetorical devices. In line with a poststructuralist reading, the study highlights the complexities underpinning men’s varied meanings of violence. On the one hand, it reveals the agentic shifting of identities. On the other, it highlights the social discourses that are embedded in men’s talk and therefore inscribed into male subjectivities. </jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1017/s0305741012001208	Women sex-spies: Chastity, national dignity, legitimate government and Ding Ling's when i was in Xia Village	AbstractThis article examines 70 years of debate about Ding Ling's 1941 influential short story about a woman spy, “When I was in Xia Village.” In the article I show that the re-absorption of “our” female spies into post-conflict solidarity narratives is a fraught process. For national governments, the difficulty lies in asserting the moral legitimacy of their rule in the face of evidence about their deployment of women as sex spies. For national populations, the difficulty lies in the desire to construct reassuring victory stories within which peacetime normalcy can be restored. The diverse exegeses around Ding Ling's “Xia Village” reveal that even decades after the hostilities cease, “our” women sex spies still require an explanation to communities seeking to consolidate or “remember” their national virtue. The evolution of this process of “explaining” reveals the on-going importance of sexual morality to governance in current-day China. Specifically, through the analysis of the critiques of “Xia Village” the article demonstrates that female chastity has been and continues to be an important commodity in establishing and sustaining popular perceptions of the moral virtue of the PRC as a nation, and the CCP as its legitimate government.</jats:p	['SDG05']

One’s readiness to change may be one variable impacting their pursuit of treatment and other resources. The current study investigated correlates of readiness to change, and readiness to change’s impact on treatment utilization. Data was collected from 223 women residing in battered women’s shelters. Correlational analyses find that generally victims with more psychopathology and distress, as well as more social support, were more ready to change. PTSD symptoms, overall distress, and social support were the strongest predictors of readiness to change. Finally, victims higher in readiness to change were more likely to seek mental health treatment and other IPV-related services	['SDG05']
10.1016/j.wsif.2012.11.004	The ties that bind: Family barriers for adult women seeking to report childhood sexual assault in Australia	In this article, we observe that barriers to the disclosure and reporting of sexual assault reside within families. We draw on qualitative survey data, as well as interviews with adult victims of childhood sexual assault, to show how women are impeded by family members when attempting to disclose or report sexual assault. Taylor and Putt (2007) identified three ‘family constraints on [sexual violence] reporting’ for women from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds in Australia. These were: 1) Family denial that sexual violence exists, 2) Reluctance to report a partner perpetrator, and 3) Fear of being ostracised for bringing shame upon the family (p. 4). We examine whether similar barriers to reporting exist for adult female survivors of childhood sexual assault who are from non-CALD backgrounds. On the basis of our findings, we urge greater police and public recognition of, and sensitivity to barriers extant within non-CALD families that contribute to the under-reporting of sexual assault by women in Australia	['SDG05']
10.1177/0269758012447214	Victimhood in the carceral culture of women's prisons	This article is a cultural analysis of how sexualized violence in the United States penal system is mediated by neo-conservative configurations of victimization that work to obscure gendered and racialized dimensions of violence against women in prison. I argue that the meanings of the term ‘victim’ over the last decade have undergone significant rhetorical and ideological developments that affect imprisoned women along gendered and racialized lines. Special attention will be given to the position of victim and victimhood in US culture following the terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. I argue that a renewed socio-cultural shift towards neo-conservatism initiated in the 1980s has retrenched the view that the US has been emasculated and its sovereignty rendered vulnerable to attack. In this discursive space, victimhood is no longer a political category aimed at the mobilization of policy and law reforms but rather provides the context through which sexual violence inside women’s prisons gets obfuscated despite national efforts to address the prevalence of (male) prisoner rape. I suggest that the rape of women in prison is eclipsed by an anti-feminist backlash. </jats:p	['SDG05']

In this paper, I implicitly (1) question the view of ethics that stands behind many discussions in the ethics of humor; I do this by explicitly (2) focusing on what has been a chief preoccupation in the ethics of humor: the evaluation of humor. Does the immoral content of a joke make it more or less humorous? Specifically, I analyze whether a sexist joke is more humorous because of its sexism. Contra recent trends in the ethics of humor, I answer this question affirmatively. To this end, the paper presents a detailed and novel reading of Bergson's philosophy of humor, which I argue connects most easily and significantly to the alternate view of ethics I have in mind.</jats:p	['SDG05']

10.2190/hs.43.4.e	Human trafficking, labor brokering, and mining in Southern Africa: Responding to a decentralized and hidden public health disaster	Many southern African economies are dependent on the extractive industries. These industries rely on low-cost labor, often supplied by migrants, typically acquired through labor brokers. Very little attention has so far been paid to trafficking of men into extractive industries or its connection with trafficked women in the region's mining hubs. Recent reports suggest that labor-brokering practices foster human trafficking, both by exposing migrant men to lack of pay and exploitative conditions and by creating male migratory patterns that generate demand for sex workers and associated trafficking of women and girls. While trafficking in persons violates human rights, and thus remains a priority issue globally, there is little or no evidence of an effective political response to mine-related trafficking in southern Africa. This article concludes with recommendations for legal and policy interventions, as well as an enhanced public health response, which if implemented would help reduce human trafficking toward mining sites. </jats:p	['SDG05']

We examine these gaps in an epidemiological study, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), of a large, nationally representative sample. METHODS: The sample was drawn from Wave 2 NESARC respondents (N = 34,653). Adults with current cannabis use disorders and nicotine dependence (CUD + ND) (n = 74), CUD only (n = 100), and ND only (n = 3424) were compared on psychiatric disorders, psychosocial correlates (e.g., binge drinking; partner violence), and physical health correlates (e.g., medical conditions). RESULTS: Relative to those with CUD only, respondents with CUD + ND were significantly more likely to meet criteria for bipolar disorder, Clusters A and B personality disorders, and narcissistic personality disorder, and reported engaging in a significantly higher number of antisocial behaviors. Relative to those with ND only, respondents with CUD + ND were significantly more likely to meet criteria for bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and paranoid, schizotypal, narcissistic, and borderline personality disorders; were significantly more likely to report driving under the influence of alcohol and being involved in partner violence; and reported engaging in a significantly higher number of antisocial behaviors. CUD + ND was not associated with physical health correlates. CONCLUSIONS: Poor treatment outcomes for adults with co-occurring cannabis use disorders and nicotine dependence may be explained in part by differences in psychiatric and psychosocial problems	['SDG05']

10.5901/mjss.2013.v4n10p580	The power of women in the armed forces	The aim of this paper is to investigate the various models and the best practices of the participation of women in the armed forces, their influence and integration in a traditionally recognized as a men field. The article examines the main challenges that female military personnel face along the military career and sheds light on the mechanism for the protection and implementation of female rights. Then, it puts forward that the transformation of the armed forces provides a good opportunity to increase the role of women in the armed forces. The paper suggests that based on the experience women have the ability to solve complex, unstable, doubtful and confusing situations related to war. However, this natural endowment should be coupled with operational experience in order to increase their self confidence and their abilities multiplying their power inside the armed forces. Women, with their skills, might offer comparative advantage in the resources needed for the wars of the future. The paper conludes that supporting the gender equality in the armed forces, the involvement of the women in all levels of military decision making and ensuring that they get full and equal rights in the armed forces is key to successful transformation of the armed forces	['SDG05']

10.1007/s11682-013-9246-z	Prolonged hemodynamic response during incidental facial emotion processing in inter-episode bipolar I disorder	This fMRI study examined whether hemodynamic responses to affectively-salient stimuli were abnormally prolonged in remitted bipolar disorder, possibly representing a novel illness biomarker. A group of 18 DSM-IV bipolar I-diagnosed adults in remission and a demographically-matched control group performed an event-related fMRI gender-discrimination task in which face stimuli had task-irrelevant neutral, happy or angry expressions designed to elicit incidental emotional processing. Participants’ brain activation was modeled using a “fully informed” SPM5 basis set. Mixed-model ANOVA tested for diagnostic group differences in BOLD response amplitude and shape within brain regions-of-interest selected from ALE meta-analysis of previous comparable fMRI studies. Bipolar-diagnosed patients had a generally longer duration and/or later-peaking hemodynamic response in amygdala and numerous prefrontal cortex brain regions. Data are consistent with existing models of bipolar limbic hyperactivity, but the prolonged frontolimbic response more precisely details abnormalities recognized in previous studies. Prolonged hemodynamic responses were unrelated to stimulus type, task performance, or degree of residual mood symptoms, suggesting an important novel trait vulnerability brain dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Bipolar patients also failed to engage pregenual cingulate and left orbitofrontal cortex – regions important to models of automatic emotion regulation – while engaging a delayed dorsolateral prefrontal cortex response not seen in controls. These results raise questions about whether there are meaningful relationships between bipolar dysfunction of specific ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions believed to automatically regulate emotional reactions and the prolonged responses in more lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex	['SDG05']

10.1186/1744-8603-10-47	Community empowerment and involvement of female sex workers in targeted sexual and reproductive health interventions in Africa: A systematic review	Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) experience high levels of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) morbidity, violence and discrimination. Successful SRH interventions for FSWs in India and elsewhere have long prioritised community mobilisation and structural interventions, yet little is known about similar approaches in African settings. We systematically reviewed community empowerment processes within FSW SRH projects in Africa, and assessed them using a framework developed by Ashodaya, an Indian sex worker organisation. Methods: In November 2012 we searched Medline and Web of Science for studies of FSW health services in Africa, and consulted experts and websites of international organisations. Titles and abstracts were screened to identify studies describing relevant services, using a broad definition of empowerment. Data were extracted on service-delivery models and degree of FSW involvement, and analysed with reference to a four-stage framework developed by Ashodaya. This conceptualises community empowerment as progressing from (1) initial engagement with the sex worker community, to (2) community involvement in targeted activities, to (3) ownership, and finally, (4) sustainability of action beyond the community. Results: Of 5413 articles screened, 129 were included, describing 42 projects. Targeted services in FSW 'hotspots' were generally isolated and limited in coverage and scope, mostly offering only free condoms and STI treatment. Many services were provided as part of research activities and offered via a clinic with associated community outreach. Empowerment processes were usually limited to peer-education (stage 2 of framework). Community mobilisation as an activity in its own right was rarely documented and while most projects successfully engaged communities, few progressed to involvement, community ownership or sustainability. Only a few interventions had evolved to facilitate collective action through formal democratic structures (stage 3). These reported improved sexual negotiating power and community solidarity, and positive behavioural and clinical outcomes. Sustainability of many projects was weakened by disunity within transient communities, variable commitment of programmers, low human resource capacity and general resource limitations.  Conclusions: Most FSW SRH projects in Africa implemented participatory processes consistent with only the earliest stages of community empowerment, although isolated projects demonstrate proof of concept for successful empowerment interventions in African settings	['SDG05']

10.17730/humo.73.3.m11l7j58w0w7x173	A foreign woman researcher in a Purdah society: Opportunities and challenges for knowledge production in the 2000s	This paper aims to further discussions on access to “foreign” worlds, limits in knowledge production, and the role of gender relations in field research. What follows is an engagement with arguments developed by Hanna Papanek and Carroll Pastner in this journal some decades ago. They both drew on fieldwork experiences in Pakistan to argue that foreign women fieldworkers can (sometimes) take advantage of ambiguities in the social structures of Purdah societies, that is, societies characterized by “sexual segregation and the seclusion of women” (Pastner 1982:262), to flexibly position themselves and to be able to interact with both men and women. This paper rethinks their arguments and evaluates the current situation on the basis of fieldwork experience as a foreign woman in Pakistan in the late 2000s. It argues that possibilities for foreign women to get physical access to men’s worlds, although still available, remain limited and in some ways have become more restricted (including access to women’s worlds) due to political developments in recent decades. The paper also argues that, irrespective of the feasibility of physical access to other gender’s worlds, it is necessary to reflect on subjectivities through which access to “foreign” worlds is mediated and knowledge is produced	['SDG05']

Banyard’s presentation gave us food for thought as we consider what such novel approaches may look like. New and innovative approaches that are multifaceted, comprehensive, and informed by theory are key. The ecological model can inform our understanding of the issue, the risk and protective factors associated, and the design and implementation of prevention efforts. It is critically important to engage college students in these efforts to create interventions that are culturally appropriate for college students. We must also meet students where they are, utilizing social marketing campaigns and capitalizing on social media and the use of communication technologies. Together, such efforts will facilitate our ultimate goal of reducing, if not eliminating, violence against women on college campuses. </jats:p	['SDG05']

We examined the effects of gender abuse (enacted stigma), depressive symptoms, and demographic, economic, and lifestyle factors on substance use among transgender women.  Methods. We conducted a 3-year prospective study (December 2004 to September 2007) of 230 transgender women aged 19 to 59 years from the New York Metropolitan Area. Statistical techniques included generalized estimating equations with logistic and linear regression links.  Results. Six-month prevalence of any substance use at baseline was 76.2%. Across assessment points, gender abuse was associated with alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, or any substance use during the previous 6 months, the number of days these substances were used during the previous month, and the number of substances used. Additional modeling associated changes in gender abuse with changes in substance use across time. Associations of gender abuse and substance use were mediated 55% by depressive symptoms. Positive associations of employment income, sex work, transgender identity, and hormone therapy with substance use were mediated 19% to 42% by gender abuse.  Conclusions. Gender abuse, in conjunction with depressive symptoms, is a pervasive and moderately strong risk factor for substance use among transgender women. Improved substance abuse treatment is sorely needed for this population. </jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1177/1473325014526275	Ghanaian (Akan) women’s experiences of widowhood and property rights violations: An ethnographic inquiry	This study, part of a larger ethnography, explores the interaction of national inheritance laws and local culture in the everyday lives of Ghanaian (Akan) women who have been widowed. Property ownership is fundamental to women’s economic survival, empowerment, and liberation from abusive relationships. Yet millions of women around the world, especially those in developing nations lose their rights to own, inherit, and manage property following the deaths of their husbands. This research took place in two cities and two villages each in the Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo regions. Methods included participant observation conducted over a four-month period in and around the homes of women who had been widowed and focused observations of women’s interactions with family members in the home. In-depth interviews conducted in Twi with 20 widows, five from each site, focused on women’s experiences of widowhood. Thirteen women described property rights violations occurring when they were vulnerable due to bereavement and/or widowhood rites, and resulting in long-term economic challenges for them and their children. Their experiences suggest that local, customary laws have constrained the implementation of national, progressive laws to eliminate gender discrimination in inheritance. Women also described their sources of resilience including social support from family and friends, spirituality, and their own advocacy for other women. We discuss implications for international social work, especially developing an understanding of local challenges and resources foundational to the design and implementation of effective, culturally sensitive policy, and intervention. </jats:p	['SDG05']
10.1017/s0144686x15000227	Female disability disadvantage: A global perspective on sex differences in physical function and disability	ABSTRACTThe objectives were to determine whether women always fare more poorly in terms of physical function and disability across countries that vary widely in terms of their level of development, epidemiologic context and level of gender equality. Sex differences in self-reported and objective measures of disability and physical function were compared among older adults aged 55–85 in the United States of America, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, China, Indonesia and among the Tsimane of Bolivia using population-based studies collected between 2001 and 2011. Data were analysed using logistic and ordinary least-squares regression. Confidence intervals were examined to see whether the effect of being female differed significantly between countries. In all countries, women had consistently worse physical functioning (both self-reported and objectively measured). Women also tended to report more difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), although differences were not always significant. In general, sex differences across measures were less pronounced in China. In Korea, women had significantly lower grip strength, but sex differences in ADL difficulty were non-significant or even reversed. Education and marital status helped explain sex differences. Overall, there was striking similarity in the magnitude and direction of sex differences across countries despite considerable differences in context, although modest variations in the effect of sex were observed.</jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1177/1097184x14557494	Men’s Emotions: Heteromasculinity, Emotional Reflexivity, and Intimate Relationships	This article focuses on the underresearched topic of how masculinity relates to emotional forms of caring within heterosexual relationships. Both scholarly and common sense thinking, often present heterosexual male partners as unable and/or unwilling to do emotion work, leaving women burdened with this task. However, contemporary relational complexity increasingly requires emotional reflexivity. Such reflexivity entails interpretations of one’s own and others’ emotions, and acting in light of those interpretations. The question here is to what extent and how that emotional reflexivity might effect a reshaping of heteromasculinity toward more caring forms of emotionality? Drawing on interviews with heterosexual couples in distance relationships, it is argued that emotional reflexivity may produce a variety of ways of relationally gendering emotions. Those who seem to adhere to ideas of men as emotionally restricted may claim tactile forms of emotional expression. However, there may be limitations to these forms in certain circumstances, and this may prompt a reflexive reorientation of heteromasculine emotionalities toward more verbal forms of support. The point of seeking to illustrate that masculinity and emotionality are open to such reflexive shifts is to debunk essentialist views of gendered emotionality which undermine efforts to achieve greater gender equality in intimate life.</jats:p	['SDG05']

We assessed the determinants of sexual activity and pregnancy among young unmarried women in urban Kenya.Baseline data from five urban areas in Kenya (Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Machakos, and Kakamega) collected in 2010 by the Measurement, Learning & Evaluation project were used. Women aged 15-24 years, who had never been married, and were not living with a male partner at the time of survey (weighted n = 2020) were included. Using weighted, multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and logistic regression analyses, we assessed factors associated with three outcome measures: time to first sex, time to first pregnancy, and teenage pregnancy.One-half of our sample had ever had sex; the mean age at first sex among the sexually-experienced was 17.7 (± 2.6) years. About 15% had ever been pregnant; mean age at first pregnancy was 18.3 (± 2.2) years. Approximately 11% had a teenage pregnancy. Three-quarters (76%) of those who had ever been pregnant (weighted n = 306) reported the pregnancy was unwanted at the time. Having secondary education was associated with a later time to first sex and first pregnancy. In addition, religion, religiosity, and employment status were associated with time to first sex while city of residence, household size, characteristics of household head, family planning knowledge and misconceptions, and early sexual debut were significantly associated with time to first pregnancy. Education, city of residence, household wealth, early sexual debut, and contraceptive use at sexual debut were associated with teenage pregnancy for those 20-24 years.Understanding risk and protective factors of youth sexual and reproductive health can inform programs to improve young people's long-term potential by avoiding early and unintended pregnancies	['SDG05']

In the western Himalayas of India, a majority of residents maintain a livelihood strategy that includes a combination of subsistence or small-scale agriculture, livestock rearing, seasonal or long-term migration, and localized natural resource extraction. While warming temperatures, irregular patterns of precipitation and snowmelt, and changing biological systems present challenges to the viability of these traditional livelihood portfolios in general, we find that climate change is also undermining local communities' livelihood assets in gender-specific ways. In this paper, we present a case study from the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (Uttarakhand, India) that both outlines the implications of climate change for women farmers in the area and highlights the potential for ecotourism (as a form of livelihood diversification) to strengthen both key livelihood assets of women and local communities' adaptive capacity more broadly. The paper intentionally employs a categorical focus on women but also addresses issues of inter-group and gender diversity. With this special issue in mind, suggestions for related research are proposed for consideration by climate scientists and social systems and/or policy modelers seeking to support gender justice through socially transformative perspectives and frameworks	['SDG05']
10.1177/1350506815571142	The economic case for gender equality in the European Union: Selling gender equality to decision-makers and neoliberalism to women’s organizations	Scholarship on gender and the European Union (EU) has consistently pointed out that EU gender equality policies have always been embedded in the logic of the market and that the economic framing has had negative impacts on the content and concepts of these policies. This article provides novel insights into this discussion by combining a discursive approach focused on framings with insights of feminist economists and examining how the relationship between gender equality and the economy has been conceptualized in EU policy documents from the 1980s up until the present day. The article identifies the key actors and processes behind the escalation of economic arguments for gender equality and makes visible the economic assumptions that underpin EU gender equality policy. It argues that in recent years the European institutions have intentionally developed and propagated a market-oriented gender equality discourse, the economic case for gender equality, which highlights the macroeconomic benefits of gender equality. The economic case reaffirms the gender-biased assumptions of neoclassical economic theory and legitimizes the EU’s current economic priorities and policies, many of which are detrimental to gender equality. The European Commission represents the argument that gender equality contributes to economic growth as an innovative way to promote gender equality. However, the economic case represents a risk for gender equality advocates, because it may tame the emerging feminist criticism of the EU’s economic policies and governance. </jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1177/0260107915583740	Sexual violence: A model of occupational choice and gender wage gap	Surge in sexual violence in India is a public concern in the recent times. I present the stylized facts regarding rapes in India over time and contrast them to the global data. Incidence of rape is positively associated with per capita income of a country and to female participation in the labour force. The documented empirical facts may not be representative of the reality because of many unreported incidences. Even though, we accept the empirical facts on their face value, these facts may not represent general rise in crime levels but a shift in occupational choice for women who are increasingly into non-traditional roles. I build a theoretical model where a woman has the choice to work in non-traditional sector as opposed to a traditional one. The model predicts that the gender gap in wages will reduce with technological progress but the sexual assault will register a rise. This will result in intensification in public demand for infrastructure that makes woman safe in their non-traditional role.  JEL: J16, J62, O33 </jats:p	['SDG05']

Sociodemographic and behavioural data derived from HIV risk and follow-up cohorts including MSM and FSW in coastal Kenya between 2005 and 2014 was used to estimate the risk of rape, physical assault and verbal abuse, and to assess associations between first occurrence of assault with individual and recent behavioural factors. Incidence of first reported rape was similar for MSM [3.9, confidence interval (CI) 3.1-5.0 per 100 person-years (pyrs)] and FSW (4.8 CI 3.5-6.4 per 100 pyrs), P = 0.22. Incidence of first reported physical and verbal assault was higher for FSW than MSM (21.1 versus 12.9 per 100 pyrs, P = 0.14 and 51.3 versus 30.9 per 100 pyrs, P = 0.03 respectively). Recent alcohol use was associated with reporting of all forms of assault by MSM [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.8, CI 0.9-3.5] and FSW (AOR 4.4, CI 1.41-14.0), as was recent sale of sex for MSM (AOR 2.0, CI 1.1-3.8). Exclusive sex with men, active sex work, and group sex were also specifically associated with reporting rape for MSM. Perpetrators of sexual and verbal assault were usually unknown, whilst perpetrators of physical violence toward FSW were usually regular sexual partners. MSM and FSW experienced a similarly high incidence of sexual assault in coastal Kenya, in addition to physical and verbal assault. Current national policies focus heavily on gender-based violence against women and young girls, but need to be inclusive of MSM and FS	['SDG05']

The impact on the couple relationship is described under the themes of feeling love and receiving love. Changes led three of the participants to experience their partner as having been replaced by a new person; they actively disliked this new person; they felt unable to love the new person in the same way as the old person; and their love was defined in terms of a caring relationship, rather than a spousal relationship.Conclusions: The study provides insight into why social, emotional and behavioural changes might be so consistently associated with reduced emotional wellbeing and lower levels of relationship quality and satisfaction.</jats:p	['SDG05']

A qualitative study exploring barriers to use of footwear among rural community members in northern Ethiopia	OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of personal, cultural and socioeconomic factors related to footwear use and non-use in northern Ethiopia. DESIGN: A qualitative study was conducted using focus group discussions and in-depth individual interviews. Data were collected using semistructured interview guides. SETTING: The study was conducted in East and West Gojjam Zones, Amhara region, northwest Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 91 individuals from 4 target groups participated in individual and group interviews: (1) non-affected community leaders including Idir (a form of social insurance) leaders, school principals, kebele (the lowest administrative unit) officials, health professionals, teachers, merchants and religious leaders; (2) affected men and women; (3) non-affected men and women not in leadership positions; and (4) school children (both male and female). RESULTS: Participants perceived a range of health benefits from donning footwear, including protection against injury and cold. Various types of shoes are available within the community, and their use varied depending on the nature of activities and the season. Personal and socioeconomic barriers hindered the desire to consistently use footwear. Widely established barefoot traditions and beliefs that footwear is uncomfortable, heavy and may weaken the feet have made the regular use of footwear uncommon. Economic constraints were also mentioned as hindering ownership and use of footwear. Distance from places where shoes could be bought also contributed to limited access. Cultural influences promoting gender inequality resulted in women being least able to access shoes. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several individual, cultural and socioeconomic barriers that influence individuals’ decisions about and use of footwear in rural northern Ethiopia. Promoting education on the health benefits of footwear, curbing podoconiosis-related misconceptions and integrating these with economic empowerment programmes, may all improve the use of footwear	['SDG05']

En este contexto, este artículo busca indagar cuáles son y cómo operan las tensiones generadas por el cambio de un enfoque materno-infantil hacia otro centrado en la salud y los derechos sexuales y reproductivos. A través de entrevistas semiestructuradas y grupos focales, se analizan las prácticas de los/as profesionales y sus esquemas de percepción y apreciaciones, en la atención a mujeres en situación de embarazo no deseado y aborto en los servicios del Sistema Nacional Integrado de Salud (SNIS) en Montevideo.

I examine newspaper stories published in two widely circulated newspapers, The Times of India and Dainik Jagran from 17 December to 31 December, two days after the victim died of the injuries incurred during the rape on 16 December. Studies have shown that English or regional language newspapers in India do not give fair treatment in terms of coverage of incidents related to violence against women. This story, however, was different. I provide a critical discourse analysis of news reports, editorials, and comments on this episode to show that the social construction of violence against women, ideological prisms of the reporters, socio-cultural contexts of the media reports, and neoliberal subjectivity that was shaken by this episode played into the newspapers’ treatment of this news.</jats:p	['SDG05']

Secondary data analysis was conducted using a sample of 572 women with histories of abuse and homelessness who were interviewed at shelters in the state of Florida. Findings from nested linear regressions demonstrate that relocation affects formal help-seeking while recentness to an area affects informal help-seeking. Access to personal resources also predicts women’s use of both informal and formal resources. Implications for intimate partner violence help-seeking are discussed. </jats:p	['SDG05']
10.1093/jicj/mqv071	Slavery prosecutions in international criminal jurisdictions	This article explores how the findings of international criminal tribunals (ICTs) in respect of enslavement as a form of system criminality can be translated for a proper assessment of slavery outside (armed) conflict. The author has found that, while ICTs are jurisdictionally limited to addressing only forms of institutionalized slavery, they have exceeded this restricted understanding of the practice. They have acknowledged that enslavement need not be officially endorsed at all and they have developed parameters for the identification of the actus reus of enslavement that bear relevance for the assessment of the commission of this crime by private individuals beyond the context of armed conflict or widespread repression. A second important contribution of ICTs to notions of enslavement is the differentiation between slavery and related crimes, such as forced marriage. ICTs have indirectly contributed to the law enforcement with respect to enslavement and slavery by expanding and elucidating these concepts. Moreover, the refined differentiations serve the goal of norm expression	['SDG05']

10.1108/ijge-10-2014-0040	Mixed-gender ownership and financial performance of SMEs in South Africa: A multidisciplinary analysis	PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the presence of women among owner-stakeholders affects firms’ financial performance. Particularly, it extends the corporate governance literature by linking stakeholder theory and gender differences to explain why gender composition of ownership matters for firms’ performance. As the management of small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) revolves around owner-managers and their individual characteristics that are likely to affect their achievements, the study further investigates the relationship between the gender composition of ownership and the firm survival.Design/methodology/approachUsing survey data on SMEs for 2007 and 2010, this study uses a panel-level heteroskedasticity technique and a probit methodology to assess the effect women’s presence among owners may exert on SMEs performance and survival, respectively.FindingsResults indicate that firms jointly owned by men and women appear to perform better than those owned by men although the presence of women among owners does not correlate with firm survival.Research limitations/implicationsWhile the findings of this study shed some light on the performance impact of gender composition of firm ownership, reports based on the presence of women among owners may not present the full picture. Whether the ownership is shared equally between different genders might provide further insides on the magnitude and/or robustness of such effect. Moreover, a small sample period (T = 2) was used to analyse a single industrial sector (manufacturing), and even though the Hausman test confirmed the use of random-effects specification, caution should be taken when generalizing the findings to other cases.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest that the leadership in mixed-gender context propels a perspective of women as a valuable resource within SMEs, but relying on it to sustain the survival would be unwise.Social implicationsSouth Africa scores particularly high on positive actions towards women entrepreneurship, and this is compounded in the SMEs sector by managerial attitudes that could offer positive developments for women.Originality/valueThe positive and significant relationship between women’s presence among owners and SMEs financial performance in South Africa complements the almost exclusively reported negative impact of gender diversity on firm performance. Consequently, mixed-gender owners’ team can be used as a fulcrum to promote SMEs growth in South Africa.</jats:sec	['SDG05']
10.1108/pm-09-2015-0049	Deconstructing the glass ceiling: gender equality in the Australian property profession	Purpose                 – The purpose of this paper is to export the role of professional bodies within the property industry in Australia in bringing about gender equality. In particular the policy objectives of the various professional bodies is analysed and contrasted with the level of genres equality demonstrated within the governance structures of the organisations at national and regional level.                                           Design/methodology/approach                 – The paper analyses the annual reports of the leading property professional bodies in Australia to identify any gender equity policy objectives and to identify the balance between male and female representation in the governing boards of the associations.                                           Findings                 – The research shows that while a few organisations have made some statements regarding the need for change to a more inclusive property industry these objectives are not reflected within the governance structure of the organisations. It is therefore evident that significant attitudinal and structural change will be required to bring about equality within the property industry.                                           Research limitations/implications                 – The research is limited to the Australian property and construction industry and the relevant boards at national and state level.                                           Practical implications                 – The paper highlights the need to address gender inequality at the senior management level within the professional associations that govern the property profession. The professional associations are uniquely placed to show leadership in promoting gender equality and should be adopting policy within the organisations charter to being about a shift in attitudes to women within management roles in the property industry.                                           Social implications                 – The issue of gender equity is highly topical and this paper adds to the research in this area. It highlights the important role that professional associations could take in bringing about change, but reveals that many professional bodies have a worse gender balance at the governance level than many of their member firms.                                           Originality/value                 – The paper is the first to analyse the gender mix within the professional bodies in Australia which govern and advise the property and construction industries. As such it reveals that little progress has been made in bringing about gender equality in the profession.             </jats:sec	['SDG05']

10.1177/0888325416630959	Seeking justice for wartime sexual violence in Kosovo: Voices and silence of women	At different times, and for different reasons, Kosovo informal and organized women’s networks have dealt with wartime sexual violence in different ways: they have followed either a strategy of silence or one of speech. Throughout, they have struggled to disentangle gender from ethnicity, straddling the line between a deep connection with local culture and domestic and international norms and agendas. This article tells their story, which in broader terms is the story of the subjectivity of women’s rights activists—domestic and international—as it connects with the normative framework of transitional justice. The case of Kosovo shows that transitional justice meaningfully engages local actors as a human rights project sensitive to political change, more than as a “toolkit” which packages truth, reconciliation and justice with recipes for implementation. The case of Kosovo also confirms that lobbying by women’s networks is crucial to the inclusion of women’s perspectives in transitional justice, and that the exclusion of women from decision making results in a net loss for women’s concerns. I would take the argument even further, and suggest that the inclusion of women and their agendas, as well as the struggle by women’s networks for inclusion, is necessary for human rights transformation. </jats:p	['SDG05']
10.5465/amle.2014.0139	Taking off the blinders: A comparative study of university students' changing perceptions of gender discrimination in the workplace from 2006 to 2013	As evidenced by recent legislation and various forms of media attention, eradicating gender inequity in the workforce is of significant importance today. However, this interest in justice stands in bold contrast to the continued gender wage gap, the steady number of gender discrimination suits filed each year, and the plethora of high-profile cases exposed in the media. Previous data collected in 2006 suggests that the very group readying to enter the workforce does not perceive gender discrimination as a threat of major significance to themselves or others. University students tend to minimize or even disregard the likelihood that they will witness or experience gender bias or discrimination in their careers. Our work here serves as a continuation of and a comparison to the 2006 study, with the goal of determining whether the perspective of university students has shifted, or whether they continue to consider themselves immune to the injustice of gender discrimination at work. Our findings suggest that students in this cohort are not only more aware of these issues, but that this awareness has expanded to include increased concern over gender discrimination against men as well. However, the reluctance of students to believe that they personally will be affected by gender discrimination has been and continues to be surprisingly high	['SDG05']

Our aim was to explore the experiences and perspectives of IPV victims regarding their eating behaviors and their attitudes toward and use of food. We conducted focus groups and individual interviews with 25 IPV victims identified at a domestic violence agency and asked them about their eating behaviors and how, if at all, these behaviors related to their experience of IPV. Qualitative analysis of the transcribed encounters identified themes explicating the relationship between their eating behaviors and experiences of IPV. All women described altered eating behaviors related to IPV that were categorized into several major themes: (a) somatization (victims experience significant somatic symptoms as a result of abuse); (b) avoiding abuse (victims modify their eating behaviors to avoid abuse); (c) coping (victims use food to handle the psychological effects of abuse); (d) self-harm (victims use food to hurt themselves as a reaction to the abuse); and (e) challenging abusive partners (victims use their eating behaviors to retaliate against their abusers). IPV can provoke altered eating behaviors in victims that may be harmful, comforting, or a source of strength in their abusive relationships. Understanding the complex relationship between IPV and victims’ altered eating behaviors is important in promoting healthy eating among victims. </jats:p	['SDG05']

In this article, my central argument is that framing the combination of work and care as a matter of personal choice stands in the way of economically empowering women. To promote sustainability in combining career and care, we need to expose, challenge and bend underlying norms about gender roles. For policymakers to take responsibility in  the economic empowerment of women, both policy documents and media coverage should promote  win–win instead of zero sum solutions in combining work and care, for both men and women	['SDG05']

The purpose of this paper is to present the assessment and treatment of an adult male offender with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The client’s offence involved intimate partner violence and was committed at a time of acute psychiatric relapse.   Design/methodology/approach In total, 12 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy and CAT informed treatment were individually designed to meet the needs of the client, delivered in an in-patient setting in the UK. The client’s progress was assessed using psychometric, observational, and narrative/descriptive methods.   Findings Psychometric evidence was limited by distorted responding. However, narrative/descriptive assessment indicated that progress had been made in some areas. Recommendations for further treatment were made.   Practical implications In total, 12 sessions did not meet all of the client’s needs. The use of CAT as a model that his team could use in understanding his violence was conducive to risk management. Overall, insight gained through CAT-based psychological intervention contributed to risk reduction.   Originality/value This case study demonstrates the applicability of CAT to forensic settings. </jats:sec	['SDG05']

Faced with numerous options, sometimes contradictory advice from experienced scholars and a desire to find the perfect match for a research question, one can find the decision to opt for a particular methodological path a huge step, and it can be hindered by nagging concerns and a lack of academic experience. This article draws together two short pieces of writing from PhD students at Lancaster University, who attended and were inspired by a workshop on narrative methods, led by Professor Catherine Kohler Riessman.  The first piece is a reflective account of why the author was drawn to narrative methods for her research. It explores the impact of charities and how this is articulated qualitatively, within the context of a mixed market approach to welfare and health service provision in the UK. It discusses what she observes to be the parallels between a narrative research approach and her practice as a social worker and details her experience of completing her first narrative interview. The second is about how the author was inspired by the workshop to produce a pilot study on attitudes of male offenders towards violence against women using the narrative approach and including excerpts from his research data. Finally, it draws together their thoughts about the workshop and how they intend to continue working with narratives in their future. </jats:p	['SDG05']

Using a convenience sampling method, we collected data from 730 college students (580 general students and 150 student-athletes)  at 4 South Korean universities. We found significant differences between subgroups divided by gender and student status (general students and student-athletes). Female students were more concerned than male students were with the process of creating gender equality and the goal of a diverse  organizational culture. Student-athletes were more likely than general students were to consider that athletic departments should focus more on performance goals (e.g., winning) and processes (e.g., attracting athletes) than on athlete well-being. Our findings provide useful information for  South Korean athletic administrators to help develop goals and processes that meet the priorities of the key stakeholder group of students.</jats:p	['SDG05']

Young women who had experienced sexual violence (ever) were 2.5 times more likely not to have used any modern contraceptives in the 12 months preceding the survey. They were also 2.3 times more likely to report that their last pregnancy was unplanned. Higher odds of not being able to negotiate contraceptive use with their partners were only reported by young women having experienced sexual violence in the 12 months prior to the survey when adjusted for confounders.; Sexual violence was found to be significantly associated with contraceptive negotiation and use as well as unplanned pregnancy. Weak perceived ability to negotiate contraceptive use highlights gender inequalities leaving young women vulnerable to unprotected sex and thus unplanned pregnancies	['SDG05']

Attrition from athletic training for our participants was triggered by organizational, individual, and sociocultural factors. These can be broken down to four main themes of family values, work-life imbalance, sexism, and financial concerns.</jats:p	['SDG05']
10.1177/0886260515591975	Looking for Blame: Rape Myth Acceptance and Attention to Victim and Perpetrator	In two studies, the authors examined the influence of rape myth acceptance (RMA) on participants’ attention toward the potential victim versus perpetrator in a rape case. In Study 1 ( N = 90), participants selected information that focused on either the male defendant or the female victim. With increasing RMA, participants preferred information that focused on the victim rather than the defendant. In Study 2 ( N = 41), participants viewed photographs depicting both victim and defendant while their eye movements were recorded. With increasing RMA, participants spent less time inspecting the defendant relative to the victim. In both studies, higher RMA predicted stronger anti-victim and pro-defendant judgments, replicating previous research. Taken together, these results support the assumption that RMA guides participants’ attention, leading to a focus on the alleged rape victim and away from the alleged perpetrator. Implications of the current research and future directions are discussed. </jats:p	['SDG05']

Since passing the Law on Foreign Investment in December 1987, there has been a continuous flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country, mostly through the establishment of manufacturing plants by MNCs (Le 1997; Tran 1997). In the space of three decades, foreign investment has become a major and growing factor in the country\u27s economy, particularly in the industrial component and in exports. By June 2011, Vietnam had received commitments of US$198,889,098,224 for 12,776 projects from 92 countries and territories (MPI 2012) and as of December 2004, foreign-invested firms had created 1,044,851 jobs (GSO 2005: 121). Indirectly FDI has also provided employment through subcontractors and suppliers. Despite its relatively short history of development, Vietnam has been quite successful in attracting FDI compared to its neighbour countries. It ranks third among the investment recipients in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (Mirza and Giroud 2004)	['SDG05']

10.1177/1350506815625906	Gender equality and religion: A multi-faith exploration of young adults’ narratives	This paper presents findings from research on young adults in the UK from diverse religious backgrounds. Utilizing questionnaires, interviews, and video diaries it assesses how religious young adults understood and managed the tensions in popular discourse between gender equality as an enshrined value and aspirational narrative, and religion as purportedly instituting gender inequality. We show that, despite varied understandings, and the ambivalence and tension in managing ideal and practice, participants of different religious traditions and genders were committed to gender equality. Thus, they viewed gender-unequal practices within their religious cultures as an aberration from the essence of religion. In this way, they firmly rejected the dominant discourse that religion is inherently antithetical to gender equality	['SDG05']
10.1177/0361684317705086	Gender-Based Violence and Armed Conflict: A Community-Informed Socioecological Conceptual Model From Northeastern Uganda	The high prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) in armed conflict has been documented in various national contexts, but less is known about the complex pathways that constitute the relation between the two. Employing a community-based collaborative approach, we constructed a community-informed socioecological conceptual model from a feminist perspective, detailing how armed conflict relates to GBV in a conflict-affected rural community in Northeastern Uganda. The research questions were as follows: (1) How does the community conceptualize GBV? and (2) How does armed conflict relate to GBV? Nine focus group discussions divided by gender, age, and profession and six key informant interviews were conducted. Participants’ ages ranged from 9 to 80 years ( n = 34 girls/women, n = 43 boys/men). Grounded theory was used in analysis. Participants conceptualized eight forms of and 22 interactive variables that contributed to GBV. Armed conflict affected physical violence/quarreling, sexual violence, early marriage, and land grabbing via a direct pathway and four indirect pathways initiated through looting of resources, militarization of the community, death of a parent(s) or husband, and sexual violence. The findings suggest that community, organizational, and policy-level interventions, which include attention to intersecting vulnerabilities for exposure to GBV in conflict-affected settings, should be prioritized. While tertiary psychological interventions with women and girls affected by GBV in these areas should not be eliminated, we suggest that policy makers and members of community and organizational efforts make systemic and structural changes.

Samtidigt är det socialtjänsten som är ansvarig för att ge stöd till misshandlade kvinnor enligt tilläggen i socialtjänstlagen (2001). I den här artikeln undersöks våldsutsatta kvinnors egna erfarenheter av stöd i samband med polisutredningar om våld i nära relationer. Studien är kvalitativ och baseras på intervjuer med sex kvinnor som har fått stöd från Relationsvåldscentrum (RVC). De huvudsakliga resultaten i artikeln visar att stöd i samband med rättsprocessen är viktigt. Kvinnors tidigare erfarenheter eller uppfattningar om socialtjänsten kan hindra dem från att ta hjälp från eller vända sig till socialtjänsten för stöd.Social workers and social work have been criticized for failing to address violence against women in adequate ways, of blaming the victim and failing to recognize domestic violence as a problem. At the same time, it is the social services that are responsible for support to abused women, according to amendments in the Social Services Act (2001). This article examines abused women’s own experiences of support in connection with the police investigation of domestic violence. It is a qualitative study with six women who all have received support from the Relationship Violence Center (RVC) in Stockholm. The main findings in the article suggest that support in connection with the judicial process is important. Women’s earlier experiences or preconceptions of the social services might prevent them from accepting support or turning to the social services for help	['SDG05']

Questioning the social role of media, its economic structure and regulatory framework, introduced issues, perspectives and knowledge which had up to then been the exclusive domain of the communication and culture fields. These debates took place simultaneously with the advances in issues related to sexual rights and gender, which materialized in laws (Equal Marriage Law ,Violence against Women Law, Gender Identity Law, to only mention a few) and introduced the discussion on the role of mass media in the reproduction of discriminatory cultural patterns and the exercise of symbolic violence against women. From the analysis of current legislation, this paper attempts to explore the potentialities and limitations of its implementation and media theories that support it. Also, the centrality of “media text” - as object of analysis, as object of complaint and as object of regulation – inasmuch as this new role is in tension with the consensus on the cultural study of audiovisual media.Fil: Justo Von Lurzer, María Carolina.

10.1186/s40359-017-0202-3	Consequences of child emotional abuse, emotional neglect and exposure to intimate partner violence for eating disorders: A systematic critical review	Abstract Background Child maltreatment and eating disorders are significant public health problems. Yet, to date, research has focused on the role of child physical and sexual abuse in eating-related pathology. This is despite the fact that globally, exposure to emotional abuse, emotional neglect and intimate partner violence are the three of the most common forms of child maltreatment. The objective of the present study is to systematically identify and critically review the literature examining the association between child emotional abuse (EA), emotional neglect (EN), and exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and adult eating-disordered behavior and eating disorders. Methods A systematic search was conducted of five electronic databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ERIC up to October 2015 to identify original research studies that investigated the association between EA, EN and children’s exposure to IPV, with adult eating disorders or eating-disordered behavior using a quantitative research design. Database searches were complemented with forward and backward citation chaining. Studies were critically appraised using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Results A total of 5556 publications were screened for this review resulting in twenty-three articles included in the present synthesis. These studies focused predominantly on EA and EN, with a minority examining the role of child exposure to IPV in adult eating-related pathology. Prevalence of EA and EN ranged from 21.0% to 66.0%, respectively. No prevalence information was provided in relation to child exposure to IPV. Samples included predominantly White women. The methodological quality of the available literature is generally low. Currently, the available literature precludes the possibility of determining the extent to which EA, EN or child exposure to IPV have independent explanatory influence in adult eating-related pathology above what has been identified for physical and sexual abuse. Conclusions While a large proportion of adults with eating disorders or eating-disordered behavior report EA, EN, or child exposure to IPV , there is a paucity of high-quality evidence about these relationships	['SDG05']

Methods In-person interviews collected information regarding history of childhood abuse and IPV from 2,928 women aged 18-49 years old prior to 16 weeks of gestation. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Compared to women with no childhood abuse, the odds of PTSD were increased 4.31-fold for those who reported physical abuse only (95% CI, 2.18–8.49), 5.33-fold for sexual abuse only (95% CI, 2.38–11.98), and 8.03-fold for those who reported physical and sexual abuse (95% CI, 4.10–15.74). Mediation analysis showed 13% of the childhood abuse-PTSD association was mediated by IPV. Furthermore, high odds of PTSD were noted among women with histories of childhood abuse and IPV compared with women who were not exposed to either (OR = 20.20; 95% CI, 8.18–49.85). Conclusions Childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of PTSD during early pregnancy. The odds of PTSD were particularly elevated among women with a history of childhood abuse and IPV. Efforts should be made to prevent childhood abuse and mitigate its effects on women's mental health.Revisión por pare	['SDG05']

The current qualitative study explored the role of gender in shaping the social context, meaning, and reception of young women’s IPV in the United States. A total of 36 undergraduate women were recruited from a larger sample for in-depth interviews. Emergent themes suggest that women’s violence was construed as nonequivalent to men’s violence, including the perceived triviality of women’s violence, contingencies under which women’s violence is deemed acceptable, and the status of male IPV as unacceptable. Gender was important for participants and bystanders in determining whether they interpreted behaviors as meaningful acts of violence. </jats:p	['SDG05']

Over the past 17 years, the country has taken several initiatives to promote gender equality nationally, and today gender equality norms cut across Mexican priorities in foreign policy and South-South cooperation activities. Paradoxically, the gains achieved at policy formulating tables have been accompanied by a rise in gender-based violence. To approach this paradox, this article engages with gender equality norms to show how they have been introduced, developed and transformed in the context of a national security crisis and extreme violence directed at women. The analysis points to the important role of Mexican feminists and anti-feminicide activists in the promotion of gender equality norms, as well as to the existence of a political landscape in which structural inequality persists and such norms remain highly contested.</jats:p	['SDG05']

Community college (CC) students make up 45% of American undergraduates, but little is known about their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV), or accompanying service use and needs.  Method. The current study used a sequential confirmatory mixed methods design among a simple random sample of female CC students (n=435), of whom 112 have experienced IPV in the past 12 months. Of these IPV survivors, 20 participated in qualitative follow-up interviews.   The study assess use and perceived usefulness of college and community based resources, extent of social support, and perceived need for and barriers to service access.  Results. Campus based resources were rated as more useful than community based resources.  Faculty were identified as  important supports for survivors.  Those experiencing IPV reported lower rates of social support compared to other students. A range of supports and services were endorsed as possibly useful by survivors. Conclusions. Survivors need services to address life generated risks that compound barriers to college completion created by abuse.  CC survivors often balance work and parenting with education, and may benefit from different services than survivors in other educational settings.

Polygyny practices in PNG have come under increasing domestic attention in recent years, especially as pertains to reinforcing patriarchy and exacerbating gender inequality. Based on qualitative research with women, we identify a new emerging polygyny' that is located in women's and girls' choices, decisions, experiences and actions, and which contrasts with other research documenting polygyny from men's perspectives. Narratives from female participants described young women and girls who actively seek polygynous relationships with men who have disposable income and other assets, with the aim of gaining access to economic wealth as co-wives. In the context of public and legal debate about the status of polygyny in PNG, these findings illustrate the need for a more balanced discussion about polygynous relationships, located within an understanding of women's lived experiences	['SDG05']

Based on life-history narratives of 57 women in India and 21 practitioner interviews, this paper documents a growing phenomenon whereby men who are resident in another country abuse their Indian-origin wives, appropriate their dowry and abandon them. While dowry-related abuse in such marriages is part of a continuum of domestic violence prevalent in South Asia and the South Asian diaspora, we explore how gender and migration intersect to exacerbate existing forms of violence against women and foster new forms of violence such as transnational abandonment. Gender-blind transnational formal-legal frameworks and gendered and transnational structural inequalities come together to construct transnational brides as ‘disposable women’ who can be abused, exploited and cast aside with impunity	['SDG05']

This book explores how a variety of actors translated this movement into practice on four islands (Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados, and Bermuda) from the 1930s–70s. The process of decolonization during this period led to heightened clashes over imperial and national policy and brought local class, race, and gender tensions to the surface, making debates over reproductive practices particularly evocative and illustrative of broader debates in the history of decolonization and international family planning. Birth Control in the Decolonizing Caribbean is at once a political history, a history of activism, and a social history, exploring the challenges faced by working class women as they tried to negotiate control over their reproductive lives.</jats:p	['SDG05']

Empirical and comparative examinations of the perceptions of why women stay in physically abusive relationships are lacking. Answering this question calls for comprehensive, methodologically rigorous research. Using survey data collected from approximately 1,000 college students from two Chinese and two U.S. universities, this study empirically compared and contrasted factors that impact U.S. and Chinese students’ perceptions as to why women remain in physically abusive relationships. Utilizing a theoretical framework of social constructionism, two common reasons were assessed: Women stay in physically abusive relationships because of learned helplessness and positive beliefs in the relationship/hope for the future. The results show that viewing IPV as a crime, gender, and beliefs of the causes of IPV were robust predictors of college students’ perceptions toward why women stay in physically abusive relationships. U.S. college students were more likely to express sympathy and understanding toward why women remain in abusive relationships than Chinese students. Directions for future research and policy implications were discussed. </jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1177/0791603517735772	Making the invisible visible: Masculinities and men’s illicit recreational drug use	This paper highlights a significant gender disparity within Ireland’s illicit drug landscape, which is predominantly composed of men. Irish men’s historical gender invisibility contributed to their predominance as drug users being overlooked. Thus, this paper focuses a masculinities lens on Irish men’s recreational use of illicit drugs, making their drug taking visible as a gendered activity. The study utilised a qualitative methodology, with masculinities theory forming the primary theoretical and analytical lens. Nine focus groups were conducted with Irish men exploring their views on illicit drugs. Twenty in-depth interviews were completed with men who identified as illicit recreational drug users, exploring their drug-taking histories and experiences. Findings demonstrate how the use of illicit drugs can symbolically communicate messages about the drug taker. The study reveals masculinities are an interpretative lens employed by men when trying to understand their own or other men’s drug taking. It is argued that men’s drug taking and masculinities intersect. In homosocial contexts, men’s recreational use of illicit drugs can contribute to them demonstrating masculinities to other drug-taking men; however, outside of these contexts, the same behaviours can be viewed by non-drug takers as emasculating. </jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1177/0886260518778258	The Challenges of Working With Men Who Perpetrate Partner Violence: Perspectives and Observations of Experts Who Work With Batterer Intervention Programs	Batterer intervention programs (BIPs) constitute the primary treatment for perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV). Systematic evaluations of BIPs, however, have yielded modest results in terms of these programs’ ability to reduce perpetration. Descriptive studies, which can provide information on the contexts and process associated with BIPs, can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms that might promote change among BIP clients, and as such are important to improving efficacy measures for BIPs. To date, however, limited research exists on what challenges BIPs encounter in working with clients, and how those challenges present barriers to behavioral change among perpetrators at the intervention level. As part of a 2-year ethnographic study, we conducted 36 individual semistructured interviews with professionals working with BIPs. We identified six themes related to challenges to promoting behavioral change among men who perpetrate violence: (a) social acceptance of IPV, (b) hypermasculine attitudes, (c) emotional problems, (d) childhood exposure to violence, (e) co-morbid mental health issues, and (f) denial, minimization, and blame. Our results have implications for thinking about some of the contextual factors that may impede BIPs ability to produce desired outcomes and for identifying areas in which programs can be tailored to improve the overall client experience. Our results also point to the need for a more coordinated community response to IPV, and in particular to helping provide resources that support BIPs sustained, safe, and as effective as possible work. </jats:p	['SDG05']

RESULTS: The main challenges are the intersectoral, participatory, and integral approach (with emphasis on mental health and sexual and reproductive health), ensured accessibility to health services, the need for a reliable registration and information system of the population displaced by violence and its characteristics, and the addressing of the biopsychosocial problems of the different groups, especially women, persons with disabilities or infectious diseases, adolescents, children, ethnic minorities, older adults and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and intersexual population. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of political will to accept and see the internal displacement by violence and its importance as a humanitarian and public health problem is an obstacle to the adequate and timely care of the population displaced by violence in Mexico.</jats:p	['SDG05']

10.1177/1524838016668589	Nonfatal Gun Use in Intimate Partner Violence: A Systematic Review of the Literature	Guns figure prominently in the homicide of women by an intimate partner. Less is known, however, about their non-fatal use against an intimate partner. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched eight electronic databases and identified 10 original research articles that reported the prevalence of the non-fatal use of firearms against an intimate partner. Results indicate that: 1) There is relatively little research on the subject of intimate partners’ non-fatal gun use against women. 2) The number of U.S. women alive today who have had an intimate partner use a gun against them is substantial: About 4.5 million have had an intimate partner threaten them with a gun and nearly one million have been shot or shot at by an intimate partner. Whether non-fatal gun use is limited to the extreme form of abuse (battering) or whether it occurs in the context of situational violence remains to be seen. Regardless, when it comes to the likely psychological impact, it may be a distinction without a difference; because guns can be lethal quickly and with relatively little effort, displaying or threatening with a gun can create a context known as coercive control, which facilitates chronic and escalating abuse. Implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed, all of which include expanding an implicit focus on homicide to include an intimate partner’s non-fatal use of a gun	['SDG05']
10.1108/jcrpp-01-2018-0008	Intimate partner violence: gender issues and the adjudication of homicide and other cases	PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the role of gender in intimate partner violence (IPV) and, based upon the author’s experience as an expert witness, 25 years of clinical experience working with IPV perpetrators and victims, and a review of the relevant scholarly literature, provide judges, attorneys, mental health professionals and expert court witness suggestions for the adjudication of cases involving IPV in homicide and other cases.Design/methodology/approachThe author reviewed the extant general domestic violence research literature, depending largely on results from findings from the Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project, a series of 17 literature review published in five issues of the peer-reviewed journal, Partner Ause. Other relevant research articles were found via a search of the PschInfo database, using the keywords “intimate partner homicides,” “domestic violence homicides,” “intimate partner homicides and gender” and “domestic violence homicides and gender.”FindingsThe judicial response to IPV perpetration has been limited by common misconceptions, among them the confusion between most forms of IPV, which are primarily bi-directional and less consequential and battering, which involves more serious assaults and is typically motivated out of a desire to dominate and control one’s partner. Another misconception is that women are much more likely than men to perpetrate IPV in self-defense or to express emotion. On the other hand, there is no question that female victims are much more likely to experience severe physical injuries, and that women account for approximately three-quarters of homicide victims.Practical implicationsThese include the following: this concise review of IPV research provides a clearer understanding of IPV, useful for anyone working in the field. Mental health professionals working with IPV perpetrators, as well as victims, can draw from this research best practice suggestions in working with more problematic cases. The paper should be especially useful to anyone involved in the adjudication of IPV cases, including lethal cases. In particular, prosecutors and attorneys working for the defense are given suggestions on how to obtain more reliable research data, choose more fruitful questions for their clients, and better conceptualize a case overall.Originality/valueThis paper presents a more nuanced and evidence-based conceptualization of serious and lethal IPV, drawing on a broad research base not generally available to members of the legal profession.</jats:sec	['SDG05']

This study aims to identify survivors' perceptions of (a) contextual (i.e., community, and relationship) and individual-level risk and protective factors for HIV among African immigrant women in the United States and (b) areas and strategies of HIV prevention intervention at contextual and individual levels. Qualitative data for this study were collected from African-born women (n = 39) in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC, from February 2017 to March 2018. Seventeen in-depth interviews and five focus groups were conducted with African immigrant survivors of cumulative trauma. Results revealed HIV prevention intervention needs and risk and protective factors for HIV at the community (e.g., community education), relationship (e.g., intimate partner violence, family), and individual (e.g., women's empowerment) levels. These findings can inform the development of culturally tailored multilevel HIV prevention interventions for African immigrant women. </jats:p	['SDG05']

This paper aims to explore how managers interpret the information embedded in anonymised job applications and how they interpret the organisational priorities driving the adoption of anonymous recruitment.Design/methodology/approachSemi-structured interviews with 30 managers in two Australian public sector organisations were analysed.FindingsThe results showed that managers used implicit signals and cues to infer the gender identities of applicants in anonymised applications, reintroducing the possibility of bias. Managers perceived that anonymous recruitment sent positive external signals to prospective employees but were sceptical about its effectiveness.Research limitations/implicationsThe results showed that removing applicants’ names and identifying information from applications may not be sufficient to reduce bias. In organisations where managers are sympathetic to equity and diversity issues, use of anonymous recruitment may provoke resentment if managers perceive organisational distrust or inconsistent objectives. Limitations regarding the size and nature of the sample are acknowledged.Practical implicationsOrganisations seeking to reduce gender discrimination in recruitment may consider adopting standardised application procedures or training managers to understand how stereotypes affect evaluations. Organisations should also assess managerial support for, and understanding of, anonymous recruitment prior to implementation.Originality/valueThe findings add to existing knowledge regarding the effects of implicit gender signals in managers’ assessments and the effectiveness of anonymous recruitment in reducing gender bias. It also contributes to signalling theory by examining how managers interpret the signals conveyed in organisational policies.</jats:sec	['SDG05']

Biological oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen values were well above the permissible limit at all sites, and were recorded as being at maximum at Dinapur sewage treatment plant. Heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr) in disposed effluents were above permissible limits at all three sites. Likewise, the most probable number index of E. coli in water samples and coliform counts were recorded as being higher in irrigated water samples and vegetables, indicating a serious health hazard posed by intense microbial and faecal pollution. It was recommended that an integrated approach of phytoremediation with aquatic macrophytes and ozonization of wastewater be adopted to curb the heavy metals and microbial pollution based on these recent research investigations.</jats:p	['SDG06']
10.1002/hyp.7838	Geostatistics for assessing the efficiency of a distributed physically-based water quality model: Application to nitrate in the Seine River	International audienceThis article shows how geostatistics can be used to reduce distributed physically based model (DPBM) uncertainties when assessing nitrate concentrations along a 250-km stretch of the Seine River. First of all, co-kriging is used to build a set of boundary conditions (BCs) (inlet concentrations from major tributary rivers) consistent with validation data. It partially addresses the issues of errors in data used as model input and errors in data to be compared with model outputs. Then the analysis of temporal variograms (simple variograms of observed and simulated concentrations, and their cross-variogram) reveals a clear mismatch between simulated and observed values that was not detected by classical objective functions [root mean squared error (RMSE), etc.]. Variograms appear to include three components representing three different time scales: sub-weekly, monthly and annual scales. Mismatches between simulated and observed values are analysed as (i) wrong quantification of inputs to the river (especially during the rainy period: combined sewer overflow (CSO), waste water treatment plant (WWTP) and tributary contributions to the nitrate fluxes in the Seine River) and (ii) wrong description of physical processes within the river. Finally, the modelling of simple and cross-variograms appears to be a sensitive analysis tool which can be used to describe and reduce modelling uncertaintie	['SDG06']
10.2166/wst.2010.493	Effects of intermittent loading on nitrogen removal in horizontal subsurface flow wetlands	Removal of CBOD5 and nitrogen from septic tank effluent was evaluated in four horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) wetlands. An intermittently loaded cell was compared to a continuously loaded control cell, with both treatments receiving the same weekly volume. The intermittent cell was rapidly drained and “rested” for 24-hr, then refilled in steps, twice weekly. Two media with different particle sizes but similar porosities were also compared. The two media, light weight expanded shale and gravel, were both continuously loaded. As hypothesized, the wetland cell that was intermittently loaded had higher dissolved oxygen, greater ammonia removal, and greater nitrate production than the continuously loaded cells. Areal NH3-N removal for the intermittently loaded cell was 0.90 g m−2 d−1 compared to 0.47 g m−2 d−1 for the control. Ammonia removal was also higher in continuously loaded gravel cells than in cells with expanded shale. Ammonia-N removal was an order of magnitude lower in a similar SSF wetland that had been in operation for 3 years. However, CBOD5, total suspended solids, and total nitrogen did not vary substantially among the treatments.</jats:p	['SDG06']
10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02507.x	A comparison of spatially explicit landscape representation methods and their relationship to stream condition	1. Biodiversity, water quality and ecosystem processes in streams are known to be influenced by the terrestrial landscape over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Lumped attributes (i.e. per cent land use) are often used to characterise the condition of the catchment; however, they are not spatially explicit and do not account for the disproportionate influence of land located near the stream or connected by overland flow. \ud \ud 2. We compared seven landscape representation metrics to determine whether accounting for the spatial proximity and hydrological effects of land use can be used to account for additional variability in indicators of stream ecosystem health. The landscape metrics included the following: a lumped metric, four inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) metrics based on distance to the stream or survey site and two modified IDW metrics that also accounted for the level of hydrologic activity (HA-IDW). Ecosystem health data were obtained from the Ecological Health Monitoring Programme in Southeast Queensland, Australia and included measures of fish, invertebrates, physicochemistry and nutrients collected during two seasons over 4 years. Linear models were fitted to the stream indicators and landscape metrics, by season, and compared using an information-theoretic approach. \ud \ud 3. Although no single metric was most suitable for modelling all stream indicators, lumped metrics rarely performed as well as other metric types. Metrics based on proximity to the stream (IDW and HA-IDW) were more suitable for modelling fish indicators, while the HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the survey site generally outperformed others for invertebrates, irrespective of season. There was consistent support for metrics based on proximity to the survey site (IDW or HA-IDW) for all physicochemical indicators during the dry season, while a HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the stream was suitable for five of the six physicochemical indicators in the post-wet season. Only one nutrient indicator was tested and results showed that catchment area had a significant effect on the relationship between land use metrics and algal stable isotope ratios in both seasons. \ud \ud 4. Spatially explicit methods of landscape representation can clearly improve the predictive ability of many empirical models currently used to study the relationship between landscape, habitat and stream condition. A comparison of different metrics may provide clues about causal pathways and mechanistic processes behind correlative relationships and could be used to target restoration efforts strategically	['SDG06']

10.2174/1872212111105010045	Coastal reservoir by soft-dam and its possible applications	This paper introduces the patented technology of “soft-dam coastal reservoir”. Compared to the conventional technology of solid-dam coastal reservoir or long-distance water diversion, the patented technology is easier to implement with lower cost. As an example, the paper discusses the application of this technology in Murray-Darling River, Australia and Yellow River, China for water resources management. Both catchments are currently facing the similar problems of water shortage, degradation of water quality, and the threat of flood disaster. Both Australia and China have taken many measures to remediate the damaged ecosystems but none of them have been proven fully effective. In our proposal, the patented soft-dam coastal reservoir will be built at the river mouths to uphold the river runoff lost to the sea. The preliminary study shows that with the use of the coastal reservoirs, the river runoff and water supply in these two basins can be significantly increased and the water quality can also be improved. This is because 1) there exists an adequate amount of good quality water in these two river mouths, especially during the flood seasons; 2) it is technically and economically feasible to develop the storm water, relative to other methods such as long distance water diversion & transportation and seawater desalination; 3) the patented technology uses the natural resources in a sustainable and environmental friendly way to the ecosystem	['SDG06']
10.1002/eco.194	A general predictive model for estimating monthly ecosystem evapotranspiration	Accurately quantifying evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for modelling regional-scale ecosystem water balances. This study assembled an ET data set estimated from eddy flux and sapflow measurements for 13 ecosystems across a large climatic and management gradient from the United States, China, and Australia. Our objectives were to determine the relationships among monthly measured actual ET (ET), calculated FAO-56 grass reference ET (ETₒ), measured precipitation (P), and leaf area index (LAI)-one associated key parameter of ecosystem structure. Results showed that the growing season ET from wet forests was generally higher than ETₒ while those from grasslands or woodlands in the arid and semi-arid regions were lower than ETₒ. Second, growing season ET was found to be converged to within ± 10% of P for most of the ecosystems examined. Therefore, our study suggested that soil water storage in the nongrowing season was important in influencing ET and water yield during the growing season. Lastly, monthly LAI, P, and ETₒ together explained about 85% of the variability of monthly ET. We concluded that the three variables LAI, P, and ETₒ, which were increasingly available from remote sensing products and weather station networks, could be used for estimating monthly regional ET dynamics with a reasonable accuracy. Such an empirical model has the potential to project the effects of climate and land management on water resources and carbon sequestration when integrated with ecosystem models.11 page(s	['SDG06']

Due to the peculiarities of the small agglomerations, the treatment solutions used in medium and large cities usually do not give satisfactory results if they are implanted directly into those communities. It is therefore necessary to adapt these technologies to the small towns or to search for new treatment solutions. In this regard, R&amp;D activities play a key role. In fact, many research groups address their activities to the study of sanitation and treatment of small populations. In relation to the technologies studied there is a wide range that includes both extensive and intensive technologies. In the case of Spain, as in other countries, constructed wetlands seem to be the most studied technology in the recent years to sewage treatment in small settlements. However, there are still areas of study to be promoted in order to solve the current problems of sanitation and wastewater treatment in small settlements.</jats:p	['SDG06']

How this could be generated and maintained was less clear. This historical article describes development of protocols for evidence-based community mobilisation in five local administrative units (municipios) in the Mexican state of Guerrero between 1992 and 1995.                                   Methods             A sample of five to eight sentinel sites represented each of the most impoverished municipalities of the poorest five of the state's seven regions. A 1992 baseline survey of diarrhoea and its actionable determinants provided the substrate for discussion with local planners and communities. Municipal planners used different strategies to promote participation. In one municipality, new health committees took control of water quality. In another, municipal authorities hired health promoters; a song promoted oral rehydration, and house-to-house interpersonal discussions promoted chlorination. In the poorest and most mountainous municipality, radio casera (home-made radio) soap operas used local ""stars"". In the largest and most disparate municipality, a child-to-family scheme relied on primary and secondary school teachers. The research team assessed outcomes at intervals and used the results to reinforce local planning and action.                                   Results             Diarrhoea rates declined in all five municipalities, and there were several positive intermediate outcomes from the communication strategies – changing knowledge, household practices and uptake of services. There was a strong link between specific contents of the communication package and the changing knowledge or practices.                                   Conclusions             Apart from these evidence-based interventions, other factors probably contributed to the decline of childhood diarrhoea. But, by monitoring implementation of planning decisions and the impact this has at community level, micro-regional planning can stimulate and reinforce actions likely to improve the health of communities. The process empowered municipalities to get access to more resources from the state government and international agencies.           </jats:sec"	['SDG06']
10.2166/wst.2011.695	Quantification of dissolved methane in UASB reactors treating domestic wastewater under different operating conditions	This paper aimed at measuring the concentration of methane dissolved in effluents from different UASB reactors (pilot-, demo- and full-scale) treating domestic wastewater, in order to calculate the degree of saturation of such greenhouse gas and evaluate the losses of energetic potential in such systems. The results showed that methane saturation degrees, calculated according to Henry's law, varied from ∼1.4 to 1.7 in the different reactors, indicating that methane was oversaturated in the liquid phase. The overall results indicated that the losses of dissolved methane in the anaerobic effluents were considerably high, varying from 36 to 41% of total methane generated in the reactor. These results show that there is considerable uncontrolled loss of methane in anaerobic wastewater treatment plants, implying the need of research on technologies aimed at recovering such energetic greenhouse gas.</jats:p	['SDG06']

10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.528.71	Removing of nano-particles from semiconductor wastewater using a hybrid treatment system	Packaging process is one of the main manufacturing steps in the wafer fabrication industries. However, nano-particles would be produced during the packaging process. The produced nano-particle-contained wastewater has characteristics of dark color and high turbidity. Because the nano-particles would usually result in the clogging of the membrane filtration system when it is used for water treatment and reclamation, the application of a pre-treatment system is required to extend the membrane life. The objective of this study was to develop a pre-treatment system for packaging wastewater treatment before membrane system was applied for further water quality improvement. In this laboratory-scale study, a hybrid treatment system containing a chemical coagulation/flocculation followed by ultra-filtration (UF) membrane technology was developed for the wafer fabrication wastewater treatment. The chemical coagulation/flocculation unit was used as the pre-treatment process to improve the efficiency of the following ultra-filtration (UF) membrane system. The packaging wastewater was collected from a wafer fabrication factory and used to evaluate the feasibility of the coagulation/flocculation process on nano-scale particle removal. Results show that approximately 98% of turbidity could be removed at pH 7 when 2.2 mg/L of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) (used as coagulant) and 0.5 mg/L of polyacrylamide (cPAM) (used as flocculant) were added during the coagulation/flocculation process. Results indicate that the coagulation/flocculation is a feasible pre-treatment process for nano-particle removal before UF membrane is applied for further water purification. Results from this study will be helpful in designing a scale-up system for practical applications.</jats:p	['SDG06']
10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.07.051	UV filters, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene and ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA from untreated wastewater in sediment from eastern Mediterranean river transition and coastal zones	International audienceUVF may occur in the aquatic environment through two principal sources: direct inputs from recreational activities and indirect wastewater- and river-borne inputs. The aim of this study was to obtain a first overview of levels of three UVF (EHMC, OC and OD-PABA) in coastal areas subjected to river inputs, untreated wastewater discharges and dumpsite leachates. We selected three eastern Mediterranean rivers that have been impacted for decades by untreated wastewater release and collected sediment in the coastal zone during the hot and humid seasons. Western Mediterranean sites receiving treated wastewaters were analyzed for comparison. The results gave an overview of sediment contamination under these two contrasted situations representative of Mediterranean coastal areas without bathing activities. The analysis of the three UVF revealed the ubiquity and high point source contamination by EHMC and OC in transition and coastal zones, with levels as high as 128 ng g−1 d.w. OD-PABA was also frequently detected, but at lower concentrations (<LOD-17 ng g−1 d.w.). A temporal trend was observed, with a higher sediment concentration in the dry period (August and October). Based on these results, we conclude that there is background contamination from river input that could be exacerbated by the direct contribution in coastal bathing zones	['SDG06']
10.4081/ija.2012.e41	Irrigation treatments, water use efficiency and crop sustainability in cereal-forage rotations in Mediterranean environment	Agricultural systems based on crop rotation are beneficial to crop sustainability and productivity. Wheat-forage rotations combined with irrigation are the agronomic techniques best able to exploit Mediterranean environmental conditions. This paper describes a long-term field trial to ascertain the effect of combined irrigation and durum wheat-forage rotations on crop yield and soil chemical properties. The two forage crops: annual grass-clover winter binary mixture and perennial lucerne were carried out through 1991-2008 under rainfed and irrigated treatments. The experiments were used to highlight the effect of irrigation and wheat-forage crop rotations on water use efficiency (WUE) and sustainability of organic matter (OM) in topsoil. Irrigation increased the dry matter (DM) of annual binary mixture and lucerne by 49.1% and 66.9%, respectively. Continuous wheat rotation reduced seed yield (SY), stability of production, and crude protein (CP) characteristics of kernel and OM in topsoil. The yearly gain in wheat after forage crops was 0.04 t (ha yr)-1 under rainfed and 0.07 t (ha yr)-1 under irrigation treatments. The CP and soil OM of wheat forage crops rotations, compared with those of continuous wheat under rainfed and irrigated was a 0.8 and 0.5 % increase in CP and 5.1 and 4.4 in OM, respectively. The rotations of annual grass-clover winter binary mixture and lucerne meadow under both irrigated treatments increased the OM over continuous wheat (9.3 % and 8.5 in annual grass-clover winter binary mixture and 12.5 and 9.5 lucerne meadow under rainfed and irrigation, respectively). Irrigation reduced the impact of weather on crop growing, reducing water use efficiency (mean over rotations) for DM production (15.5 in meadow and 17.5 in annual grass-clover winter binary mixture [L water (kg DM)-1]) and wheat SY. However, the agronomic benefits achieved by forage crops in topsoil are exhausted after three years of continuous wheat rotation	['SDG06']
10.5367/oa.2012.0092	Climate change and the profitability of indigenous adaptation practices in smallholder agriculture in South East Nigeria	Climate change affects agriculture in many ways, one of which is its direct impact on food production. This is particularly significant in developing countries, where agriculture is mainly rain-fed, providing employment and income for the majority of the population. This paper, based on data from 400 randomly selected farmers in Enugu and Imo states in South East Nigeria, assesses some effects of climate change and the cost implications of farmers' adaptation practices. Virtually all respondents reported unusual rises in extreme events such as thunderstorms, heavy winds and intense heatwaves; uncertainties at the start of the farming season such as unusual early rains, erratic rainfall and delay in the onset of rain; the incidence of pests, diseases and weeds; and signs of land degradation such as declining soil fertility and the drying up of streams or rivers. The overall impact (on farm yield and income) was significantly higher for Enugu than for Imo, possibly because Enugu has drier weather. The greatest perceived effects of climate change were reduced yield and income, drying up of streams and rivers, reduced storage quality of crops, loss of pastureland and/or vegetation and the destruction of wildlife ecosystems. Coping strategies with a relatively high profitability index were multiple cropping/intercropping, agro-forestry/afforestation, mulching, purchase/ harvesting of water for irrigation and the use of resistant varieties. Extension services need to promote appropriate adaptation practices among farmers. </jats:p	['SDG06']

The results shown that the concentrations of NO3−, NH4+ and PO43− in the runoff from upland soils were 9.8~22.1 mg L−1, 0.429~0.818 mg L−1 and 0.025~0.052 mg L−1, respectively, and higher concentrations of NO3− (14.5~25.3 mg L−1) in the drainage waters from paddy soils. In karst areas, the concentrations of NO3− in the stream waters nearby agricultural lands was 14.9~28.5 mg L−1, as indicated by high concentration of NO3− compared with the Grade III of Surface Water Quality Standard of China, suggesting a eutrophication problem for surface water nearby agricultural lands with intensive cultivation.</jats:p	['SDG06']

The performance of pHFGE-1 was compared with that of the widely used pG-1 transformant vector. H. fabianii J640 (HF-TAMY) cells were transformed with pHFGE-1, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPH-499 (SC-TAMY) cells were transformed with pG-1, both of which carried the Taka-amylase. Expression of Taka-amylase by HF-TAMY showed higher than that by SC-TAMY. By using this new system, we bred the new wastewater treatment yeast that shows α-amylase activity. This yeast appears to grow well under experimental wastewater conditions, and is effective in treating model wastewater containing soluble and insoluble starch	['SDG06']

10.1098/rstb.2013.0164	The global nitrogen cycle in the Twentyfirst century	Global nitrogen fixation contributes 413 Tg of reactive nitrogen (N(r)) to terrestrial and marine ecosystems annually of which anthropogenic activities are responsible for half, 210 Tg N. The majority of the transformations of anthropogenic N(r) are on land (240 Tg N yr(−1)) within soils and vegetation where reduced N(r) contributes most of the input through the use of fertilizer nitrogen in agriculture. Leakages from the use of fertilizer N(r) contribute to nitrate (NO(3)(−)) in drainage waters from agricultural land and emissions of trace N(r) compounds to the atmosphere. Emissions, mainly of ammonia (NH(3)) from land together with combustion related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), contribute 100 Tg N yr(−1) to the atmosphere, which are transported between countries and processed within the atmosphere, generating secondary pollutants, including ozone and other photochemical oxidants and aerosols, especially ammonium nitrate (NH(4)NO(3)) and ammonium sulfate (NH(4))(2)SO(4). Leaching and riverine transport of NO(3) contribute 40–70 Tg N yr(−1) to coastal waters and the open ocean, which together with the 30 Tg input to oceans from atmospheric deposition combine with marine biological nitrogen fixation (140 Tg N yr(−1)) to double the ocean processing of N(r). Some of the marine N(r) is buried in sediments, the remainder being denitrified back to the atmosphere as N(2) or N(2)O. The marine processing is of a similar magnitude to that in terrestrial soils and vegetation, but has a larger fraction of natural origin. The lifetime of N(r) in the atmosphere, with the exception of N(2)O, is only a few weeks, while in terrestrial ecosystems, with the exception of peatlands (where it can be 10(2)–10(3) years), the lifetime is a few decades. In the ocean, the lifetime of N(r) is less well known but seems to be longer than in terrestrial ecosystems and may represent an important long-term source of N(2)O that will respond very slowly to control measures on the sources of N(r) from which it is produced	['SDG06']

The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, it was concluded that the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and trichloroacetic acids. The Hi fraction with amino and carboxyl groups had the potential to form dichloroacetic acids and chlorinated trihalomethanes. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V	['SDG06']

The results showed that under the condition of irrigated 120 mm during the winter wheat growing season, the treatment which irrigated 60 mm each at jointing and heading stages, the leaf area index significantly (LSD, P&lt;0.05) increased at milky stage, which was mainly due to increase the leaf area index at 0－20 and more than 60 cm above the ground surface. The 2 growing season results revealed that dry matter accumulation at maturity stage in T3 was significantly (LSD, P&lt;0.05) higher than those in T1 and T2. Compared with T2, the root length density in T1 and T3 were significantly (LSD, P&lt;0.05) higher below the ground surface 50 cm. The results indicated that irrigated 60 mm each at jointing and heading stages during the winter wheat growing seasons, grain yield was the highest, which could be attributed to significantly (LSD, P&lt;0.05) increase the spike numbers. Under the condition of irrigated 120 mm during the winter wheat growing seasons in North China Plain, it is suggests that winter wheat should be irrigated 60 mm each at jointing and heading stages, to achieve reasonable water use efficiency and grain yield.</jats:p	['SDG06']

10.1016/j.agee.2015.01.006	Cotton crop water use and water use efficiency in a changing climate	© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Daily outputs from the CSIRO Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model, driven by four general circulation models, were used in a stochastic weather generator, LARS-WG, to construct local climate scenarios for key cotton production areas in eastern Australia. These scenarios along with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were then linked to a process-oriented cotton model (CSIRO OZCOT) to quantify their potential impacts on cotton lint yield, water use, and water use efficiency (WUE) under irrigated and rain-fed conditions in 2030. For irrigated cotton, we considered four water supply levels (2, 4, 6 and 8ML/ha) at nine cotton production locations (Emerald, Dalby, St. George, Goondiwindi, Moree, Bourke, Narrabri, Warren and Hillston). For rain-fed cotton, we considered three planting configurations (solid, single skip and double skip) at four locations (Emerald, Dalby, Moree and Narrabri). Simulation results show that (1) season temperatures will increase 1-1.2°C and rainfall will increase 2-16% across locations; (2) for irrigated cotton (assuming full access to water and nitrogen), cotton crop water use will increase 0-4% in more than half of the cases (the combinations of the number of locations and water supply levels); cotton lint yield will increase 0-26% and WUE will increase 0-24% in most of the cases due to counteractive effects of elevated CO2 and future climate, which are location- and water supply-specific; (3) for rain-fed cotton (assuming full initial soil profile), cotton water use will increase 2-8% at Emerald and Narrabri and decrease by -5 to -2% at Dalby and Moree; cotton lint yield will increase 4-26% in most of the cases and WUE will increase 2-22% in all cases. For irrigated cotton, it was found that water supply level with 2ML/ha generated the greatest positive effects to future climate scenarios across locations except at Dalby where 4ML/ha was greatest. For rain-fed cotton, a solid planting configuration had the greatest positive response to future climate scenarios at Emerald, Dalby and Moree while double skip planting generated the maximum benefit in lint yield at Narrabri. This simulation analysis also demonstrated the ability of the OZCOT in capturing the interactive effects of elevated CO2 and future climate, indicating the usefulness of this tool in this important research area	['SDG06']

Permitted facilities in Missouri, USA, are required to regularly sample, analyse and report discharged water quality. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources stores the results in a central database, which was queried and analysed to assess the performance of these facilities in both the summer and winter seasons and to determine if a correlation exists between ammonia removal and flow capacity. The RSFs were found to discharge ammonia under 44 mg/l 95% of the time in winter and under 30 mg/l in summer. No correlation between performance and flow was found. The results of the study suggest that RSF technology is presently unable to treat ammonia in domestic wastewater to meet acceptable water quality standards for surface discharge. </jats:p	['SDG06']

In this research, a proper methodology was proposed to determine the uncertainty of support vector machine (SVM) for the prediction of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). In this regard, the SVM model was calibrated using different records for many times (here, 1000 times), to investigate model performance according to calibration pattern changes. Therefore, to implement the random selection of calibration patterns for several times, an alternative database was required. By this methodology, the parameters of SVM model will be obtained 1000 times, giving various predicted BOD5 values each time. To evaluate the SVM model’s uncertainty, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factor) were selected. Findings indicated that the SVM model was more sensitive to capacity parameter (C) than to kernel parameter (Gamma) and error tolerance (Epsilon). Besides, results showed that the SVM model had acceptable uncertainty in BOD5 prediction. It is notified that the novelty of the presented methodology is beyond a mere application to water resources, and can also be used in other fields of sciences and engineering.No Full Tex	['SDG06']
10.1071/wr15015	A model for assessing mammal contribution of Escherichia coli to a Texas floodplain	Context Free-ranging mammals contribute to faecal pollution in United States water bodies. However, research into wildlife impact on water quality is dependent upon unreliable data (e.g. data uncertainty, unknown importance of parameters). Aims Our goal was to determine the potential impacts of common free-ranging mammal species and their management on Escherichia coli in the study floodplain. Our objectives for this research were to construct a model from study area- and literature-derived data, determine important species for E. coli deposition, and conduct sensitivity analyses on model parameters to focus future research efforts. Methods We constructed a model that incorporated parameters for four wildlife species known to contribute E. coli in central Texas: raccoons (Procyon lotor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and wild pigs (Sus scrofa). These parameters were (1) population density estimates, (2) defaecation rates, (3) defaecation areas, (4) E. coli concentration in faecal material estimates, and (5) E. coli survival. We conducted sensitivity analyses on the model parameters to determine relative importance of each parameter and areas for additional study. Key results We found that adjustment of raccoon and Virginia opossum population densities had higher impacts on E. coli in the floodplain than similar changes in other species across all spatial and seasonal variations. We also found that the changes in E. coli survival, E. coli concentration in raccoon faecal material, and defaecation rates had the highest impacts on E. coli in the floodplain. Conclusions Our sensitivity analyses indicated that the largest impacts to projected E. coli loads were from changes in defaecation rates followed by E. coli concentration in faecal material and E. coli survival. Watershed planners, ranchers, and regulators must be cautioned that faecal deposition patterns are location specific and could significantly impact which species are considered the most important contributors. Implications Although all parameters require more research, we recommend that researchers determine defaecation rates for contributing species due to their relatively large impacts on E. coli in comparison to the other parameters. We also suggest additional research in free-ranging wildlife faecal morphology (form and structure) and area of deposition. Finally, species-specific E. coli survival studies for free-ranging wildlife should be conducted.</jats:p	['SDG06']

Consistent with increased temperatures, annual actual evapotranspiration rose significantly (+37.1mm per decade) over the study period. Precipitation also trended upward, with October experiencing the most significant increases in monthly total rainfall (+8.2mm per decade). While augmented October precipitation led to increased October streamflow (+5.0mm per decade), the trend in WE-38 streamflow was downward, with the most significant declines in July (-1.2mm per decade) and February (-7.5mm per decade). Declines in summertime streamflow also increased the duration of hydrological droughts (maximum consecutive days with streamflow < 10th percentile) by 1.9 days per decade. While our findings suggest some challenges for producers and water resource managers, most notably with increased fall rainfall and runoff, some changes such as enhanced growing seasons can be viewed positively, at least in the near term	['SDG06']

10.1139/cjfas-2015-0210	Influence of hydrological connectivity on winter limnology in floodplain lakes of the Saskatchewan River Delta, Saskatchewan	Globally, hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplains has been reduced by river flow management and land transformation. The Saskatchewan River Delta is North America’s largest inland delta and a hub for fish and fur production. To determine the influence of connectivity on limnology within this northern floodplain, water chemistry and stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) were analyzed during the winter of 2014 in 26 shallow lakes along a hydrological gradient. A total of five lake connectivity categories were determined by optical remote sensing imagary of surface water coverage area from years of varying flood intensities. Accuracy of categories was verified by degree of 18O and 2H enrichment within lakes. Both isotopes showed marked successional enrichment between connectivity categories, with more isolated lakes exhibiting greater enrichment. Water chemistry in lakes with greater connectivity to the main channel were characterized by higher pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and sulfates and lower total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and ammonium compared with more isolated lakes. These findings illustrate how connectivity influences water chemistry in northern floodplain lakes and how it might determine the suitability of these lakes as winter refuge for fishes. Additionally, our study provides supporting evidence for the effective use of optical remote sensing imagery, an inexpensive and accessible source of data for researchers, when determining connectivity characteristics of large northern floodplain systems. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that the inundation of floodplain lakes by river water during peak discharge has an impact on the conditions within the lakes long into the winter ice-cover season. Understanding the year-round influence of river–floodplain connection is imperative for assessing potential impacts of climate change and future water regulation on such ecosystems. </jats:p	['SDG06']

10.3389/fmicb.2015.01405	Year-long metagenomic study of river microbiomes across land use and water quality	Select bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or coliforms, have been widely used as sentinels of low water quality; however, there are concerns regarding their predictive accuracy for the protection of human and environmental health. To develop improved monitoring systems, a greater understanding of bacterial community structure, function, and variability across time is required in the context of different pollution types, such as agricultural and urban contamination. Here, we present a year-long survey of free-living bacterial DNA collected from seven sites along rivers in three watersheds with varying land use in Southwestern Canada. This is the first study to examine the bacterial metagenome in flowing freshwater (lotic) environments over such a time span, providing an opportunity to describe bacterial community variability as a function of land use and environmental conditions. Characteristics of the metagenomic data, such as sequence composition and average genome size (AGS), vary with sampling site, environmental conditions, and water chemistry. For example, AGS was correlated with hours of daylight in the agricultural watershed and, across the agriculturally and urban-affected sites, k-mer composition clustering corresponded to nutrient concentrations. In addition to indicating a community shift, this change in AGS has implications in terms of the normalization strategies required, and considerations surrounding such strategies in general are discussed. When comparing abundances of gene functional groups between high- and low-quality water samples collected from an agricultural area, the latter had a higher abundance of nutrient metabolism and bacteriophage groups, possibly reflecting an increase in agricultural runoff. This work presents a valuable dataset representing a year of monthly sampling across watersheds and an analysis targeted at establishing a foundational understanding of how bacterial lotic communities vary across time and land use. The results provide important context for future studies, including further analyses of watershed ecosystem health, and the identification and development of biomarkers for improved water quality monitoring systems	['SDG06']

Biological water treatment systems with microalgae are now widely accepted. Moreover, algal wastewater treatment systems are effective when compared to conventional treatment systems. The proposed purification system aims to provide a process for using saline water, and saline reject water produced in water purification for gold mining production. Also, it provides a method for growing and harvesting algae utilizing saline water as growth medium for recycling waste water to extract the remaining metals from it.

10.5586/aa.2014.013	Phytocenotic structure and physico-chemical properties of a small water body in agricultural landscape	Small water bodies, until recently considered as wasteland, are an essential element of the so-called small water retention. Their main use can vary significantly, but they always play a positive role by increasing water resources and enhancing the natural values of the landscape. Moreover, by increasing bio- diversity thanks to plants forming habitats for many species of flora and fauna, small water bodies act as a biofilter, improving water quality. But these small reservoirs belong to the groups of waters that are most exposed to damage, especially within the catchment area. Because of the invaluable role of small farmland water bodies, a study was undertaken to investigate their phytocenotic structure. In addition, an attempt was made to assess the level of threats and to indicate their role in the development of habitat conditions. The investigated reservoir was created in 2007. Before that time, it functioned as a part of the Zemborzycki reservoir, as they were close to each other. Almost the entire surrounding of this small reservoir consisted of farmland. In 2011 a revitalization project was carried out in the reservoir. Plants typical for wetland habitats were mainly introduced, while synanthropic vegetation was removed. Based on chemical and physical analyses, it can be concluded that the investigated reservoir serves as a natural biofilter thanks to the qualitative and quantitative changes in the structure of macrophytes. After the revitalization project, the investigated pond gained new aesthetic and ecological qualities	['SDG06']

10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034024	Flared natural gas-based onsite atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) for oilfield operations	Natural gas worth tens of billions of dollars is flared annually, which leads to resource waste and environmental issues. This work introduces and analyzes a novel concept for flared gas utilization, wherein the gas that would have been flared is instead used to condense atmospheric moisture. Natural gas, which is currently being flared, can alternatively power refrigeration systems to generate the cooling capacity for large scale atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). This approach solves two pressing issues faced by the oil–gas industry, namely gas flaring, and sourcing water for oilfield operations like hydraulic fracturing, drilling and water flooding. Multiple technical pathways to harvest atmospheric moisture by using the energy of natural gas are analyzed. A modeling framework is developed to quantify the dependence of water harvest rates on flared gas volumes and ambient weather. Flaring patterns in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota are analyzed to quantify the benefits of AWH. Overall, the gas currently flared annually in Texas and North Dakota can harvest enough water to meet 11% and 65% of the water consumption in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, respectively. Daily harvests of upto 30 000 and 18 000 gallons water can be achieved using the gas currently flared per well in Texas and North Dakota, respectively. In fifty Bakken sites, the water required for fracturing or drilling a new well can be met via onsite flared gas-based AWH in only 3 weeks, and 3 days, respectively. The benefits of this concept are quantified for the Eagle Ford and Bakken Shales. Assessments of the global potential of this concept are presented using data from countries with high flaring activity. It is seen that this waste-to-value conversion concept offers significant economic benefits while addressing critical environmental issues pertaining to oil–gas production	['SDG06']

We estimated data on the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CH4 (pCH(4)) from sampling with 95 lakes in semi-humid/semi-arid region of Northeastern China during ice free period. Both pCO(2) and pCH(4) varied greatly among the study sites. p(CO2) values in these lakes ranged from 21.9 to 30,152.3 mu atm (n = 403), and 91% of lakes in this survey were supersaturated with CO2. p(CH4) values ranged from 12.6 to 139,630.7 atm with all sites in this study of CH4 sources to the atmosphere during the ice-free period. The collected urban lakes samples exhibited higher pCO(2) and pCH(4) than wild lakes samples. Either the mean value of p(CO2) or p(CH4) in saline waters is higher than in fresh waters. Correlation analysis implied that the partial pressure of the GHGs (CO2 and CH4) showed statistically correlations with water environment indicators like pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chla). However, the most of the relationships showed a high degree of scatter, only pH might be used as the predictor of the gas partial pressure based on the result of this study (r(pCO2) = -0.437, p < 0.01, n = 382; r(pCH4) = -0265, p < 0.01, n = 400). Furthermore, salinity could be a good predictor for p(CO2) and p(CH4) in 83 freshwater lakes in our study (r(pCO2) = 0.365, r(pCH4) = 0.323, p < 0.01, n = 348). The mean CO2 flux increased with the decreasing lake area size. The calculated annual areal carbon emission rate is 560.2 g C m(-2) from 95 lakes in Northeastern China. We could not extrapolate carbon emission from these lakes to the boreal region or a wider scale because of the change of environmental conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved	['SDG06']

10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.119	Using hydrodynamic model to predict PFOS and PFOA transport in the Daling River and its tributary, a heavily polluted river into the Bohai Sea, China	Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are extremely persistent in the environment, and have the potential for long-range transport. The present study focused on the Daling River and its tributary, a larger river flowing into Liaodong Bay of the Bohai Sea. Recent studies have shown the elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA in the Daling River. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the seasonal changes, fate and transport modeling of PFOS and PFOA concentrations using one-dimensional DHI MIKE-11 river model. We designed three scenarios to assess the risk of PFOS and PFOA in surface water: the measured concentrations, constant maximum and the magnitude of a continuous constant load. The mean absolute errors divided by the mean of measured concentrations were 41-64% for PFOS and 29-36% for PFOA. The result indicated that PFOS and PFOA in the downstream of the Daling River would not reach a harmful level with the current load. The fluorochemical parks contributed an average of 44.57% of the total PFOS and 95.44% of the total PFOA flow that reached the estuary. The mass flow was observed as 1.74 kg y(-1) for PFOS and 40.57 kg y(-1) for PFOA to the Bohai Sea. These modeling results may be useful for monitoring the status and trends of emerging POPs and will help the determination of the risk to both humans and wildlife, in the estuarine and coastal areas of the Bohai Sea, China.

Both AFMBRs exhibited comparable organic removal efficiency and membrane performances. In the single-stage AFMBR, less soluble organic substances were removed through biosorption by GAC and biodegradation than those in the two-stage AFMBR. Compared to the two-stage AFMBR, the formation of cake layer was the main cause of the observed membrane fouling in the single-stage AFMBR at the same employed flux. The accumulation rate of the biopolymers was linearly correlated with the membrane fouling rate. In the chemical-cleaned foulants, humic acid-like substances and silicon were identified as the predominant organic and inorganic fouants respectively. As such, the fluidized GAC particles might not be effective in removing these substances from the membrane surfaces. High-throughout pyrosequencing analysis further revealed that beta-Proteobacteria were predominant members in both AFMBRs, which contributed to the development of biofilms on the fluidized GAC and membrane surfaces. However, it was also noted that the abundance of the identified dominant in the membrane surface-associated biofilm seemed to be related to the permeate flux and reactor configuration.NRF (Natl Research Foundation, S’pore)EDB (Economic Devt.

System performance and efficiency, and then cost, is mainly affected by membrane fouling, which is still not well understood and controlled appropriately. In this study, the influence of content and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on a membrane ultrafiltration (UF) stage from a full-scale UF stage in a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) fed with surface water, groundwater (or blends of them) was investigated. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize and assess DOM changes in water samples Water streams feeding the UF stage showed high variability in DOM content and composition. FEEM-PARAFAC analysis allowed the differentiation of seven different organic components. Additionally to the characterization and monitoring of DOM in the full-scale UF stage, a bench scale UF pilot was run to experimentally correlate the impact of water quality with membrane performance. The experiments included testing synthetic solutions of model foulants (synthetic humic acid and bovine serum albumin) and blends of complex waters. To quantify fouling, the total fouling index (TFI) and the hydraulically irreversible fouling index (HIFI) were calculated for each filtration run. According to the results obtained, the correlation plots between the PARAFAC components and the fouling indices pointed at microbial byproducts (C1) and humic-like components (C2, C4, C5) as the ones showing higher correlations	['SDG06']

Novel nanocomposites were successfully prepared by using an esterification reaction between β-cyclodextrin/γ-(2,3-epoxypropoxy) propyl trimethoxysilane grafted graphene oxide (β-CD/GPTMS/GO). The β-CD/GPTMS/GO nanocomposites were used to remove the Cu2+ from aqueous solutions. The characteristics of β-CD/GPTMS/GO were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The dispersibility of graphene oxide was excellent due to the addition of β-CD. The adsorption isotherms data obtained at the optimum pH 7 were fitted by Langmuir isotherm model. The excellent adsorption properties of β-CD/GPTMS/GO for Cu2+ ions could be attributed to the apolar cavity structure of β-CD, the high surface area and abundant functional groups on the surface of GO. The adsorption patterns of β-CD/GPTMS/GO were electrostatic attraction, formation of host-guest inclusion complexes and the ion exchange adsorption. The efficient adsorption of β-CD/GPTMS/GO for Cu2+ ions suggested that these novel nanocomposites may be ideal candidates for removing other cation pollutants from waste water.</jats:p	['SDG06']

Metagenomes were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq platform and were analyzed using MG-RAST, STAMP and PAST software. The EGSB and UASB reactors were more closely related based on taxonomic and functional profiles, likely due to similar granular sludge and procedures adopted to ensure anaerobic conditions. The EGSB and UASB reactors showed a predominance of methanogens and genes related to methanogenesis, with a prevalence of the acetoclastic pathway, in addition to the peripheral and central O-2-independent pathways for aromatic compound degradation. By contrast, FBR showed a dominance of aerobic microbiota and pathways for O-2-dependent aromatic compound degradation. Therefore, although the reactors showed similar surfactant removal levels, the microbial composition, functional diversity and aromatic compound degradation pathways were significantly distinct.

10.1515/jwld-2017-0075	Community engagement for irrigation water management in Lao PDR	AbstractSustainable water resources management and community engagement are essential for water security. Referring to the above context, this study proposed to carry out an assessment of community engagement for irrigation water management in the Nam Haad Left Irrigation Project (NHLIP). The household and community level practices and the farmers’ levels of participation in irrigation water management of the NHLIP were carefully considered. From respondents’ responses, the results revealed that a husband-wife partnership plays a remarkable role in irrigation water management of the NHLIP for rice farming. The results also proved that most of the respondents engage with a high participation level in managing irrigation water of the NHLIP project as illustrated by a high score of 3.80 on the five-point Likert scale. To determine the significance of each activity on farmers’ levels of participation in irrigation water management of the NHLIP, a stepwise multiple regression analysis was employed and the standardized regression equation for determining overall participation levels can be presented as:Y= 0.538x1+ 0.831x8+ 0.534x14+ 0.607x18+ 7.572. Finally, the outcomes of this study indicated the willingness of participation in cooperating and supporting the activities related to the improvement and management of the NHLIP project.</jats:p	['SDG06']

10.1007/s10661-018-6528-3	Predicting soil water content at − 33 kPa by pedotransfer functions in stoniness 1 soils in northeast Venezuela	Soil water content is a key property in the study of water available for plants, infiltration, drainage, hydraulic conductivity, irrigation, plant water stress and solute movement. However, its measurement consumes time and, in the case of stony soils, the presence of stones difficult to determinate the water content. An alternative is the use of pedotransfer functions (PTFs), as models to predict these properties from readily available data. The present work shows a comparison of different widely used PTFs to estimate water content at-33 kPa (WR - 33kPa ) in high stoniness soils. The work was carried out in the Caramacate River, an area of high interest because the frequent landslides worsen the quality of drinking water. The performance of all evaluated PTFs was compared with a PTF generated for the study area. Results showed that the Urach's PTF presented the best performance in relation to the others and could be used to estimate WR -33kPa in soils of Caramacate River basin. The calculated PTFs had a R2 of 0.65. This was slightly higher than the R2 of the Urach's PTF. The inclusion of the rock fragment volume could have the better results. The weak performance of the other PTFs could be related to the fact that the mountain soils of the basin are rich in 2:1 clay and high stoniness, which were not used as independent variables for PTFs to estimate the WR -33kPa.The authors are grateful to the Abdus Salam  International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy,  the Venezuelan Organic Law for Science and Technology  (LOCTI), and the Council of Scientific and Humanistic Develop-  ment (CDCH) of the Universidad Central de Venezuela, the  Universidad de Lleida (Catalonia, Spain), and the Brazilian Re-  search Council (CNPq) for the scholarships and funding	['SDG06']

10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.04.017	Water-energy-food nexus of sugarcane ethanol production in the state of Goiás, Brazil: An analysis with regional input-output matrix	© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Concerns about impacts of biomass growth for biofuel production emphasize the importance of planning energy crops expansion considering land, water, food and biodiversity. Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer worldwide and sugarcane is cultivated in many regions, including the Brazilian Cerrado (a Savannah-type biome). This paper analyses the impacts of first-generation sugarcane expansion in the Paranaíba basin (Goiás State), focusing on how future demand for ethanol could affect local resources availability. The study area is a sugarcane expansion frontier in Brazil, thus, the Cerrado biome should be focus of research considering competition for land and water uses. An economic-ecologic Input-Output (IO) framework was applied to develop a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus analysis. The Goiás’ IO table was expanded to assess water, energy and land uses, GHG emissions and employment levels through six different ethanol supply scenarios. Results show that if sugarcane expansion projected to 2030 considers the Goiás’ extended IO structure for the year 2008, it should cause little impact on land and water availability in the state, due to both the ample availability of suitable pasturelands for sugarcane expansion as well as water in most of the Paranaíba basin. The WEF nexus analysis is a valuable tool on guiding the sustainable management of natural resources considering water, energy, land use and GHG emissions as goals to the same policy. In particular, the hybrid extended IO-WEF nexus framework is useful to design effective biofuel policies, collectively addressing impacts on environmental, social and economic spheres, in a local or broader context	['SDG06']

Competitive effects with organic matter removal by aluminium sulphate during coagulation were also quantified. Data on raw and finished water quality following jar tests, as well as chemical dosages and treatment performance, were statistically analysed, and a data-driven prediction model was developed. The developed powdered activated carbon dosage prediction model can be used by the plant operators for rapid dosage assessment and can increase the preparedness of the plant to sudden taste and odour events. It was also found that total organic carbon levels and properties greatly affect the ability of powdered activated carbon to remove taste and odour compounds; on the other hand, total organic carbon removal is not affected by high taste and odour levels, since these were still much lower than organic carbon concentrations.Griffith Sciences, School of Engineering and Built EnvironmentFull Tex	['SDG06']
10.3390/plants7020029	Effect of silicon on the tolerance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to salt stress at different growth stages: Case study for the management of irrigation water	This paper aims to determine the most tolerant growth stage(s) of wheat to salinity stress with the addition of silicon. The aim was to investigate whether saline water could be used instead of good quality water for irrigation without implicating a greater risk to crop production. Local wheat cv. Gimmiza 11 was germinated and grown in sand cultures. Four different NaCl salinity levels were used as treatments: 0, 60, 90 and 120 mM. This was in the presence of 0 and 0.78 mM Si which added as sodium meta- silicate (Na2SiO3·9H2O). Both the NaCl and Si treatments were carried out using a full strength nutrient solution that was adjusted at pH 6.0 and used for irrigation in four replications. The application of Si with the saline nutrient media significantly enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in plant leaves at the booting stage compared to the other stages. This was associated with a marked decline in the H2O2 content. At the booting stage, the Si treatment promoted CAT activity in 120 mM NaCl-stressed leaves compared to the leaves treated with only 120 mM NaCl solution. SOD showed greater prevalence at the booting stage when Si was added into the saline media, and it also revealed maximum activity at the milky stage with salinity stress. This was associated with a smaller reduction in shoot fresh and dry weights, greater reduction in the leaf Na+ content and an increase in the K+ content, which ultimately increased the cytosolic K+/Na+ ratio. Chlorophyll a and b and carotenoid (total photosynthetic pigments) were also higher at the booting stage of salt-stressed plants treated with Si compared to other stages. Accordingly, Si application enhanced the salt tolerance of wheat and reduced the inhibitory effect of Na+ and oxidative stress damage as growth proceeded towards maturity, particularly at the booting stage. This shows that saline water can be used for wheat irrigation at the booting stage (much water is consumed) when good quality water is not available for supplemental irrigation. A field study is needed to confirm the greenhouse results	['SDG06']
10.3390/agriculture8050067	The effect of supplemental irrigation on canopy temperature depression, chlorophyll content, and water use efficiency in three wheat (Triticum aestivum L. and T. durum Desf.) varieties grown in dry regions of Jordan	One critical challenge facing the world is the need to satisfy the food requirements of the dramatically growing population. Drought stress is one of the main limiting factors in the wheat-producing regions; therefore, wheat yield stability is a major objective of wheat-breeding programs in Jordan, which experience fluctuating climatic conditions in the context of global climate change. In the current study, a two-year field experiment was conducted for exploring the effect of four different water regimes on the yield, yield components, and stability of three wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; T. durum Desf.) Jordanian cultivars as related to Canopy Temperature Depression (CTD), and Chlorophyll Content (measured by Soil-Plant Analysis Development, SPAD). A split plot design was used in this experiment with four replicates. Water treatment was applied as the main factor: with and without supplemental irrigation; 0%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of field capacity were applied. Two durum wheat cultivars and one bread wheat cultivar were split over irrigation treatments as a sub factor. In both growing seasons, supplemental irrigation showed a significant increase in grain yield compared to the rain-fed conditions. This increase in grain yield was due to the significantly positive effect of water availability on yield components. Values of CTD, SPAD, harvest index, and water use efficiency (WUE) were increased significantly with an increase in soil moisture and highly correlated with grain yield. Ammon variety produced the highest grain yield across the four water regimes used in this study. This variety was characterized by the least thermal time to maturity and the highest values of CTD and SPAD. It was concluded that Ammon had the highest stability among the cultivars tested. Furthermore, CTD and SPAD can be used as important selection parameters in breeding programs in Jordan to assist in developing high-yielding genotypes under drought and heat stress conditions	['SDG06']
10.3389/fpls.2018.00769	Prioritization of candidate genes in qtl regions for physiological and biochemical traits underlying drought response in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)	Drought is one of the most adverse abiotic factors limiting growth and productivity of crops. Among them is barley, ranked fourth cereal worldwide in terms of harvested acreage and production. Plants have evolved various mechanisms to cope with water deficit at different biological levels, but there is an enormous challenge to decipher genes responsible for particular complex phenotypic traits, in order to develop drought tolerant crops. This work presents a comprehensive approach for elucidation of molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in barley at the seedling stage of development. The study includes mapping of QTLs for physiological and biochemical traits associated with drought tolerance on a high-density function map, projection of QTL confidence intervals on barley physical map, and the retrievement of positional candidate genes (CGs), followed by their prioritization based on Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. A total of 64 QTLs for 25 physiological and biochemical traits that describe plant water status, photosynthetic efficiency, osmoprotectant and hormone content, as well as antioxidant activity, were positioned on a consensus map, constructed using RIL populations developed from the crosses between European and Syrian genotypes. The map contained a total of 875 SNP, SSR and CGs, spanning 941.86 cM with resolution of 1.1 cM. For the first time, QTLs for ethylene, glucose, sucrose, maltose, raffinose, α-tocopherol, γ-tocotrienol content, and catalase activity, have been mapped in barley. Based on overlapping confidence intervals of QTLs, 11 hotspots were identified that enclosed more than 60% of mapped QTLs. Genetic and physical map integration allowed the identification of 1,101 positional CGs within the confidence intervals of drought response-specific QTLs. Prioritization resulted in the designation of 143 CGs, among them were genes encoding antioxidants, carboxylic acid biosynthesis enzymes, heat shock proteins, small auxin up-regulated RNAs, nitric oxide synthase, ATP sulfurylases, and proteins involved in regulation of flowering time. This global approach may be proposed for identification of new CGs that underlies QTLs responsible for complex traits	['SDG06']

Degradation capacity of the predator bacterium, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, was used as a cleaning strategy for reducing membrane fouling.  Method: Wastewater with different sludge age and hydraulic retention time were filtered through Poly(ether)sulphone (PES) membranes using dead end reactor. Change in filtration performance after cleaning of membrane surface by B. bacteriovorus was measured by comparison of flux values. Bacterial community of the sludge was determined by 16SrRNA sequence analysis. Community profile of membrane surface was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization technique.  Results: After cleaning of MP005 and UP150 membranes with predator bacteria, 4.8 L/m2·h and 2.04 L/m2·h increase in stable flux at steady state condition was obtained as compared to the control, respectively. Aeromonas, Proteus, and Alcaligenes species were found to be dominant members of the sludge. Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus lysed pure cultures of the isolated sludge bacteria successfully. FISH analysis of the membrane surface showed that Alfa-proteobacteria are the most numerous bacteria among the biofilm community on the membrane surface.  Conclusion: Results suggested that cleaning of MBR membranes with B. bacteriovorus has a potential to be used as a biological cleaning method.</jats:sec	['SDG06']

The first sampling point is located in a high zone with domestic agricultural activities, the second point around the mid-point of the flow of the river, and the third point at the lowest zone with extensive agricultural activities mainly centered on the production of fresh vegetables. Eleven physicochemical parameters (As, Cd, Cr, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+, NO3−, Pb, pH, percent saturation of dissolved oxygen (PSO), and total suspended solids (TSS)) and two microbiological parameters (fecal coliforms and enterococci) were evaluated. We evaluated three different Canadian Water Quality Indexes (CWIs): CWI-1 included only physicochemical parameters, CWI-2 included CWI-1 parameters plus fecal coliforms, and CWI-3 included CWI-2 in addition to enterococci. Statistical analysis of individual parameters showed significant differences between sampling sites. CWI-1 was unable to discriminate between the three sampling points, and characterized the water quality as ‘fair’. CWI-2 was only able to discriminate when the water contained high levels of chemical and microbiological contaminants, while CWI-3 adequately discriminated water quality at each of the sampling points. The evaluation of enterococci together with more traditional water quality parameters enabled better categorization of surface water quality.UCR::Vicerrectoría de Investigación::Unidades de Investigación::Ciencias de la Salud::Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud (INISA)UCR::Vicerrectoría de Investigación::Unidades de Investigación::Ciencias Básicas::Centro en Investigación en Contaminación Ambiental (CICA	['SDG06']

It is a collaborative  effort of the UF/IFAS Extension St. Lucie County, St. Lucie County Environmental Resources Department, and partner agencies. Four UF/IFAS Florida Master Naturalist volunteers were recruited and received training and supplies to conduct water quality testing and algae collection in the Indian  River Lagoon as part of the Volunteer Algae Monitoring Program (VAMP). The UF/IFAS research and extension faculty developed VAMP in response to the 2016 harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Indian River Lagoon that resulted in dramatic impacts on businesses, residents, and visitors in Martin,  St. Lucie, and Indian River counties. These HAB episodes demonstrate the importance of having informed citizen scientists with an understanding of the problems and threats. The VAMP citizen scientists conducted a water quality awareness survey with the general public after proactively scouting  for HABs by collecting samples and conducting water quality testing at three waypoints in the Indian River Lagoon during May to November 2017 (excluding October) and February 2018. They utilized UF/IFAS Water Watch chemistry tests and processed and shipped water samples to the Laughinghouse  Lab at the UF/IFAS Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center, which conducted algae counts and genetic testing to determine the presence of harmful algae expressing microcystin-producing genes. Test results indicated fluctuating and inconsistent levels of saxitoxin but no indications of  microcystins across the three sites and over time.</jats:p	['SDG06']
10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.805-806.1404	How welfare variables influence energy consumption? -evidence from Ecuador and Mexico	Energy consumption (EC) can be seen as a two-edged sword. It can be not only essential for sustaining good standards of living but also in hindering environmental protection. Consequently, what is the causal relationship between welfare variables and energy consumption in different economies has become one of the focal issues for both policy makers and researchers. The aim of this study attempts to investigate the causal relationship between economic growth (EG), foreign direct investment (FDI), remittances (RMTs), human development index (HDI), and EC using annual data from 1981 to 2011 through multivariate Granger causality tests for Ecuador and Mexico. The empirical analysis indicates that for Ecuador, in the long run, there are unidirectional causalities flowing from FDI, HDI, and RMTs to EC. For Mexico, there is no evidence of any welfare variable flowing to EC but there are unidirectional causalities running from EC to RMTs, HDI to FDI, and FDI to GDP all in the long run. With this information, we suggest policy makers of these two countries, especially for Ecuador, to strongly advocate energy-saving concepts to the public and actively implement more infrastructure projects related to health and education, provide incentives for international advanced green technology transformation, and liberalize international remittances.</jats:p	['SDG07']
10.1068/a41400	Renewable energy and sociotechnical change: Imagined subjectivities of 'the public' and their implications	The public’ are potentially implicated in processes of sociotechnical change as political actors who welcome or resist technology development in general, or in particular places and settings. We argue in this paper that the potential influence of public subjectivities on sociotechnical change is realised not only through moments of active participation and protest, but also through ‘the public’ being imagined, given agency, and invoked for various purposes by actors in technical – industrial and policy networks. As a case study we explore the significance of an imagined and anticipated public subjectivity for the development of renewable energy technologies in the UK. We use interviews with a diversity of industry and policy actors to explore how imaginaries of the public are constructed from first-hand and mediated experience and knowledge, and the influence these imagined public subjectivities may have on development trajectories and on actor strategies and activities. We show how the shared expectation of an ever present latent but conditional public hostility to renewable energy project development is seen as shaping the material forms of the technologies, their evolving spatiality, and practices of public engagement involved in obtaining project consent. Implications for the actors we are interested in and for broader questions of democratic practice are considered	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.06.010	Beyond biofuels: Assessing global land use for domestic consumption of biomass. A conceptual and empirical contribution to sustainable management of global resources	Consumption of natural resources should not exceed sustainable levels. The increasing use of biofuels and to some extent biomaterials, on top of rising food and feed demands, is causing countries to use a growing amount of global land, which may lead to land use conflicts and the expansion of cropland and intensive cultivation at the expense of natural ecosystems. Selective product certification cannot control the land use change triggered by growing overall biomass consumption. We propose a comprehensive approach to account for the global land use of countries for their domestic consumption, and assess this level with regard to globally acceptable levels of resource use, based on the concept of safe operating space. It is shown that the European Union currently uses one-third more cropland than globally available on a per capita basis and that with constant consumption levels it would exceed its fair share of acceptable resource use in 2030. As the use of global forests to meet renewable energy targets is becoming a concern, an approach to account for sustainable levels of timber flows is also proposed, based on the use of net annual increment, exemplified with preliminary data for Switzerland.

10.1504/ijisd.2015.068786	Integral design: The new roles for architect and engineers for developing nearly zero energy buildings	Improving the built environment is a cornerstone for sustainable development ultimately leading to Zero Energy Buildings; there is the urgent need for innovation. The urgent need for innovative and a more sustainable built environment has led to a more complex design process. As a result, the architect requires increasing support from specialised engineers in multi–disciplinary design teams. A design method was developed, based on the use of morphological charts and a morphological overview, to support design teams with structuring and organising their communication and knowledge. After testing the method in workshops in industry, it was applied at the department of architecture for master students for their multidisciplinary master project, integral design of a nearly Zero Energy Building. Our experiments showed that it is possible to stimulate the innovative outcome of multidisciplinary design teams within the conceptual building design phase by changing their traditional roles into new team's roles	['SDG07']

10.4314/wsa.v42i1.15	A preliminary investigation of the water use efficiency of sweet sorghum for biofuel in South Africa	Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) has been recognized globally as a potential biofuel crop for ethanol production. Sweet sorghum is a drought-tolerant crop that is widely adapted to different environmental growing conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the water use efficiency (utilisable yield per unit amount of water used) of drip-irrigated sweet sorghum (variety Sugargraze) under two different climatic conditions in South Africa. The sweet sorghum trials were conducted at Ukulinga research farm (University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg) and Hatfield experimental farm (University of Pretoria, Pretoria), South Africa. Field trials were conducted in two successive seasons, viz., 2010/11 and 2011/12. Seasonal water use was estimated using eddy covariance and surface renewal methods. Fresh and dry aboveground biomass yield, stalk yield and stalk Brix % were measured at final harvest. Theoretical ethanol yield was calculated from fresh stalk yield and Brix %. Water use for the two growing seasons was 415 mm at Ukulinga and 398 mm at Hatfield. The ethanol water use efficiency (WUE) values for the sweet sorghum at Ukulinga were 0.27 and 0.60 L∙m-3 for 2010/11 and 2011/12 growing seasons, respectively. The ethanol WUE estimate of the sweet sorghum at Hatfield was 0.53 L∙m-3 for the 2010/11 season and 0.70 L∙m-3 for the 2011/12 growing season. WUE estimates of the sweet sorghum crop were higher for Hatfield compared to Ukulinga research farm. The results from this study showed that the WUE of sweet sorghum was sensitive to plant density. The WUE values confirm that sweet sorghum has high WUE under different climatic conditions	['SDG07']

10.2298/tsci151215081b	Energy management strategies for combined heat and electric power micro-grid	The increasing energy production from variable renewable energy sources such    as wind and solar has resulted in several challenges related to the system    reliability and efficiency. In order to ensure the supply-demand balance    under the conditions of higher variability the micro-grid concept of active    distribution networks arising as a promising one. However, to achieve all the    potential benefits that micro-gird concept offer, it is important to    determine optimal operating strategies for micro-grids. The present paper    compares three energy management strategies, aimed at ensuring economical    micro-grid operation, to find a compromise between the complexity of strategy    and its efficiency. The first strategy combines optimization technique and an    additional rule while the second strategy is based on the pure optimization    approach. The third strategy uses model based predictive control scheme to    take into account uncertainties in renewable generation and energy    consumption. In order to compare the strategies with respect to cost    effectiveness, a residential micro-grid comprising photovoltaic modules,    thermal energy storage system, thermal loads, electrical loads as well as    combined heat and power plant, is considered.</jats:p	['SDG07']

We compared hybrid miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef and Deuter ex Hodkinson and Renvoize) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) cultivars Cave-in-Rock, (upland type), Alamo, and Kanlow (lowland types) for biomass yield and changes in soil macronutrient levels and removal rates in a humid Spanish environment. Soil and plant nutrient and C levels were measured after each annual biomass harvest for 4 yr. Plant nutrient concentrations were multiplied by biomass yield to express nutrient removal. Yield ranking (4-yr mean) was miscanthus (17.6 Mg ha−1) > Kanlow (13.3 Mg ha−1) = Alamo (13.0 Mg ha−1) > Cave-in-Rock (7.7 Mg ha−1). Miscanthus biomass yield peaked in the third year at 27.0 Mg ha−1. The high yield of miscanthus together with its relatively low macronutrient concentrations and intermediate removal rates, indicate its advantages over switchgrass as a biomass crop choice. Alamo and Kanlow usually removed more macronutrients than Cave-in-Rock, suggesting a greater long-term fertilizer requirement for the lowland types. Soil C stocks increased by a mean of 2850 kg ha−1 over 4 yr at 0- to 20-cm depth. Phosphorus was the macronutrient most likely to become deficient after repeated harvests. Miscanthus and lowland switchgrass cultivars performed well in the Atlantic maritime region of Spain, therefore the choice of crop would rely on economics of establishment and long-term stand maintenance	['SDG07']
10.1108/ijccsm-02-2016-0020	The establishment of carbon trading market in People’s Republic of China: A legislation and policy perspective	Purpose This study aims to propose a set of institutional frameworks, as well as practical polices and steps, with a view to facilitating the establishment of a unified carbon trading market in China.   Design/methodology/approach Based on existing empirical studies and reviews of the socioeconomic contexts, this study followed a qualitative approach consisting of secondary data collection and analysis, semi-structured interviews to collect primary data and comparative analysis.   Findings The establishment of a national carbon trading market in China is a systemic and complex process which requires coordination among various concerned government agencies and supporting mechanisms. Currently, the development of a unified national carbon market has been impeded by the lack of coordination among local pilot programs, and there is no specific law passed by the People’s Congress or by its Standing Committee to regulate the emerging carbon trading market. It is of vital importance for China, in terms of both practical and strategic aspects, to take a gradualist approach in establishing laws and institutions to guide and support the development of its emerging carbon market.   Research limitations/implications This present study forms a part of a regional research project aiming to identify sound policy approaches for the establishment of a carbon trading market in China. Due to scope reasons, it focuses only on policy analysis and recommendations.   Originality/value China’s emerging national carbon trading market has attracted much research attention. However, little has been done from the perspectives of legislations and policies. </jats:sec	['SDG07']

10.1007/s10668-018-0195-y	Pollutant versus non-pollutant generation technologies: a CML-analogous analysis	[Abstract]: In this work, we apply the Modern Portfolio Theory and the Capital Assets  Pricing Model financial tools to a portfolio of CO2-emitting generation technologies under  diverse scenarios. We will calculate the efficient—in the sense of having the minimum risk  for a given level of emissions—portfolios frontier. The Capital Market Line (CML) is the  place where all the possible combinations of a specific efficient portfolio and a pollutionfree portfolio—made up with nuclear and renewable generation technologies—lie. In  Finance, that specific efficient portfolio is called the market portfolio but we will see that  in our case it lacks an evident meaning. Therefore, we will explain which should be the  reference portfolio for power generation planning analysis. Anyway, the fact is that those  combinations are less pollutant than the portfolios in the efficient frontier. Thus, a policymaker can analyse which is their effect on emissions reduction. We will start analysing  the efficient pollutant generation portfolios. Then, we will introduce the CML-analogous  lines (CML-A) to allow the possibility of reducing emissions by combining an efficient  portfolio with a non-pollutant portfolio—this non-pollutant portfolio is free of both  emissions and risk. Results support the necessity of considering the carbon capture and  storage technol- ogy to achieve a less risky generation mix, with less emissions and  allowing a higher diver- sification due to the presence of cleaner fossil fuel technologies.  All of that leads to better levels of energy security	['SDG07']

10.1117/12.854591	Investigating dye-sensitised solar cells	SPIE Photonics Europe: Photonics for Solar Energy Systems III, 12th- 16th April, Brussels, 2010.At present there is a global concern of environmental issues and future energy supplies, for instance global warming and the rapid depletion of fossil fuels.  This trepidation has initiated a more critical investigation into alternative and renewable sources of power such as geothermal, biomass, hydropower, wind and solar energy.  The immense dependence on electrical power in today’s society has prompted the manufacturing of devices such as photovoltaic (PV) cells to help alleviate and replace current electrical demands of the power grid.  The most popular and commercially available PV cells are silicon solar cells which have to date the greatest efficiencies for PV cells.  The drawback however is that the manufacturing of these cells is complex and costly due to the expense and difficulty of  producing and processing pure silicon.  One relatively inexpensive alternative to silicon PV cells that we are currently studying are dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs or Grätzel Cells).  DSSCs are biomimetic solar cells which are based on the process of photosynthesis.  The SFI Strategic Research Centre for Solar Energy Conversion is a research cluster based in Ireland formed with the express intention of bringing together industry and academia to produce renewable energy solutions.  Our specific research area is in DSSC and their opto-electrical properties.  We are currently developing testing equipment for multiple DSSC and optoelectronic models which will describe the performance and behaviour of DSSCs.Science Foundation IrelandConference detailshttp://spie.org/x12290.xm	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.renene.2010.04.016	Biowaste energy potential in Kenya	Energy affects all aspects of national development. Hence the current global energy crisis demands greater attention to new initiatives on alternative energy sources that are renewable, economically feasible and sustainable. The agriculture-dependent developing countries in Africa can mitigate the energy crisis through innovative use of the available but underutilised biowaste such as organic residues from maize, barley, cotton, tea and sugarcane. Biogas technology is assumed to have the capacity to economically and sustainably convert these vast amounts of biowaste into renewable energy, thereby replacing the unsustainable fossil energy sources, and reducing dependency on fossil fuels. However, the total energy potential of biogas production from crop residues available in Kenya has never been evaluated and quantified. To this end, we selected five different types of residues (maize, barley, cotton, tea and sugarcane) from Kenya and evaluated their energy potential through biomethane potential analysis at 30 °C and a test time of 30 days. The specific methane yields for maize, barley, cotton, tea and sugarcane residues obtained under batch conditions were respectively 363, 271, 365, 67 and 177 m3 per tonne volatile solids. In terms of energy potential, maize, cotton and barley residues were found to be better substrates for methane production than tea and sugarcane residues and could be considered as potential substrates or supplements for methane production without compromising food security in the country. The evaluated residues have a combined national annual maximum potential of about 1313 million cubic meters of methane which represent about 3916 Gigawatt hour (GWh) of electricity and 5887 GWh of thermal energy. The combined electrical potential is equivalent to 73% of the country’s annual power production of 5307 GWh. Utilization of the residues that are readily available on a ‘free on site’ basis for energy production could substitute the fossil fuels that account for a third of the country’s total electricity generation. Besides, exploitation of the potential presented by the biowaste residues can spur an energy revolution in the country resulting in a major economic impact in the region	['SDG07']

In response, this article first surveys the academic literature on energy security and concludes that it is composed of availability, affordability, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. It then analyzes the relative energy security performance, based on these four dimensions, of the United States and 21 other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) from 1970 to 2007. Four countries are examined in greater detail: one of the strongest (Denmark), one of the most improved in terms of energy security (Japan), one with weak and stagnant energy security (United States), and one with deteriorating energy security (Spain). The article concludes by offering implications for public policy. </jats:p	['SDG07']

10.1115/1.4003291	The AQUASOL system: Solar collector field efficiency and solar-only mode performance	Water scarcity is a global problem that will be of capital importance during the first half of this century, when seawater desalination will often be the only way to achieve sustainable development. Despite significant energy efficiency improvements during recent years, seawater desalination is still an intensive energy consumer; therefore, in the current instability of oil prices and environmental requirements, the sustainability of this technological solution inevitably passes through continued improvement of energy efficiency of the physical processes involved, as well as the use of renewable energy resources such as solar energy. In 2006, the “Enhanced Zero Discharge Seawater Desalination Using Hybrid Solar Technology” Project (AQUASOL) concluded with the erection of a complete solar desalination facility at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria (Spain) for the main purpose of developing an improved-cost, energy-efficient multi-effect distillation (MED) solar desalination technology. The system was designed to make the following three desalination operating modes feasible: (a) solar-only: the energy to the first distillation effect comes exclusively from thermal energy from the solar collector field, (b) fossil-only: a double-effect absorption heat pump powered by gas supplies all of the heat required by the distillation plant, and (c) hybrid: the energy comes from both the heat pump and the solar field. In this paper, solar-only mode system performance is presented and discussed. Optimum working conditions achieved in the solar-only mode were in the range of 64–67°C of MED first cell inlet temperature, which implies specific thermal energy consumption from around 58 kW hth/m3 to 62 kW hth/m3 and a performance ratio of 11.1–10.4, respectively.</jats:p	['SDG07']

The focus of attention is on the experience of Canadian MMCs in Latin America, using as an illustration the particular CR response of one Canadian MMC at its subsidiary Guatemalan mining operation. Research suggests that home country factors play an important role in shaping corporate CR approaches in a manner which take into account the circumstances extant at subsidiary operations in developing countries, as do transnational advocacy networks and global normative instruments.</jats:p	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.rser.2013.02.047	Wind energy resource development in Ethiopia as an alternative energy future beyond the dominant hydropower	Over the centuries, energy has been supplied by wood, coal, oil and natural gas, as well as by uranium. All these energy sources are limited and create pollution problems. This has led countries to focus on a sustainable and cleaner energy sources. Wind energy is rapidly emerging as one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy with very significant increases in annual installed capacity around the world. In this paper, authors have tried to review the current state of wind power utilization in Ethiopia. First, a brief overview is given on the Ethiopian electric power sector in order to gain insight into the main energy sources of the country and installed electric power capacities. Wind energy potential and current energy policy in Ethiopia were discussed respectively in the subsequent sections. Finally, short reviews of the ongoing and planned wind energy together with other renewable energy projects are given. Ethiopia, a country that relies on hydroelectric plants for the bulk of its power, is now developing significant wind energy capacities. Lack of reliable wind data covering the entire country has been one of the reasons for limited application of wind energy in Ethiopia, but recently studies have shown that Ethiopia has substantial potential to generate electricity from wind, geothermal and hydropower. Considering the substantial wind resource in the country, the government has committed itself to generate power from wind plants by constructing eight wind farms with total capacities of 1116 MW together with a number of hydropower plants over the five year Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) period from 2011 to 2015. This development of wind power is a part of the current energy sector policy of the country that aims at a five-fold increase in renewable energy production by the end of 2015	['SDG07']

10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/015019	Methods for the quantification of GHG emissions at the landscape level for developing countries in smallholder contexts	Landscape scale quantification enables farmers to pool resources and expertise. However, the problem remains of how to quantify these gains. This article considers current greenhouse gas (GHG) quantification methods that can be used in a landscape scale analysis in terms of relevance to areas dominated by smallholders in developing countries. In landscape scale carbon accounting frameworks, measurements are an essential element. Sampling strategies need careful design to account for all pools/fluxes and to ensure judicious use of resources. Models can be used to scale-up measurements and fill data gaps. In recent years a number of accessible models and calculators have been developed which can be used at the landscape scale in developing country areas. Some are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method and others on dynamic ecosystem models. They have been developed for a range of different purposes and therefore vary in terms of accuracy and usability. Landscape scale assessments of GHGs require a combination of ground sampling, use of data from census, remote sensing (RS) or other sources and modelling. Fitting of all of these aspects together needs to be performed carefully to minimize uncertainties and maximize the use of scarce resources. This is especially true in heterogeneous landscapes dominated by smallholders in developing countries.</p	['SDG07']
10.1002/cssc.201200670	Photocatalytic CO<inf>2</inf> reduction using non-itanium metal oxides and sulfides	[EN] Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is by far the most widely used photocatalyst both for the degradation of pollutants and in the field of renewable energies for the production of solar fuels. However, TiO2 has strong limitations in CO2 reduction, particularly under visible light irradiation. The flat-band potential of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 is lower than that required for CO2 reduction and, therefore, it seems appropriate to develop and validate materials other than TiO2. In addition, the photoresponse of TiO2 requires photons of wavelengths in the UV range shorter than 380 nm and strategies to implement a visible-light photoresponse on TiO2 by doping have not been completely satisfactory particularly because of problems in reproducibility and stability of the materials. For these reasons, we focus in this Review on semiconductors other than TiO2 that show photocatalytic activity in CO2 reduction. Attention has been paid to the irradiation conditions to put the productivity data into context. The role of co-catalyst and heterojunctions to increase the efficiency of charge separation is also discussed. Our aim is to describe the state of the art in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction using materials other than TiO 2, trying to trigger further research in this area.Financial support by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Consolider Multicat and CTQ2012-32315) is gratefully acknowledged.

10.1146/annurev-polisci-062011-154926	Climate change politics	Within the past 25 years, climate change has evolved from an issue of interest primarily to some natural scientists into one of the top priorities on the global policy agenda. Research in political science and related fields offers systematic and empirically well-supported explanations for why solving the climate problem has turned out to be more difficult than originally anticipated. After reviewing this research, I focus on four areas in which we know less: (a) institutional design features that may help in mitigating or overcoming fundamental problems in the global cooperative effort; (b) factors that are driving variation in climate policies at national and subnational levels; (c) driving forces of climate policy beyond the state, in particular civil society, the science–policy interface, and public opinion; and (d) sociopolitical consequences of failing to avoid major climatic changes. The article concludes by identifying key questions at the micro, meso, and macro levels that should be addressed by political scientists in the coming years. In view of the fact that governance efforts at the global level are progressing very slowly, greater attention to bottom-up dynamics appears useful, both for analytical reasons (there is lots of variation to be explained) and for normative reasons. </jats:p	['SDG07']

The authors consider how these effects are influenced by climate change, to which urban areas themselves contribute, caused by their increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with rapidly expanding energy use. Other environmental and social factors are assessed, quantitatively and qualitatively, using detailed modelling of urban mesoscale meteorology, which shows how these factors can lead to large conurbations becoming more vulnerable to climatic and environmental hazards. The paper discusses the likely changes in meteorological and hydrological hazards in urban areas, both as the climate changes and the sizes of urban areas grow. Examples are given of how these risks are being reduced through innovations in warning and response systems, planning and infrastructure design, which should include refuges against extreme natural disasters. Policies are shown to be more effective when they are integrated and based on substantial community involvement. Some conclusions are drawn regarding how policies for the natural and artificial environment and for reducing many kinds of climate and hazard risk are related to future designs and planning of infrastructure and open spaces. </jats:p	['SDG07']

Design/methodology/approach                 – The paper discusses in depth the current status of grid electricity in Africa continent and suggested solar electricity as an alternative cost-effective method to the existing grid electricity problem in remote areas. An extensive analysis of the major contribution of solar electricity in various sectors such as economic, health, communication, social and environmental benefits is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion on how solar power generation can be developed.                                           Findings                 – The paper shows that in developed countries where ICT has been applied extensively, ICT offers increased opportunities for sustainable economic development and plays a critical role in rapid economic growth, productive capacity improvements, education, government, agriculture and international competitiveness enhancement. The paper has pointed out that ICT has yet to make significant impact in most African countries due to lack of reliable and adequate electricity. Solar electricity has been seen as the most cost-effective way of generating electricity, especially in remote rural areas, for ICT devices. For the widespread of solar power generation in Africa, various strategies have been identified which include training of qualified solar engineers and technicians, establishing PV markets and business modes, introduction of solar energy education in schools and universities, political leaders appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for rural communities, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs.                                           Practical implications                 – The paper shows that the problems of lack of qualified solar technicians and established PV markets and business modes (especially in remote areas), lack of solar energy education in schools have to be addressed before the benefits of ICT in Africa can be seen. Other issues include African countries appreciating solar electricity as one of the major energy component, lowering initial cost of the PV technology, availability of finance mechanisms for customers, import tax exemption and African countries regarding rural electricity as one of the basic needs like food, shelter and clothing. Overhaul of existing systems needs to take place in order to provide the means to deal with some of these issues.                                           Originality/value                 – Availability of reliable electrical energy remains crucial for development of ICT in rural African countries. Solar electricity is clearly one of the most promising prospects to the grid electricity problem in African countries because most African countries lie in the sunshine belt. The paper raises awareness about this in a unique way and suggests some novel measures about increasing the availability of solar systems for solar power generation. It is anticipated that the increases in solar power generation, especially in remote areas, will increase the use and application of ICT in various sectors.             </jats:sec	['SDG07']

The greatest potential for energy savings of nearly 40% lies in buildings. The Spanish building sector has developed several instruments for significant savings. The purpose of this study is to analyze those instruments and their effectiveness and efficiency. In Spain, energy efficiency in buildings is improving more slowly than in other EU Member States, but the new regulation will open a new opportunity to recover the lost years. However, the current economic crisis, demotivation of its citizens, decentralization of power in energy matters and the large stock of housing for sale, impede achievement of energy efficiency goal	['SDG07']

Considering China's particular circumstances and the purposes of energy subsidies, the perverse fossil fuel subsidies in China mainly concentrated on industries, and gasoline, diesel and natural gas consumption, which are always regressive. Other subsidies, such as those for residential electricity consumption and agriculture, should be kept for the time being. Results indicate that China's perverse fossil fuel subsidies amounted to CNY 509.22 billion in 2008, equivalent to 61.2% of total fossil fuel subsidies and 1.69% of GDP in that year. In addition, reasonable subsidies will not affect energy conservation and emission reduction. Furthermore, CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidy reforms. Our finding shows that removing perverse energy subsidies will result in a significant decline in energy demand and CO2 emissions, but will have negative impacts on the macro-economy. Therefore, supporting (or offsetting) policies, like carrying out other cost-benefit and sustainable programs with the revenues saved from subsidy reduction, are needed to alleviate the adverse impacts of removing perverse subsidies.

10.2298/tsci1403743b	Integrating the flexibility of the average Serbian consumer as a virtual storage option into the planning of energy systems	With the integration of more variable renewable energy, the need for storage    is growing. Rather than utility scale storage, smart grid technology (not    restricted, but mainly involving bidirectional communication between the    supply and demand side and dynamic pricing) enables flexible consumption to    be a virtual storage alternative for moderation of the production of    variable renewable energy sources on the micro grid level. A study,    motivated with energy loss allocation, electric demand and the legal    framework that is characteristic for the average Serbian household, was    performed using the HOMER software tool. The decision to shift or build    deferrable load rather than sell on site generated energy from variable    renewable energy sources to the grid was based on the consumer's net present    cost minimization. Based on decreasing the grid sales hours of the micro    grid system to the transmission grid from 3,498 to 2,009, it was shown that    the demand response could be included in long-term planning of the virtual    storage option. Demand responsive actions that could be interpreted as    storage investment costs were quantified to 1?2 per year in this article.</jats:p	['SDG07']

The role of institutions was also considered and included as an inter-mediating variable. This model was tested on a sample of 27 African countries, for the period 1996-2010. The systems GMM was applied for the empirical analysis. This approach was aimed at circumventing the possibility of reverse causality and endogenous explanatory variables-such as institutions.Findings– Trade and MNCs’ activities may not have much contemporaneous impact on the environment. However, their lagged values have adverse and significant influence on the current values of environmental challenge. This implies that environmental policies regarding trade and MNCs require time response lag. Energy was significant only at contemporaneous value but not at its lagged value. Institutional development helps to suppress the negative excesses (like pollution) from the activities of trade, MNCs and energy, and consequently reduce environmental pollution.Originality/value– This paper included the role of institutions in the environmental pollution, trade, MNCs and energy debate. Empirical studies in this regard have inadvertently excluded this variable, but have, at best, included it as part of policy recommendations.</jats:sec	['SDG07']

This paper presents a real-world application of the concept, and identifies viable policy options for achieving a complementary environmental regulatory framework that minimizes output and employment losses. The analysis utilizes macro level data from the Turkish economy, and develops an applied general equilibrium model to assess the impact of a selected number of green policy instruments and public policy intervention mechanisms, including market-based incentives designed to accelerate technology adoption and achieve higher employment and sustainable growth patterns. Overall, our results indicate that an integrated employment and urban greening policy strategy that combines a green jobs programme with a set of earmarked tax-cum-innovation policies towards R&D-driven growth, mainly targeted to strategic industrial sectors and agriculture, developing market economies can achieve significant reductions in gaseous emissions and urban waste while maintaining significant gains in productivity and employment. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.suscom.2014.09.004	Energy efficient algorithm for swarmed sensors networks	The file attached to this record is the author's final peer reviewed version. The Publisher's final version can be found by following the DOI link.In this work we are presenting the design of an intelligent hybrid optimization algorithm which is based on Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence to increase the life time of mobile wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It is composed of two phases; Phase-1 is designed to divide the sensor nodes into independent clusters by using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to minimise the overall communication distance between the sensor-nodes and the sink-point. This will decrease the energy consumption for the entire network. Phase-2 which is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is designed to keep the optimum distribution of sensors while the mobile sensor network is directed as a swarm to achieve a given goal. One of the main strengths in the presented algorithm is that the number of clusters within the sensor network is not predefined, this gives more flexibility for the nodes’ deployment in the sensor network. Another strength is that sensors’ density is not necessary to be uniformly distributed among the clusters, since in some applications constraints, the sensors need to be deployed in different densities depending on the nature of the application domain. Although traditionally Wireless Sensor Network have been regarded as static sensor arrays used mainly for environmental monitoring, recently, its applications have undergone a paradigm shift from static to more dynamic environments, where nodes are attached to moving objects, people or animals. Applications that use WSNs in motion are broad, ranging from transport and logistics to animal monitoring, health care and military. These application domains have a number of characteristics that challenge the algorithmic design of WSNs	['SDG07']

Generally, they can be subdivided by the direction of energy conversion. While the Peltier effect is used in solid-state refrigeration, the Seebeck effect is responsible for the conversion of temperature gradients into electrical voltage in energy harvesting systems. However, this paper proposes a novel approach to the use of thermoelectric couples, treating them as variable insulators in thermal systems. Here, we demonstrate that thermal conductivity in thermoelectric materials can be externally controlled by electrical parameters such as electrical load or DC voltage in passive and active systems, respectively. Active mode is a good solution when a complete insulation or a high control of thermal conductivity is needed. Passive mode permits a thermal conductivity increment of 1. +.

10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.071	Analysis of operating costs for producing biodiesel from palm oil at pilot-scale in Colombia	Desde del lanzamiento de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS), se ha revalidado la necesidad de una visión sistémica para la gestión integral de residuos y proyectos de generación de energías limpias. La producción de biodiésel a partir de aceite de cocina usado (ACU) en el contexto operativo de la ciudad de Santiago de Cali, debe examinarse bajo dimensiones de sostenibilidad, ya que es una solución que plantea múltiples ventajas potenciales para mitigar los impactos de la disposición inadecuada del residuo, contribuir al fortalecimiento de la seguridad energética, promover una cultura de economía circular y minimizar la contaminación ambiental. En este trabajo de investigación, se empleó un modelo de optimización, adoptando elementos tecnológicos que permitieron, mediante el desarrollo de un instrumento capaz de soportar los procesos de obtención eficiente de información basada en datos históricos reales y contextos específicos de operación de la ciudad de Santiago de Cali; modelar diversas configuraciones logísticas, con el propósito de evaluar bajo dimensiones de sostenibilidad, estrategias de abastecimiento optimizadas. A partir de las estrategias de suministro modeladas, se empleó un modelo matemático basado en análisis de ciclos computarizado que integra evaluación del ciclo de vida, modelado del costo del costo de ciclo de vida, análisis de consumo energético y un modelo de caracterización de impactos de punto medio; que convergen en un sistema de indicadores técnicamente sólidos y basados en ciencia, siguiendo el enfoque de dimensiones de sostenibilidad GBEP (Global Bioenergy Partnership). Los resultados teóricos obtenidos evidencian que, la densificación de puntos de generación de ACU, es decir, la concentración del volumen de biomasa en la menor cantidad de puntos de depósito posibles, representa un impacto preeminente en la eficiencia del sistema de generación de biodiésel, afectando en distintos grados los diferentes indicadores de sostenibilidad: utilidad operativa (rango del 50,66%); cambio climático (rango del 12,08%); generación de energía (rango del 19,48%) e impacto en la salud humana (rango del 1,09%). Así mismo, los resultados obtenidos muestran que, en comparación con el combustible fósil convencional, el biodiésel obtenido a partir de ACU tiene mayores impactos (negativos) sobre el cambio climático, la generación de partículas, la formación de oxidantes fotoquímicos, la toxicidad humana y el agotamiento del agua; considerando solo las fases de procesamiento. Toda vez que se consideran los procesos de combustión, los resultados evidencian que, el biodiésel a base de ACU en la ciudad de Santiago de Cali, puede contribuir de manera significativa a reducir las emisiones de GEI (Gases de Efecto Invernadero) en comparación con los combustibles fósiles; no representa una amenaza para la tierra y el agua; y puede contribuir de forma limitada al suministro energético de la región.Proyecto de grado (Magister en Logística Integral)-- Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, 2021MaestríaMagíster en Logística Integra	['SDG07']

Identifying responsibilities for biofuel innovations	Based on fieldwork and literature review we have investigated the rise and fall of jatropha cultivation in Tanzania over the last decade, and its negative socio-economic and environmental impacts. Based on the fact that the most vulnerable actors, small farmers, were affected the most, through loss of land and income, we conclude that biofuel innovations have so far been irresponsible. In this chapter we draw lessons for future biofuel innovations through the identification of stakeholder responsibilities. We do so by developing a framework which is based on current discussions on the meaning of ‘sustainability’ and recent ethical work on moral responsibility. In addition, we use the framework to reflect on the jatropha biofuel innovation experiences. Additional fieldwork will be done to gather information on visions and expectations and to discuss responsibilities for sustainable biofuel innovations in Tanzania. Our preliminary conclusion is that stakeholder participation and a clear demarcation of responsibilities are preconditions for sustainable biofuel innovations	['SDG07']

The analysis is carried out on HOMER II simulation software. Pakistan is one of those developing countries which are encountered with severe energy crises. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a technically and economically feasible system to meet the domestic consumer’s demand, as well as contribute to the central grid. HOMER Energy software is used to analyze different systems and to obtain the most reliable and feasible system for the customer. Simulation was carried out to find an economically and technically feasible system. Sensitivity analysis was carried out with hub height, PV De-rating factor, PV life, Wind turbine life. Change in hub height drastically affected energy production and economic prospect as the main factors of the system. Implementing such type of small hybrid systems on domestic level can be truly helpful to overcome energy shortage.</jats:p	['SDG07']

In the past, ICT was often regarded as a low-carbon enabler but its widespread adoption has adversely turned it into a power drainer. The negative consequence is climate change, which is a complex social problem with rebound effects on human beings. Taking cognizance of this problem, it is becoming vital for each and every computer user to contribute and reduce the growing carbon footprint of ICT. This work identifies and analyses the key contributors in diminishing the carbon footprint of ICT before investigating into the adoption process by end users via a proposed Knowledge-Implementation-Effect Cycle. The relationship between the key contributors and the adoption process by end users is studied via nine research questions to identify key limitations and finally recommend potential solutions to further help in reducing the ICT carbon footprint	['SDG07']

A target of obtaining 5% of the total energy supply from renewable sources was set, although it has not yet been reached. A lot of studies were carried out about potential technological, economic, social, or politics barriers to renewable energy development in Malaysia. Although important, there is a necessity for multi aspect investigation of these barriers. By applying a theoretical framework, this paper seeks to examine expert perceptions and understanding of the barriers to renewable energy development in Malaysia. This study shows that barriers to renewable energy cannot be explained only by one factor in separation. The results of this study indicate that, the intention to use renewable energy is influenced by the cost of renewable energy technology. From the analysis of the opinions of the respondents, it can be said that best way to overcome these barriers is that the government should play a powerful leadership. </jats:p	['SDG07']

Our research shows that the conditional convergence has been identified. Investment in fixed assets, government expenditure on education, health and infrastructure construction have positive effects on regional convergence of social development. Population weighted analysis of human development index provides support for weak convergence amongst provinces. Analysis of dynamics of regional distribution reveals the club convergence, which indicate two different convergence states. Central China is in the shade and lags behind, giving rise to the so-called “central downfall”. To solve this problem, the “Rise of Central China” Plan is necessary to promote the connection between coastal and inland regions of China and reduce the regional development gap	['SDG07']

Cities are not only responsible for environmental and health problems but also they hold the key for a greener economy and a sustainable future. Urban built environment is a policy field where appropriate policies and actions could yield significant human and ecological benefits. Among different elements of urban built environment, buildings deserve particular attention due to their large contribution to environmental and health problems. The concept of sustainable (green) building is a recent response to address the problems that stem from the building sector. However, the widespread implementation of the concept is hindered by significant challenges. This paper argues that manifestation of multiple benefits that sustainable buildings deliver could help overcome some of these challenges. The paper presents the extent to which green buildings could generate co-benefits, and underlines the opportunities and barriers to push green building agenda forward. The results indicate that green and sustainably renovated buildings could yield significant benefits in terms of energy and CO2 reduction, cost savings, and improved health situation for building users. The case study buildings with the best two performances are found to achieve 33% and 26% reduction in energy use intensity, and 38% and 32% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity in comparison to benchmark values. Reduction in energy consumption in the top two buildings corresponds to an energy cost saving of $ 1-1.5 Million per year per building. Furthermore, the top two buildings are found to provide improved healthy environment due to improved indoor and ambient air quality, better thermal comfort and more natural lighting indoors. Making more explicit the multiple benefits of sustainable buildings needs further consideration in this regard. We recommend that the public sector could take key actions to accelerate the number of green buildings including fiscal support, technical assistance and policy reforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.03.011	Modelling socio-ecological systems with MAIA: A biogas infrastructure simulation	Similar to other renewable energy technologies, the development of a biogas infrastructure in the Netherlands is going through social, institutional and ecological evolution. To study this complex evolutionary process, we built a comprehensive agent-based model of this infrastructure. We used an agent-based modelling framework called MAIA to build this model with the initial motivation that it facilitates modelling complex institutional structures. The modelling experience however proved that MAIA can also act as an integrated solution to address other major modelling challenges identified in the literature for modelling evolving socio-ecological systems. Building on comprehensive reviews, we reflect on our modelling experience and address four key challenges of modelling evolving socio-ecological systems using agents: (1) design and parameterization of models of agent behaviour and decision-making, (2) system representation in the social and spatial dimension, (3) integration of sociodemographic, ecological, and biophysical models, (4) verification, validation and sensitivity analysis of such ABMs	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.044	Review of biogas digester technology in rural Bangladesh	Bangladesh has been facing severe energy crises (lack of electricity and gas supply network) during the last three decades, especially in rural areas. These areas are characterized by their often inefficient use of woody biomass, mainly for cooking purposes. To avoid the resulting environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development, access to clean and affordable energy is essential. Upgrading existing biomass resources (i.e., animal manure, crop residues, kitchen waste and green wastes) to biogas shows significant promise in this respect. This article presents a review of the current status of biogas digester technology in Bangladesh with focus on households in rural areas, covering 75% of the total population. Currently there exists a substantial gap between technical and cost-effective potential and the achievable potential due to lack of technical knowledge, high installation and operation costs, feedstock availability and limited end user applications. As a result only one percent of the overall biogas potential, estimated at 14.5x106 m3/yr, has been achieved despite government programs for promoting digester installation. Via in-field surveys this review has identified problems in the construction, maintenance and operation of biogas digesters, particularly in overall performance of household digesters. Based on these results a number of operational and technology improvements are suggested. Three digester implementation scenarios are introduced, and performance and cost estimates are projected to 2040. The most ambitious scenario leads to a five-fold increase in biogas output as compared to today’s levels; levelized energy costs can be halved with proper choice of digester technology.QC 20160610</p	['SDG07']

Primary data collection was conducted in the period July–August 2011; semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions were the most frequent methods used. In total, 151 small-scale farmers from 9 villages participated in the survey. Ten factors influencing the dependent variable – level of technology used by farmers in combination with hiring of labour – were defined. The factors were statistically analyzed by ANOVA. The area of cultivated land and the educational level of both parents and children were found to be the factors limiting the process of animal traction or mechanical power adoption by small farmers in the Catabola municipality. In addition, a relatively high rate of child labour was observed. With the exclusion of childless families, 62.7% of small farmer families regularly use children aged 0–14 years for field operations. The results confirm that the factor of hiring extra labour is irrelevant in determining the development in technology use by small farmers in the Catabola municipality	['SDG07']

Forty-three entrepreneurs were interviewed in 28 developing countries and secondary information about country and regional conditions was analysed. We chose the Business Model Canvas as an analytical tool and the findings shed new light on established renewable energy business types. Three different types of businesses were identified – Consultants, Distributors, and Integrators; yet, there is also some overlap between these types. These business types appeared to parallel the life cycle progression of the business, but this requires further research. A key component of the study was to assess whether the types of businesses were related to country-level conditions to assess the impact of regional differences. These comparisons revealed consistencies between country-level characteristics and the entrepreneurs’ choice of business model. Conclusions suggest that different regions may support certain business models more than others due to differing levels of government interest in renewables, governance and policy support and the relative ease of doing business	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.114	Green electricity investment timing in practice: Real options or net present value?	Using data from 214 hydropower projects in Norway we study whether investors in renewable energy projects exert discretion about the timing of investment decisions. We know from interviews with these investors that they do not use the real options model; however, we would like to learn whether they act consistently with this approach. These investments were expected to be supported financially through renewable policy schemes, but were not during the time period we consider. We calculate subsidies implied by investors' decisions using both real options and net present value models and compare these expected subsidies with subsidies observed in a very closely related market (Sweden). Our analysis indicates that our assumed real options model implies expected subsidies that align well with the ones observed. If we assume investors used a net present value model, the corresponding implied subsidies are close to zero. However, we know from interviews with investors that they did expect subsidies. We therefore conclude that the real options model is a meaningful descriptor of the observed investment behavior.acceptedVersion© 2016.

10.1115/power2016-59242	Performance evaluation of a novel small wind turbine: UAE case study	A small personal use wind turbine (PWT) is studied and tested for power evaluation under different wind speed conditions. The wind turbine has small blades with FX 63137 airfoil. The blades are non-tapered and non-twisted to be economical and easy to manufacture. The blade span is 1.52 m which makes it small enough for personal domestic use yet big enough to produce sufficient power. The PWT size satisfies the requirements for rooftop small wind turbine for domestic power generation. The study is conducted in United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the PWT is installed in an open area to test under the natural conditions. Readings are recorded for wind speeds, generator RPMs, current and voltage for different timings and conditions. The PWT is tested at a variety of wind speeds to establish the operating range of the wind turbine. Using the calculated electrical power and wind power values, corresponding electrical efficiency is determined. Results are evaluated for electrical power and electrical efficiency against wind speed. The result suggests better performance and efficiency for continuous wind speed conditions. It also shows the PWT can effectively generate power under the conditions found in UAE.</jats:p	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.053	A review of multi-criteria decision-making applications to solve energy management problems: Two decades from 1995 to 2015	Energy management problems associated with rapid institutional, political, technical, ecological, social and economic development have been of critical concern to both national and local governments worldwide for many decades; thus, addressing such issues is a global priority. The main of objective of this study is to provide a review on the application and use of decision making approaches in regard to energy management problems. This paper selected and reviewed 196 published papers, from 1995 to 2015 in 72 important journals related to energy management, which chosen from the “Web of Science” database and in this regard, the systematic and meta-analysis method which called “PRISMA” has been proposed. All published papers were categorized into 13 different fields: environmental impact assessment, waste management, sustainability assessment, renewable energy, energy sustainability, land management, green management topics, water resources management, climate change, strategic environmental assessment, construction and environmental management and other energy management areas. Furthermore, papers were categorized based on the authors, publication year, nationality of authors, region, technique and application, number of criteria, research purpose, gap and contribution, solution and modeling, results and findings. Hybrid MCDM and fuzzy MCDM in the integrated methods were ranked as the first methods in use. The Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review was the important journal in this paper, with 32 published papers. Finally, environmental impact assessment was ranked as the first area that applied decision making approaches. Results of this study acknowledge that decision making approaches can help decision makers and stakeholders in solving some problems under uncertainties situations in environmental decision making and these approaches have seen increasing interest among previous researchers to use these approaches in various steps of environmental decision making process	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.013	A financial analysis of the potential of dead trees from the boreal forest of eastern Canada to serve as feedstock for wood pellet export	Global demand for forest biomass feedstock has increased drastically in recent years, mainly due to the implementation of policies and strategies for climate change mitigation and renewable energy production in many jurisdictions. The biomass from dead trees has been recognized by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a promising source of forest biomass for bioenergy at the global scale both because of its wide scale availability and its potential to limit global warming. In eastern Canada, dead trees are not only very abundant but are also widely perceived by lumber and pulp and paper producers as contaminants in the wood supply chain with marginal profitability. The general aim of this study was to determine the conditions of profitability of an eastern Canada independent sawmill (i.e., unaffiliated with a pulp plant) to produce pellets destined for international export using either co-products or roundwood from dead trees as feedstock. We compared the yield and monetary value of dead trees at various sizes and degradation levels for the production of wood pellets, alone or in conjunction with the production of lumber, to current market conditions. Our results suggest that using dead trees for lumber and pellets is almost as profitable as using them for lumber and pulp, with a difference of about 1–12% depending on tree size. Dead trees from all classes of wood degradation could serve as an interesting feedstock for pellets because wood density was only slightly affected by wood degradation. Small dead trees (DBH < 15 cm) could serve for all scenarios, as the difference between revenues and costs remained generally minimal between them. Larger dead trees did not appear to represent a financially viable option under current market prices, unless suitable subsidies or other types of financial support are provided. The sustainability criteria applied by European consumers could therefore be a determining factor for the future importance of dead trees from eastern Canada as a source of feedstock for wood pellet production	['SDG07']

10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.110	Wave energy device and breakwater integration: A review	One of the most abundant energy sources exists in this world is the ocean wave energy. By far, it has shown to be the most clean, renewable, predicted energy and has raised the potential to compete with the current use of non-renewable energy sources. Recent research conducted on wave energy invention has opened a new dimension to slowly reduce the dependency on fossil fuel by introducing new technology on the renewable world but relatively lacking in economical aspect. This review brings the latest status on integration of wave energy device with other marine facilities, which is the breakwater structure that may possibly aid to cost sharing. Most researches done on this field highlighted countries experiencing rough sea condition and focused less on countries with medium wave condition as faced by the Asian continent. The potential for energy extraction and wave dissipation for medium wave condition will be discussed in this review by considering several aspects including reliability, effectiveness and performance. Finally, this review shows that the integration opens up a new dimension to acknowledge the technology harnessing ocean wave, especially for the Asian countries experiencing medium wave condition	['SDG07']

Applying a socio-technical perspective to the cases of South Africa and Tunisia	Fossil fuel subsidies are a key barrier for economic development and climate change mitigation. While the plunge in international fuel prices has increased the political will to introduce fossil fuel subsidy reforms, recently introduced reforms may risk backsliding when fuel prices rebound − particularly if they fail to address the underlying mechanisms that create demand for low fossil fuel prices. Extant literature has mostly focused on the consequences of fossil fuel subsidies, including their economic or environmental impact, and the social contract that make their reform difficult. In this paper, we complement the extant literature with a socio-technical perspective of fossil fuel subsidies to explore the systemic mechanisms that often keep subsidies in place and how these mechanisms can be weakened. Specifically, in case studies of the electricity sectors in South Africa and Tunisia, we trace the socio-technical foundations of their fossil fuel subsidy regimes and the potential of renewable energy policy in disrupting this regime We discuss the relevance of our results for national policymakers wishing to implement and international actors wishing to support fossil fuel subsidy reform. In particular, we highlight that the socio-technical perspective of fossil fuel subsidies offers new intervention points for subsidy reform and that policy designs and assistance should strengthen technologies and actors that are most likely to destabilize the fossil fuel subsidy regime	['SDG07']

10.1039/c7ra04036a	Exploration of polyepoxysuccinic acid as a novel draw solution in the forward osmosis process	© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Polyepoxysuccinic acid (PESA) is a green corrosion scale inhibitor. When PESA is used for wastewater desalination in the forward osmosis (FO) process, the diluted PESA solution could be used for cooling systems. In our investigation, the effects of membrane orientation, temperature and flow rate on FO performance are studied using PESA as a draw solute. The results show that the effect of temperature on water flux is obvious, but the water flux increase is higher from 25 °C to 35 °C than that from 35 °C to 45 °C. Compared to the FO mode, the water flux increases faster in the pressure-retarded osmosis mode (PRO mode) at high flow rate due to the reduction of concentrative internal concentration polarization (CICP). Compared with polyaspartic acid (PASP) and NaCl, the water flux of PESA is the lowest under the same conditions. However, PESA has the lowest specific reverse solute flux (Js/Jw) at both membrane orientations. For example in the FO mode this value is 0.46 g L-1, whereas that of NaCl and PASP is 1.12 and 0.74 g L-1, respectively. This means that PESA has lower loss to the feed side than NaCl and PASP in the FO process, which greatly reduces the replenishment cost of the draw solute. The use of PESA as the draw solute in the FO process to treat dyeing water has the advantages of stable water flux (within 20 min), high dye rejection (nearly 1) and reversible membrane fouling (restored to 97%). The nanofiltration (NF) process indicates the good performance of PESA recovery with a high specific water flux (0.94 LMH per bar) and rejection rate (97.8%). Thus, the overall performance of PESA demonstrates that it is a promising draw solute	['SDG07']

10.1007/s11367-017-1362-3	Environmental performance of social housing in emerging economies: life cycle assessment of conventional and alternative construction methods in the Philippines	Purpose The environmental impact of the social buildingstock is relevant, particularly in emerging economies. Life cycle thinking is not yet established, however. Locally available, alternative building concepts could potentially reduce the environmental impact of the construction segment. This paper examines the environmental performance of Bas-built low-cost housing for an example of the Philippines, and the potential to reduce its environmental impact through use of three alternative building technologies: cement–bamboo frames, soil–cement blocks, and coconut board-based housing.Methods Life cycle assessment models are implemented andevaluated with software SimaPro, using the single-impact indicators global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) and the multi-impact indicator Impact2002+. According to EN 15978, the life cycle phase product and construction process (A), use stage (B), end-of-life (C) and supplementary information beyond the building life cycle (D) have been assessed. Theoretically calculated inflows from standard construction procedures used in phase A have been verified with 3 years of empirical data from implemented construction projects. For phases B, C and D, attention was given to servicelife, use-phase, allocation of waste products, biogenic carbon and land-use assumptions. Scenarios reflect the actual situation in the emerging economy. Processes, such as heat recovery from thermal utilization, which are not existing nor near to implementation, were excluded.Results and discussion For an assessment of the phases A–B–C–D with GWP, a 35% reduction of environmental impact for soil–cement blocks, 74%for cement–bamboo frame, and 83% for coconut board-based houses is obtained relative to a concrete reference house. In absolute terms, this relates to a reduction of 4.4, 9.3, and 10.3 t CO2 equivalents over a service life of 25 years. CED showed higher impacts for the biogenic construction methods coconut board and cement–bamboo frames of +8.0 and +4.7%, while the soil–cement technology was evaluated −7.1% compared to GWP. Sixteen of 17 midpoint categories of Impact2002+ confirmed an overall reduction potential of the alternative building methods, with the midpoint category land occupation being the exception rating the conventional practice over the alternatives.Conclusions It is concluded that the alternative construction technologies have substantial potential to reduce the environmental burden caused by the social housing sector. The service life of the alternative technologies plays a vital role for it. LCA for emerging economies needs to incorporate realistic scenarios applicable at their current state or belonging to the most probable alternatives to ensure valuable results.Recommendations for further research are provided	['SDG07']

10.1051/matecconf/201712008005	Small hydropower for renewable energy and water efficiency in Turkey	Because of social and economic development, the demand for energy and particularly for electricity is growing rapidly in Turkey. The main indigenous energy resources are hydro and lignite. Turkey has no big oil and gas reserves. Almost all oil natural gas (NG) and high quality coal are imported. It has a large potential for renewable energies. Hydroelectricity is well established as one of the principal energy-producing technologies around world, providing some 20 % of the world’s electricity. In the developing countries, the proportion rises to around 40-50%. The capacity of large hydroelectric schemes can be several times that of a conventional power station. They are highly efficient, reliable, and long lasting. Turkey has an abundant hydropower potential to be used for generation of electricity and must increase hydropower production in the near future. For these reasons, hydropower and especially small hydropower are emphasized as Turkey’s renewable energy sources. In this paper, to increase production of hydroelectric energy, some streams which are in the different basins in Turkey, have been analysed and some conclusions obtained from this study have been presented	['SDG07']

Both petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) and Labanah whey wastewater (LW) were used as substrates, and investigated for electricity generation and organic removal under batch mode operation. PRW showed higher bioelectricity generation (current and power generation of 3.35mA and 1.12mW at 100Ω) compared to LW (3.2mA and 1.02mW). On the contrary, higher substrate degradation efficiency was achieved using LW (72.76%) compared to PRW (45.06%). Superior function of MFC operation in terms of volumetric power density (PRW, 28.27W/m3; LW, 23.23W/m3) suggesting the feasibility of using these wastewaters for bioelectricity generation. Large sources of wastewater that generating in the Middle-East countries have potential to produce renewable energy from the treatment, which helps for the sustainable wastewater management and simultaneous renewable energy production	['SDG07']

We think that transmission investment is one key policy instrument amongst other to help with this transition. We propose an enhanced role for investing in transmission capacity for inter-regional trade to allow effective fuel switching among countries through a physically connected market. We develop a conceptual framework of ""Regional Energy Hubs"" and propose a cost minimization model in support of a transmission investment strategy that integrates: (i) a key geopolitical parameter for countries that are geographically close in a region but under different political jurisdictions, judged as stable and receptive to firm trading arrangements, (ii) an economic parameter related to the fuel mix where the differences in a country's supply and demand characteristics are significant enough for allow mutual benefits to be realized through cost reduction, (iii) an environmental parameter linked to a country's carbon intensity that could benefit from the resources of a neighboring jurisdiction with lower intensities, and (iv) a financial parameter for each country within a region capable of attracting investment capital.

10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.026	Energy and economic performance of rooftop PV panels in the hot and dry climate of Iran	Photovoltaic (PV) Panels, one of the more promising renewable energy technologies, are growing rapidly nowadays, especially in developed countries. However, these systems have not achieved public acceptance in some countries due to low energy efficiency and poor economic performance, especially in countries which are subsidized in energy tariffs. In this paper, the energy and economic performance of fourteen rooftop PV systems with the power of 5 kW in the hot and dry climate of Iran are assessed by monitoring the total annual energy production and simulation. The monitored data is used to analyze systems’ economic performance via Pay-Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Return of Investment (ROI) and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Results show that single array configuration systems have the maximum energy production while dividing the system decreases the production. Economic analysis shows that the average PBP is 11.6 years under actual price of electricity (0.21$), however it is 46.9–50.5 years under subsidized average tariffs. ROI values range from 2.6 to 3.2 with the average of 2.9 for actual prices. Under subsidized prices, the cash generated by investment cannot even offset the costs that the investment requires during its lifetime with NCF and NPV being both negative. Overall, the systems are not economically beneficial under subsidized average tariffs in Iran, which discourages private and public sectors to investment on these systems. Environmentally, each PV system can averagely reduce 500 kg CO2 emission in the first year of installation and fourteen of them can approximately reduce 1,613,900 kg of CO2 emission during life time of PV panels	['SDG07']

In this paper, the cooling tower-based thermally activated building system, which acts as an indirect evaporative cooling system, has been investigated using a computational fluid dynamics tool for the hot semi-arid climate of New Delhi. Three design parameters namely spacing, vertical position and arrangement of pipes embedded in the roof and floor were analysed for their influence on the cooling performance of the system. The results indicate that reducing pipe spacing from 0.3 to 0.1 m and moving the pipes closer to the inner surface from 0.135 to 0.015 m could reduce the operative temperatures by 1.6 and 2.7℃, respectively. For the same total water flow rate, a change in pipe arrangement from serpentine to parallel showed insignificant influence on the indoor comfort indices. The best combination of these three parameters can achieve an average operative temperature of 29℃, which is comfortable for the hot semi-arid climate of New Delhi where the adaptive neutral temperature was found to be 29.4℃. This study will contribute to heating, ventilating, air-conditioning designers’ understanding of the importance of these parameters for achieving the required comfort in buildings in India. </jats:p	['SDG07']

This paper shows the results of the evaluations carried out, through the internationally recognized Building Sustainability Rating Systems (BSRS), on different housing units built under this program. It was necessary to carry out a normalization criteria process (NCP) due to the particular characteristics of each BSRS and the complexity they presented in carrying out a comparative analysis.  Case studies indicate that housing developed by the FPHS obtained low qualifications according to internationally focused BSRS, with significant deficiencies concerning materials, energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and management. However, this study provides indicators of its possible integration in the social housing of countries with characteristics analogous to those of Mexico. Among all indicators, that those referring to the urban environment are capable of being integrated into the social housing.  Among the findings, some aspects of the FPHS evaluation process impede the integration of sustainable characteristics in Mexican social housing. On the other hand, the FPHS evaluation model, which gives priority to urban environment aspects above all else, may represent a new paradigm towards the achievement of the sustainable social housing (SSH)	['SDG07']
10.1051/matecconf/201815401007	Simulation of biodiesel production using hydro-esterification process from wet microalgae	Recently, algae have received a lot of attention as a new biomass source for the production of renewable energy, such as biodiesel. Conventionally, biodiesel is made through esterification or transesterification of oils where the process involves a catalyst and alcohol to be reacted in a reactor. However, this process is energy intensive for drying and extraction step. To overcome this situation, we studied simulation of a new route of hydro-esterification process which is combine hydrolysis and esterification processes for biodiesel production from wet microalgae. Firstly, wet microalgae treated by hydrolyzer to produce fatty acids (FAs), separated with separator, and then mixed with methanol and esterified at subcritical condition to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) while H2SO4 conducted as the catalyst. Energy and material balance of conventional and hydrolysis-esterification process was evaluated by Aspen Plus. Simulation result indicated that conventional route is energy demanding process, requiring 4.40 MJ/L biodiesel produced. In contrast, the total energy consumption of hydrolysis-esterification method can be reduced significantly into 2.43 MJ/L biodiesel. Based on the energy consumption comparison, hydro-esterification process is less costly than conventional process for biodiesel production.</jats:p	['SDG07']

10.3390/en11020398	Assessment of the joint development potential of wave and wind energy in the South China sea	The South China Sea is a major shipping hub between the West Pacific and Indian Oceans. In this region, the demand for energy is enormous, both for residents’ daily lives and for economic development. Wave energy and wind energy are two major clean and low-cost ocean sources of renewable energy. The reasonable development and utilization of these energy sources can provide a stable energy supply for coastal cities and remote islands of China. Before wave energy and wind energy development, however, we must assess the potential of each of these sources. Based on high-resolution and high-accuracy wave field data and wind field data obtained by ERA-Interim reanalysis for the recent 38-year period from 1979–2016, the joint development potential of wave energy and wind energy was assessed in detail for offshore and nearshore areas in the South China Sea. Based on potential installed capacity, the results revealed three promising areas for the joint development of nearshore wave energy and wind energy, including the Taiwan Strait, Luzon Strait and the sea southeast of the Indo-China Peninsula. For these three dominant areas (key stations), the directionality of wave energy and wind energy propagation were good in various seasons; the dominant wave conditions and the dominant wind conditions were the same, which is advantageous for the joint development of wave and wind energy. Existing well-known wave energy converters (WECs) are not suitable for wave energy development in the areas of interest. Therefore, we must consider the distributions of wave conditions and develop more suitable WECs for these areas. The economic and environmental benefits of the joint development of wave and wind energy are high in these promising areas. The results described in this paper can provide references for the joint development of wave and wind energy in the South China Sea	['SDG07']

10.3390/su10072483	Has economic competition improved China's provincial energy ecological efficiency under fiscal decentralization?	The study of environmental-oriented total factor energy efficiency considering pollutants as a non-expected output has attracted wide attention, but few studies have included social welfare into the above framework for analyzing China&rsquo;s provincial energy ecological efficiency (EEE). In addition, China&rsquo;s fiscal decentralization and economic competition have created tremendous momentum for economic growth; however, research has been lacking on whether they have improved China&rsquo;s energy utilization, pollution control and social welfare level. To fill these gaps, by applying the 2000&ndash;2016 panel data from 30 provinces and considering the social welfare condition, we use the slacks-based measure data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) method to calculate EEE and build empirical model to test the relation between EEE, fiscal decentralization and economic competition. The results reveal that, firstly, in the last 16 years EEE has been getting worse and the situation of the middle and western areas of China are poorer than in the eastern area, with the middle area still deteriorating further. Secondly, economic competition among local governments aggravates the provincial EEE in China, while the high degree of fiscal decentralization in state governments significantly contributes to improve the EEE; and the co-impact of economic competition on EEE has been negatively strengthened against the background of fiscal decentralization. Thirdly, the influence of economic competition on EEE presents a regional difference; economic competition makes the degree of EEE go down in the east and middle regions, while by contrast, economic competition has helped the EEE level in western regions. The conclusions point out that the temporal trend of EEE in various regions of China, and the economic competition actions adopted by most Chinese local governments to enhance their own financial strength, have not improved energy efficiency and pollution control capability, and has reduced the social welfare of the region. Accordingly, policy proposals are that the Chinese government can adjust the fiscal and tax revenue system and preferential tax system of the central government and local governments and curb competition between provincial jurisdictions	['SDG07']

Recently, a large number of organizations and enterprises have been supporting technological development, carrying out advocative actions, and offering finance for renewable energy. Concomitantly, there have been strong calls to improve coordination in this field. This article elaborates on the importance of institutional opportunities not only to favor coordination, but also to contest common wisdom shaping energy policies and specific project features at a given time. The result would be a more flexible renewable energy “governance dynamics” to provide the institutional framework for private actors and the interaction with public entities. Thus, three dimensions of global governance are analyzed: coordination, contestation, and the resulting process of collective/interactive regulation.</jats:p"	['SDG07']

This study explores the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption by means of the hypothesis postulated for the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). Panel data for ten countries, from 1971 to 2014 have been studied. Despite a wide gamma of research on the EKC, the role of an exergy variable has not been tested to find the EKC; for this reason, exergy analysis is proposed. Exergy analyses were performed to propose an exergetic indicator as a control variable and a comparative empirical study is developed to study a multivariable framework with the aim to detect correlations between them. High correlation between CO2, GDP, energy consumption, energy intensity and trade openness are observed, on the other hand not statistically significant values for trade openness and energy intensity. The results do not support the EKC hypothesis, however exergy intensity opens the door for future research once it proves to be a useful control variable. Exergy provides opportunities to analyze and implement energy and environmental policies in these countries, with the possibility to link exergy efficiencies and the use of renewables.</jats:p	['SDG07']

10.3390/su10124716	Rooting the future; On-farm trees' contribution to household energy security and asset creation as a resilient development pathway-evidence from a 20-year panel in rural Ethiopia	Most rural people globally cook with firewood or other sources of biomass. When biomass that has more productive uses is instead burnt, it is a sign of household level energy insecurity. Burning crop residue and dung for fuel reduces the availability of fertilizer and fodder, as well as directly contributes to poor health outcomes. Ethiopia is largely deforested, and now many of Ethiopia&#8217;s trees are on farms rather than in forests. The objective of this research is to investigate the relationship of on-farm trees to household-level energy security, rural livelihoods, and wellbeing. Using an econometric model with 20-year panel data from rural Ethiopia, we find on-farm trees contribute to building the household&#8217;s most valuable asset: their home. By contributing to household-level energy security, we find on-farm trees increase crop residue availability for maintaining the rural household&#8217;s second most valuable asset: their livestock. Large development efforts, including integrated water management projects and investment programs from the World Bank, are increasingly recognizing contributions of trees on farms, and environmental quality in general, as important contributing factors to meeting sustainable development outcomes. Asset creation related to on-farm trees and improved home biomass management provides a compelling pathway for building resilience, maintaining wellbeing, and reinforcing the foundation of rural livelihoods	['SDG07']

It content analysed the annual reports and stand-alone sustainability reports for the year 2013. Overall, the findings suggested that the adoption of GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and a country’s strength of law enforcement and commitment towards the environment had a significant influence on the extent of carbon emission disclosures. Other variables – environmental management system, environmental committee, voluntary participation in CDP programmme, corporate governance, and country’s legal origin – are not significant. Considering electricity industry and Asian region are among the main contributors to the global carbon emissions, there is a pressing need for the leaders within the industry and across the countries to institute mechanisms to combat climate change including through making corporate disclosures mandatory.</jats:p	['SDG07']

The concept of component part commonality, which derives from research on effective inventory management using material resource planning (MRP), can also be applied to human resource planning and educational resource management in higher education systems. Therefore, this paper proposed a systematic method to analyze student recruitment numbers for future needs, based on the concept of MRP. The research studied the relationship between a curricular structure tree and the associated commonalities. It explored the relationship between the commonality of students and the aggregated level of student replenishment. Based on that, systematic guidelines for curriculum design can be established for undeclared programs at collages.

Government policies are examined and reveal that heritage is seen by officials to serve multiple  purposes, not least as a tourist resource. Its economic role is appreciated, but awareness of sociocultural and political value is also apparent. Conflicts arise, however, between the demands of urban development in pursuit of economic growth and heritage conservation. The former tend to have  priority in decision making, which can lead to negative outcomes. Specific examples of historic waterfront properties and their transformation into tourism and leisure spaces are employed as illustrations which also suggest the dilemmas inherent in the adaptive reuse of old buildings. While  Singapore is a distinctive case, its study affords insights into general challenges of conserving built heritage in rapidly developing cities with a global orientation that are also international tourist destinations.</jats:p	['SDG08']

Debido al alto consumo de combustibles fósiles, el transporte terrestre automotor representa una parte importante del crecimiento de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero a nivel mundial. A su vez, se destaca por el alto consumo de recursos naturales, la generación de residuos peligrosos y vertimientos de aguas residuales durante los procesos de operación y mantenimiento. Para promover la sostenibilidad en el transporte especial, la literatura plantea el transporte verde como herramienta utilizada por los gobiernos en el mundo para gestionar los impactos; sin embargo, no se ha hecho de manera holística. Por lo anterior, en este estudio se plantea un modelo de gestión ambiental que permite desarrollar herramientas para prestar un servicio de transporte especial, bajo los principios de circularidad y producción y consumo sostenible en la empresa Transportes Especiales Brasilia S.A.   En el estudio, se utilizaron métodos mixtos recogiendo información cualitativa y  cuantitativa. A partir de esta metodología se ha desarrollado un modelo bajo los  principios de Producción y consumo Sostenible y Economía Circular aplicados en Colombia y otros países. Posteriormente, se desarrollaron estrategias y se dio inicio a la implementación de estrategias priorizadas para la puesta en marcha del modelo definido, logrando aprovechar aguas lluvias para la operación, la implementación de procedimientos para compras sostenibles y estrategias que permiten la reducción del uso de insumos y materias primas.Tesis (Magister en Gestión Ambiental y Desarrollo Sostenible)-- Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, 2023MaestríaMagíster en Gestión Ambiental y Desarrollo Sostenibl	['SDG08']

Mining and tourism in South Africa	This article looks at the mining and tourism sectors through the prisms of a society still attempting to redress the evils of the apartheid past. In so doing, it provides a typology of the dominant characteristics active in both sectors to upack the structural factors which oppress the precariats in these sectors. Precariats are the employees in a precarious situation in these sectors trying to eke out a living under extermely difficult working conditions. From the analysis, the common denominator in the two sectors is the low ‘slavery’ wages. The poor has not benefited materially from economic growth such that unemployment, poverty and inequality still remain as the country’s major challenges. The Black Economic Empowerment policy has been found wanting in empowering previously disadvantaged groups due partly to the co-option of black elites by white capital resulting in the maintenance of the pre-1994 concentration patterns. This article advocates a paradigm shift towards a system in which redistributive justice should be instituted, including a balanced distribution of power/control, resources, knowledge, capacities and benefits in these sectors for the benefit of all.

Foremost, the aim is providing detailed knowledge about the phenomenon of women self-employed chemists in R &amp; D sectors and throwing light not only on the single women but also on the general conditions they are working in and their opportunities to get ahead.Design/methodology/approach– The interdisciplinary research team followed an integrated research approach and combined qualitative with quantitative methods. By focussing on motives and causes of women self-employed chemists, this paper refers to the findings of two sub-studies, an online survey on self-employed (female and male) chemists in Germany and a qualitative study on the basis of biographical interviews tracing the professional biographies of women self-employed chemists. Moreover, the findings are analysed based on other sub-studies, like the analysis of the (start-up) conditions within the chemical industry and a discourse analysis of a well-known chemical periodical.Findings– It was found that the differences between female and male chemists turning self-employed or starting a business are less pronounced than the differences between male and female founders, in general. Research demonstrates that women chemists do have high qualifications and if they become entrepreneurs, the main cause for that is escaping their organisational employment. Being entrepreneurially active, women chemists might work more satisfactorily, at least they are able to surround the glass ceiling.Originality/value– This paper seeks to fill the gap of limited in-depth information on knowledge about female entrepreneurs and self-employed women with an academic background in chemistry. Focussing on one single field of study and profession of female entrepreneurs is, in that way, unique, as the research has looked on professionals who are not predestined for entry in entrepreneurship.</jats:sec	['SDG08']

More specifically, why do countries violate the Stability and Growth Pact, which is a cornerstone piece of legislation for the shared economy? Is it that violators simply have no other choice due to economic need? Are the violators intentional deviators that are simply able to violate the Stability and Growth Pact because of their power in the European Union? This article answers these questions and identifies those factors that are most likely to impact a country’s deviation from the two main clauses of the Stability and Growth Pact. The major finding is that it is economic need, not a country’s relative power, governing ideology or diffusion, that has a large impact on which clause will be violated.</jats:p	['SDG08']

It adopts empirical research to test the correlated hypotheses, and tries to put forward some policy suggestions.   Design/methodology/approach Social organizations are measured by four indicators in this paper. It proposes five hypotheses about the impact of social organization on economic growth and builds an economic growth model including social organization. The ordinary least squares and stepwise regression methods are conducted to estimate the economic growth model with the data from 1999 to 2015.   Findings Through the empirical analysis, it finds that the added value of social organization, human capital, investment and government budget expenditure affect economic growth significantly. The number of social organization at the end of each year has a positive significant effect on entrepreneurship, while the added value and growth rate of it have a negative effect on it. The numbers of social organization and full-time employee have significant effect on number to workers in the labor force. Only the number of social organization has positive significant effect on public education.   Originality/value This paper conducts an empirical study on the impact of social organization on economic growth in China and fills a gap of the role of social organization on the economy in developing countries. The results provide referenced information for public policy-making. </jats:sec	['SDG08']

10.3390/su10093201	Applying the SDGs to cities: Business as usual or a new dawn?	With growing urbanisation the sustainability of cities has become increasingly important. Although cities have been using indicators for a long time it is only in the last decades that attempts have been made to collate indicators into sets that reflect the many different aspects required to assess the sustainability of a city. The aim of this paper is to review the evolution of indicators for monitoring sustainable urban development in order to understand how ‘new’ the indicators suggested by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are for cities and the challenges they may face in using them. The review reveals that previous indicator sets emphasised environmental sustainability, health and economic growth. It is also shown that indicator sets that pre-date the SDGs lacked dimensions such as gender equality and reduced inequalities. In all, the SDG indicators provide the possibility of a more balanced and integrated approach to urban sustainability monitoring. At the same time, further research is needed to understand how to adapt the SDGs, targets and indicators to specific urban contexts. Challenges of local application include their large number, their generic characteristics and the need to complement them with specific indicators that are more relevant at the city level.</jats:p	['SDG08']
10.3390/su10124537	Adaptation strategies under climate change for sustainable agricultural productivity in Cambodia	Since the Cambodian economy is largely dependent on agricultural production, it is important to understand the effects of climate change on rice production, the primary staple crop of Cambodia. This study assessed the economic impacts of climate change in Cambodia to provide an appropriate set of policy suggestions that could lead to sustainable agricultural productivity and economic growth. The results from the GLAM-Rice crop model and various climate models indicate that Cambodia will be severely affected by climate change, which will lead to lower rice production and economic growth. The changes in rice yield under the RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 baseline scenarios reduced the GDP by 8.16% and 10.57%, respectively. By employing an investment model based on a real options framework, the economic effects and feasibility of adaptation strategies such as irrigation and adjustment of planting dates are identified. The analysis indicates that irrigation is a feasible option and the most efficacious strategy to reduce the negative impacts of climate change for the agricultural sector. The index of economic feasibility for irrigation, defined by the ratio of the current realized agriculture value-added to the identified threshold, is 0.6343 and 0.8803 under the RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 baseline scenarios, respectively. The results suggest that the priority choice for adaptation measure be in order of irrigation, 20-day later adjustment, and 20-day earlier adjustment	['SDG08']

The case of romania	The study aims to analyze the importance of renewable energy and to assess the progress made by Romania comparing to European Union and to targets set by Community institutions. We consider that both economic issues such as job creation or reduction of import dependency, but also ecological issues including reducing greenhouse gas emissions are important in discussions about renewable energy in rural areas in Romania. By using linear regression it has been identified a strong correlation in Romania, for period 2004–2014, between share of renewable resources in gross final energy consumption and import dependency. Taking into account that energetic independence is a problem of great importance for each country, the paper aims to identify unused renewable energy potential in rural areas and also opportunities for developing renewable energy sector based on the resources that can be exploited with high efficiency, action that will generate economic and social positive effects. Our results reveal that Romania has a high development potential of rural areas using renewable energy because Romania has a high volume of renewable resources (sun, wind, water). Under these circumstances it is necessary to adopt the policies in order to support projects referring to these types of energy.</jats:p	['SDG08']

10.1016/j.rser.2010.10.003	Hydrogen rich gas from oil palm biomass as a potential source of renewable energy in Malaysia	Oil palm is one of the major economic crops in many countries. Malaysia alone produces about 47% of the world's palm oil supply and can be considered as the world's largest producer and exporter of palm oil. Malaysia also generates huge quantity of oil palm biomass including oil palm trunks, oil palm fronds, empty fruit bunches (EFB), shells and fibers as waste from palm oil fruit harvest and oil extraction processing. At present there is a continuously increasing interest in the utilization of oil palm biomass as a source of clean energy. One of the major interests is hydrogen from oil palm biomass. Hydrogen from biomass is a clean and efficient energy source and is expected to take a significant role in future energy demand due to the raw material availability. This paper presents a review which focuses on different types of thermo-chemical processes for conversion of oil palm biomass to hydrogen rich gas. This paper offers a concise and up-to-date scenario of the present status of oil palm industry in contributing towards sustainable and renewable energy	['SDG09']
10.1002/er.1759	Fossil fuel sustainability: Exergy assessment of a cogeneration system	Thermodynamics plays an important role to perform the energy and exergy analyses of the industrial processes. The first law is widely used in engineering practice and is the basis of the heat-balance method of analysis that is commonly used in energy systems performance analysis. However, the second law involves the reversibility or irreversibility of processes and is a very important aspect in the exergy method of energy systems analysis. From the viewpoints of energy conservation and environmental benefits, cogeneration system can be considered as one of sustainable energies. The exergy analysis allows for improvements not necessarily attainable via energy methods, like increased efficiency, reduced fuel use, and reduced environmental emissions. From this point of view, in this study, exergy analysis of an actual Diesel engine-based cogeneration plant with a total capacity of 11.52 MW electrical powers, 9 t h (-1) of steam and 140 t h (-1) of hot water is carried out by analyzing the components of the system separately. The results show that 39.86% of the exergy entering the plant is converted to electrical power. The net steam production of the plant constitutes 8% of the total exergy input and the hot water production of the plant constitutes only 1.26% of the total exergy input. The remaining 50.88% of the exergy input is lost. Total exergy destruction in the engine is mostly due to the highly irreversible combustion process in the engine, heat losses from engine and friction. Small improvements in engine design and operation can provide better utilization of plant performance compared to large and expensive improvements in other components.

10.1016/j.exppara.2010.08.019	Teladorsagia circumcincta: The transcriptomic response of a multi-drug-resistant isolate to ivermectin exposure in vitro	The emergence and spread of anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematodes is a serious threat to the sustainability of the livestock industry. Resistance has a genetic component but the underlying mechanisms and the means by which resistant parasites survive anthelmintic treatment are still poorly understood. Differential gene expression may be implicated, especially in multi-drug resistant parasites. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic response of a triple drug-resistant isolate of Teladorsagia circumcincta to ivermectin exposure in vitro, using Roche 454 sequencing. The study generated similar to 100,000 new EST sequences, similar to 50,000 each from the ivermectin-exposed and -unexposed pools of parasites. Bioinformatic analysis of the expression profiles revealed statistically significant differences in the mean expression levels of four KEGG orthologous groups, namely 'translation', 'amino acid metabolism', 'carbohydrate metabolism' and 'xenobiotic degradation and metabolism'. Notably, candidate resistance genes such as p-glycoproteins and cytochrome P450s were poorly represented in both datasets. Clusters of sequences, containing both exposed and unexposed ESTs, also revealed statistically significant differences. Four clusters were identified as cytochrome c oxidase subunits, two of these clusters had a statistically significant increase in the number of exposed ESTs compared to unexposed ESTs. Four clusters were identified as vitellogenin; three of these clusters had a statistically significant decrease in number of exposed ESTs compared to unexposed ESTs	['SDG09']

These objectives of sustainability and efficiency attach great importance to the promotion of generic medicines. We have been working to promote generic medicines for many years, but since we started later than many of our neighbouring countries, we have not achieved the same level of use. However, we have a reference price system that enables us to set a maximum financing price for all medicines containing the same active ingredient and having the same route of administration once the innovator's patent protection has expired and a generic version has been launched. In the first half of 2010, the generic medicines market experienced significant growth in units, reaching a public market share of 26.02 per cent per prescription. In order to give them fresh impetus and continue working in this line of growth, a specific Plan has been adopted. This Plan emphasises the provision of information and education to citizens; the participation of community pharmacies in providing information to citizens and dispensing generic medicines; the provision of information and training to health professionals on their quality, safety and efficacy; and the streamlining of the marketing authorisation procedure and decision-making process on their public financing. </jats:p	['SDG09']

The national UK governmental Department of Health’s Research Governance Framework (RGF) for Health and Social Care requires that appropriate checks be conducted before research involving human participants, their organs, tissues or data can commence in the NHS. As a result, medical research has been subjected to increased regulation and governance, with the requirement for approvals from numerous regulatory and monitoring bodies. In addition, the processes and outcomes of the attribution of costs in NHS research have caused additional difficulties for researchers. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate, through three trial case studies, the difficulties encountered during the set-up and recruitment phases of these trials, related to gaining the necessary ethical and governance approvals and applying for NHS costs to undertake and deliver the research. METHODS: Empirical evidence about delays and difficulties related to regulation and governance of medical research was gathered during the period 2009–2010 from three UK randomised controlled trials with sites in England, Wales and Scotland (1. SAFER 2- an emergency care based trial of a protocol for paramedics to refer patients directly to community based falls services; 2. COnStRUCT- a trial of two drugs for acute ulcerative colitis; and 3. Family Links - a trial of a public health intervention, a 10 week community based parenting programme). Findings and recommendations were reported in response to a call for evidence from The Academy of Medical Sciences regarding difficulties encountered in conducting medical research arising from R&D governance and regulation, to inform national policy. RESULTS: Difficulties and delays in navigating and gaining the appropriate approvals and NHS costs required to undertake the research were encountered in all three trials, at various points in the bureaucratic processes of ethical and research and information governance approvals. Conduct of each of the three trials was delayed by at least 12 months, with costs increasing by 30 – 40%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the three trials encountered a variety of challenges, there were common issues. The processes for gaining approvals were overly complex and differed between sites and UK countries; guidance about processes was unclear; and information regarding how to define and claim NHS costs for undertaking the research was inconsistent. The competitive advantage of a publicly funded, open access health system for undertaking health services research and clinical trials within the UK has been outweighed in recent years by stifling bureaucratic structures and processes for governance of research. The recommendations of the Academy of Medical Sciences are welcomed, and the effects of their implementation are awaited with interest.

10.1155/2013/729525	Predicting subcontractor performance using web-based evolutionary fuzzy neural networks	Subcontractor performance directly affects project success. The use of inappropriate subcontractors may result in individual work delays, cost overruns, and quality defects throughout the project. This study develops web-based Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Networks (EFNNs) to predict subcontractor performance. EFNNs are a fusion of Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Fuzzy Logic (FL), and Neural Networks (NNs). FL is primarily used to mimic high level of decision-making processes and deal with uncertainty in the construction industry. NNs are used to identify the association between previous performance and future status when predicting subcontractor performance. GAs are optimizing parameters required in FL and NNs. EFNNs encode FL and NNs using floating numbers to shorten the length of a string. A multi-cut-point crossover operator is used to explore the parameter and retain solution legality. Finally, the applicability of the proposed EFNNs is validated using real subcontractors. The EFNNs are evolved using 22 historical patterns and tested using 12 unseen cases. Application results show that the proposed EFNNs surpass FL and NNs in predicting subcontractor performance. The proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and reduces the effort required to predict subcontractor performance, providing field operators with web-based remote access to a reliable, scientific prediction mechanism	['SDG09']

10.1533/9780857090201	Environment-adaptive antipersonnel mine detection system: Advanced mine sweeper	The chapter outlines the recent trends in humanitarian de-mining practices, analysing the shift from the concept of absolute need of full clearance to the recently developed idea of land release through technical survey. In this context, the possible use of lower-reliability technologies is discussed and the need to use more sustainable and appropriate technologies raised. The advantages of using locally available machines and agricultural technologies in particular and converting them to assist de-mining operations are outlined after having underlined how much science and technology can contribute to human development. The chapter then looks at the research on sustainable technologies for humanitarian de-mining being undertaken worldwide before presenting the efforts of the PMARlab of the Department of Mechanics and Machine Design of the University of Genova, working in collaboration with the not-for-profit association Snail Aid - Technology for Development. Recent results from PAT and Disarmadillo projects, regarding the development of a machine that costs less than € 5000, built around a powertiller, are presented, before introducing a new project called Locostra, co-funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development and the Italian Institute for Foreign Trade, that the authors are currently working on. The Locostra machine is built around a small off the shelf 4WD tractor equipped with radio remote control and blast resistant wheels. © Woodhead Publishing Limited, 2011	['SDG09']
10.1108/13581981011060817	Financial innovation and social welfare	PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to consider the case for regulating financial innovation in light of the recent global financial crisis.Design/methodology/approachResponsibility for assuring the bank customers are “treated fairly” in the UK currents belongs to the Financial Services Authority (FSA), whilst the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) oversees the Consumer Credit Act. The paper argues for the regulation of retail banking and financial service provision as a utility, leaving the FSA to concentrate on prudential supervision and the OFT to concentrate on its other responsibilities. Financial innovation in wholesale and investment banking should be regulated by the prudential authorities.FindingsNew financial instruments are frequently underpriced, which may be in part to encourage rapid and widespread adoption.Practical implicationsGood, transactions cost and risk reducing, retail financial innovation should be encouraged. New wholesale financial products should be thoroughly “stress tested” prior to being licensed, analogous to the testing of new medical “drugs” by the pharmaceutical industry.Originality/valueThe global banking crisis led to calls for banks to maintain lending to small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises and households (especially mortgages). This implies that access to finance, like access to water and electricity, should be assured and that customers should be protected against the “monopoly” powers of large suppliers. Hence, retail banks are utilities and should be regulated as such.</jats:sec	['SDG09']

High volume fly ash is used to partly replace cement and make the composite greener. Eco-friendly bagasse fibres from industrial waste and steel fibres are utilized to improve the mechanical behavior. In particularly, the influence of the parameters such as the sand/cement ratio and fly ash/cement ratio on the mechanical properties of the composite is investidated by evaluating the essential mechanical properties such as compressive strength and modulus of elasticity. The new green composite is found to be sustainable with high compressive. It is found that compressive strength of the composite decreases while the Young's modulus increases with the increase of the sand content, and that compressive strength and Youngs modulus of the composite decreases with the increase of the fly ash content.</jats:p	['SDG09']
10.1061/9780784412688.081	Efficient safety information retrieval on construction sites: A preliminary methodology	IT-supported field data management benefits on-site construction management by improving accessibility to the information and promoting efficient communication between project team members. However, most of on-site safety inspections still heavily rely on subjective judgment and manual reporting processes and thus observers’ experiences often determine the quality of risk identification and control. This study aims to develop a methodology to efficiently retrieve safety-related information so that the safety inspectors can easily access to the relevant site safety information for safer decision making. The proposed methodology consists of three stages: \ud \ud (1) development of a comprehensive safety database which contains information of risk factors, accident types, impact of accidents and safety regulations; \ud \ud (2) identification of relationships among different risk factors based on statistical analysis methods; and \ud \ud (3) user-specified information retrieval using data mining techniques for safety management. \ud \ud This paper presents an overall methodology and preliminary results of the first stage research conducted with 101 accident investigation reports	['SDG09']

10.1142/s0219649210002632	Information and communication technology (ICT) policy: A quantitative assessment for sustainable development	Four critical factors have been evaluated for their ranked importance and general effects on sustainable development. However, the main purpose of this paper is to quantitatively assess the criticality of ICT policy, and how related attributes affect sustainable development. One main hypothesis about the ICT policy has been tested, and the effects of the related variables and their interactions have been assessed. This research is carried out using surveys and interviews among a sustainable development community.  It has been found that ICT policy is critical for leveraging knowledge for sustainable development. However, ICT policy ranked the least important compared to the other three factors. For ICT policy to be successful in leveraging knowledge, it must be tailored to both organisation and national-specific Knowledge Management (KM) strategies. It has been found that there are no coherent frameworks for participation of community and other organisations in the international development community surveyed. The communication of indigenous knowledge into formal work, the inclusion of local content and languages, the lack of trust between organisations and the conformity with policies are found to be common problems in a international development community. Progress towards sustainable development requires a rigorous ICT policy, combined with strict regulations, to encourage Integrated Information and Communication Technologies Infrastructure (IICTI) investment, acquisition and usage.  This paper attempts to evaluate ICT policy on the mobilisation of knowledge for sustainable development purposes. It will be valuable for sustainable development decision makers to consider these findings as guidance for issues related to ICT planning and KM activities. </jats:p	['SDG09']

The results suggest that the market reforms in China have led to a reduction of workers’ bargaining power, which in turn explains both the rapid productivity increase and the steady decline in the wage share observed since the beginning of the reforms. The results also suggest that privatization, labor market informalization, and retreat of the state from social provisioning are key factors explaining the decline in the wage share. The current Chinese model of development, however, is unsustainable for economic, social, and environmental reasons, and a sustainable model of development is likely to require a more egalitarian income distribution.</jats:p	['SDG09']

10.1515/gps-2014-0055	A sustainable process for enzymatic saccharification of ionic liquid-pretreated cellulosic materials	A two-step sustainable process for the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic materials (e.g., crystalline cellulose, paper and corn cob) was evaluated. In the first step, pretreatment of crystalline cellulose, paper and lignocellulose by the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [Bmim][Cl], was carried out to obtain an amorphous substrate. This step included the recovery of the IL for further reuse. Then, the amorphous cellulosic materials were hydrolyzed by different industrial enzyme preparations. The pretreatment of cellulose, paper and lignocellulose (corn cob) with [Bmim][Cl] led to an up to 2.5-fold increase in the yield of the enzymatic hydrolysis, compared to the same substrate without pretreatment; this produced nearly 100% hydrolysis. The combined action of Celluclast 1.5L (cellulase from Trichoderma reesei) and Novozyme 188 (cellobiase from Aspergillus niger) was essential in the process of enzymatic saccharification of corn cob. By combining the enzyme complex Ultraflo L (β-endoglucanase from Humicola insolens mixed with arabanase and xylanase enzymes) with Celluclast 1.5L and Novozyme 188, the soluble sugar concentration was increased 1.5-fold, resulting in the best choice for enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic materials. The effectiveness of lignocellulose pretreatment with [Bmim][Cl] for improving enzymatic saccharification yield was also confirmed	['SDG09']

10.1021/sc500213j	Novel magnetite nanoparticles coated with waste-sourced biobased substances as sustainable and renewable adsorbing materials	This study examines the possibility of using bio-based product isolated from urban solid wastes as a material for environmental technological applications. To this end, Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated with different amounts of soluble bio-based products (SBO) were synthesized as low-cost nanoadsorbent for the removal of pollutants in wastewater. Particles of 10 nm diameter with Fe3O4 core and SBO shell were obtained. The concentration of SBO employed in the synthesis had no effect on the size and structure of the NPs, but ruled the pHPZC and aggregation of the nanoparticles in water. The cationic dye crystal violet (CV) was used as a model pollutant to test the adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles. The results indicated that both the medium pH and NP dosage were significant parameters to enhance the removal of CV. The results contribute to the studies which show how wastes can become a source of revenue through the industrial exploitation of their chemical value.Laboratorio de Investigación y Desarrollo de Métodos Analíticos (LIDMA)Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicoquímicas Teóricas y Aplicada	['SDG09']
10.14506/ca29.4.04	Muddy labor: A Japanese aid ethic of collective intimacy in Myanmar	Japanese aid has long been criticized for its focus on infrastructural projects, but Japanese aid actors have also valued non-infrastructural soft aid, especially through NGOs. Drawing on twenty months of fieldwork conducted with a Japanese NGO and its training program in sustainable agriculture in Myanmar, this article examines how Japanese and Burmese aid actors engaged in what I call an aid ethic of “muddy labor”—an emphasis on shared physical and relational labor that produced a collective form of intimacy. Scholars have tended to formulate humanitarian moral sentiments as responses to a distant suffering stranger. In contrast, I argue that the ideologies and political effects of a collectivist form of aid emerge in physical, relational, and geographic proximity. I demonstrate how the collective intimacy of physical and relational labor generated a meaningful sense of belonging among aid workers, while Japanese official discourses of soft aid indicated that this ethos of solidarity was also based on hierarchical views of Japanese superiority. The article ultimately asks how this ambiguity of the ethics of muddy labor challenges capacities for critique.</jats:p	['SDG09']

The evaluation of large numbers of diets in aquaculture species is costly and requires time-consuming trials in some species. In contrast, zebrafish (Danio rerio) can solve these drawbacks as an experimental model, and represents an ideal organism to carry out preliminary evaluation of diets. In addition, zebrafish has a sequenced genome allowing the efficient utilization of new technologies, such as RNA-sequencing and genotyping platforms to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie the organism’s response to nutrients. Also, biotechnological tools like transgenic lines with fluorescently labeled neutrophils that allow the evaluation of the immune response in vivo, are readily available in this species. Thus, zebrafish provides an attractive platform for testing many ingredients to select those with the highest potential of success in aquaculture. In this perspective article aspects related to diet evaluation in which zebrafish can make important contributions to nutritional genomics and nutritional immunity are discussed	['SDG09']

The strategies and push- and pull factors underlying the company’s innovation practices were investigated. The proposition that the institutional relationships formed to secure access to research expertise and aid business survival also influence the ways in which technology is commercialized was explored.                                           Findings                 – It was found that while technological development is company-driven, it is also highly connected to regional innovation structures and networks.

10.1016/j.rser.2015.03.076	End-of-Life of used photovoltaic modules: A financial analysis	The photovoltaic (PV) industry has a relevant role in terms of energy systems sustainability. The economic and environmental benefits related to its application brought the PV sector to an overall installed power of about 138 GW in 2013 (+24% compared to 2012).    The recent update of the European Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive classifies End-of-Life (EoL) PV panels as an electrical/electronic waste. Hence, it became mandatory to define alternative strategies to landfill [I]. The scientific literature presents different interesting technological solutions, together with related environmental benefits coming from the PV modules recycling. However, there is a clear fragmentation from an economic point of view [2].    The aim of this paper is to apply a financial methodology, like the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, for the assessment of PV modules recycling process profitability. This method goes to evaluate two main indexes, as the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Discounted Payback Period (DPBT). The Italian context is selected as a reference case study for the definition of an optimal plant capacity size related to current and expected national market volumes. To this aim, two types (pilot and industrial) of plants are proposed by the authors. The obtained financial results are useful to support future strategic decisions about the PV recycling management	['SDG09']

Hence, the maintenance activity is required in order to keep and improve the efficiency in the system. With the rapid development in networking technology, a need appears to change the manufacturing strategies. These new technologies improve the maintenance process, and establish remote maintenance (tele-maintenance, e-maintenance and m-maintenance). These kinds of maintenance try to provide personnel maintenance with the right information at the suitable time, which makes information available, anywhere and anytime. Our proposition is the use of mobile agent technology to reduce the maintenance costs and solve the problem of the unavailability of an expert in all phases of condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategy. The mobile agent technology overcomes a lot of problems and there is not much work that has used this technology. We have also used the web services (WS) to insure interoperability between machines and to support interaction over the network. Our approach gives great support to the maintenance engineer as it facilitates the access to decision-making support, work order, etc. which are available in the device like smartphone. This paper presents the development of a mobile maintenance support system based on mobile agent technology. The proposed system, the web and agent technology as well as remote communication were tested successfully. </jats:p	['SDG09']

The first part develops the theoretical foundation for linking sustainability strategies to organizational structure. The second part empirically examines the vertical integration level of 144 sustainability-focused companies in 9 different industries. The results demonstrate that sustainability-focused companies in the Health Care Industry and the Industrials Industry tend to have more vertically integrated organizational structures than their industry competitors that are not pursuing such a strategy since these two industries are production oriented and they have closer relationships with their suppliers. There was no significant difference in the vertical integration level of sustainability-focused versus non-sustainability-focused companies for the other seven industries studied. Research shows the linkage between environmental strategies and vertical integration has not been thoroughly examined.

10.4018/978-1-4666-2770-3.ch022	Cyber physical security solutions for pervasive health monitoring systems	With a rapidly aging population, the healthcare community will soon face severe medical personnel shortage and rising costs. Pervasive Health Monitoring Systems (PHMS) can help alleviate this situation. PHMS provides continuous real-time monitoring of a person’s health using a (usually wireless) network of medical and ambient sensors/devices on the host (patients), called Body Area Networks (BANs). The sensitive nature of health information collected by PHMS mandates that patient’s privacy be protected by securing the medical data from any unauthorized access. The authors’ approach for addressing these issues focuses on a key observation that PHMS are cyber-physical systems (CPS). Cyber-physical systems are networked, computational platforms, deeply embedded in specific physical processes for monitoring and actuation purposes. In this work, they therefore present a novel perspective on securing PHMS, called Cyber Physical Security (CYPSec) solutions. CYPSec solutions are environmentally-coupled security solutions, which operate by combining traditional security primitives along with environmental features. Its use results in not only secure operation of a system but also the emergence of additional “allied” properties which enhance its overall capabilities. The principal focus of this chapter is the development of a new security approach for PHMS called CYPsec that leverages their cyber-physical nature. The authors illustrate the design issues and principals of CYPSec through two specific examples of this generic approach: (a) Physiological Signal based key Agreement (PSKA) is designed to enable automated key agreement between sensors in the BAN based on physiological signals from the body; and (b) Criticality Aware Access Control (CAAC) which has the ability to provide controlled opening of the system for emergency management. Further, they also discuss aspects such as altered threat-model, increased complexity, non-determinism, and mixed critical systems, that must be addressed to make CYPSec a reality.</jats:p	['SDG09']
10.1115/es2015-49171	A framework for the development of technical requirements for renewable energy systems at a small-scale airport facility	Airports are key components of the global transportation system and are the subject of continuous sustainability improvements. Promoting clean energy sources and energy-efficient practices can help attain major sustainability goals at airports around the world. Although small airports are greater in number, most of the “sustainability” attention has been given to large airports. Small airports are typically located in rural areas, making them excellent candidates for renewable energy. This paper focuses on the planning and selection of renewable energy systems as a strategic method to reduce energy use and increase electric power reliability at small-scale airport facilities. The target system may use a combination of renewable energy sources to produce electrical power for the on-site facilities. The framework details include methods of energy collection, power production, and energy storage that are environmentally sound. A small airport serving a dual role as a flight training facility was used as case study. In the case study, systems engineering methodology was adapted to the small airport/ renewable energy domain in order to effectively identify stakeholders and elicit user requirements. These, coupled with industrial standards, relevant government regulations, and a priori constraints, are used to derive the initial requirements that serve as the basis for a preliminary design. The proposed framework also contains provisions for an on-site assessment of existing airport energy needs, sources, providers, and location-specific assets and challenges.</jats:p	['SDG09']

Myriad barriers to implementation exist. This study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of interface development between an SCP and an electronic medical record (EMR). Methods: An information technology application was developed to extract data from the EMR in use at our center (Epic). Data were transferred to autopopulate an Internet-based tool for creation of SCPs (LIVESTRONG Care Plan) that had been previously used for the creation of more than 35,000 plans. Results: Data (demographic characteristics, surgeries, chemotherapy drugs, radiation site) were extracted from the EMR and transferred to the care plan platform, without transfer of protected health information. Care plans were created and transferred back to the EMR. During clinical testing, SCPs were created by nurse practitioners during scheduled clinic visits for 146 sequential, eligible patients (67% breast cancer, 33% colorectal cancer). All patients received completed care for a single cancer diagnosis at our institution. All data points that were automatically populated were reviewed by practitioners, and missing/blank data fields were populated manually when necessary. Data entered into generated care plans were accurate in 97% of audited cases, and the process of care plan generation could be completed in &lt; 1 minute. Conclusion: This is a feasible solution for the autopopulation of SCPs from the EMR. It represents a future methodology through which widespread implementation of SCPs may be undertaken. Future directions include further clinical testing, assessment of provider-perceived usefulness, and integration into routine clinical care. </jats:sec	['SDG09']

10.1108/gm-02-2015-0006	“Wasta” and women’s careers in the Arab Gulf States	Purpose Women are under-represented in senior positions across the world, and this paper aims to explore the impact of wasta on women’s careers in the Arab Gulf States. This paper has two main objectives: to understand the phenomenon of wasta and how it manifests itself within public organisations in the Gulf region; and to examine how wasta is impacting on women’s career advancement.   Design/methodology/approach Qualitative interviews were conducted with 18 female managers working in public organisations in the Arab Gulf region.   Findings The findings indicate that wasta refers to a social network of interpersonal connections, rooted in family and kinship ties, and linked to family affairs as well as work. In addition, the findings demonstrate that, as a result of wasta, social networks in the workplace, in the Arab Gulf Region, include family connections, and this is different to workplace networks in Western societies which are frequently limited to professional contacts and separate from family or friendship networks. In addition, the findings show that wasta may be used to support women’s career progression, providing they have access to appropriate wasta. Furthermore, the findings revealed that women, in the Arab Gulf Region, rely directly on their male family member’s connections, as career facilitators, to gain access to organisational opportunities.   Practical implications The paper provides some practical suggestions for helping to overcome the potential negative effects of wasta and to ensure that organisations make the best use of their talent. Hence, this research could potentially inform national policy and organisational policymakers and, in particular, influence recruitment and selection practices to ensure that they are based on competence rather than personal connections.   Originality/value The paper is based on empirical work in an under-researched, non-Western context. There is extensive literature on gender and management and leadership in Western cultures, and this paper contributes to the developing body of research on women in the Arab cultures. It provides a better understanding of the phenomenon of wasta, and it highlights the long-term consequences of wasta on employees, particularly women, working in public organisations. Also, it contributes to theory on the culture of organisations by highlighting the often neglected influences of the broader social and cultural systems, including patriarchal practices, on women’s positions in the organisational hierarchy. </jats:sec	['SDG09']
10.1142/s0217590817400185	ECONOMIC IMPACT of SUBSIDY POLICIES to ELECTRIC VEHICLE SOCIETY in TOYOHASHI CITY in Japan - A CGE-MODELING APPROACH	In this paper, we explore the economic impact of promotion and realization of an electric vehicle society (EVS). More concretely, this paper emphasizes a computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling approach to evaluate the following issues: economic impacts of subsidies for promotion of an EVS, the possibility of price reductions, industrial structure change toward an EVS, and modal shift occurring toward an EVS. Our simulation results demonstrate that after applying 5–25% up subsidies to five industries, such as electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, EV transport, solar power, cogeneration and other transport, the total industrial output and city GDP increase. A large growth rate is found in industries where subsidies are introduced alone with non-ferrous metal industry. However, it is interesting that decreasing proportions are found in oil and coal product, mining, heat supply and gasoline vehicle (GV) transport industries. Moreover, all the commodity prices decrease since subsidies are given to some industries. Hence Toyohashi City’s economy shows a direction where the demand for conventional vehicles and energy use are decreased, conversely, the demand for EVs and renewable energy are increased illustrating a different life style from the current one. However, it does not mean that the total CO2 emission is decreased. EV society makes some industrial outputs larger. Due to the fact that some industrial outputs are increased, CO2 emissions of EV manufacturing and nonferrous metal are increased more than decreased industries. Thus, introducing 5–25% subsidies to EV manufacturing, EV transport, solar power, cogeneration and other transport can really represent a realistic alternative society to EVS if the total CO2 emission can be reduced. Therefore, we have to think what can make the total CO2 emission reduced. </jats:p	['SDG09']

10.1145/2448116.2448120	Interacting with social networks of intelligent things and people in the world of gastronomy	This article introduces a framework for creating rich augmented environments based on a social web of intelligent things and people. We target outdoor environments, aiming to transform a region into a smart environment that can share its cultural heritage with people, promoting itself and its special qualities. Using the applications developed in the framework, people can interact with things, listen to the stories that these things tell them, and make their own contributions. The things are intelligent in the sense that they aggregate information provided by users and behave in a socially active way. They can autonomously establish social relationships on the basis of their properties and their interaction with users. Hence when a user gets in touch with a thing, she is also introduced to its social network consisting of other things and of users; she can navigate this network to discover and explore the world around the thing itself. Thus the system supports serendipitous navigation in a network of things and people that evolves according to the behavior of users. An innovative interaction model was defined that allows users to interact with objects in a natural, playful way using smartphones without the need for a specially created infrastructure.           The framework was instantiated into a suite of applications called WantEat, in which objects from the domain of tourism and gastronomy (such as cheese wheels or bottles of wine) are taken as testimonials of the cultural roots of a region. WantEat includes an application that allows the definition and registration of things, a mobile application that allows users to interact with things, and an application that supports stakeholders in getting feedback about the things that they have registered in the system. WantEat was developed and tested in a real-world context which involved a region and gastronomy-related items from it (such as products, shops, restaurants, and recipes), through an early evaluation with stakeholders and a final evaluation with hundreds of users.</jats:p	['SDG09']
10.3390/su8080809	Sustainability and the tourism and hospitality workforce: A thematic analysis	This paper is about the position of workforce and employment considerations within the sustainable tourism narrative. The paper aims to address the relative neglect of this area within the discourse of sustainable tourism and highlights references to the workforce within the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The discussion follows the emerging field of sustainable human resource management and the contribution that this can make to meeting both the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to enhancing the recognition of workforce and employment issues within the related debate in tourism. The body of the paper highlights examples of key dimensions of work and employment across varied tourism contexts, where sustainability is of increasing consequence and significance. The paper concludes by drawing together the implications of these “mini-cases” and locating them within key principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development	['SDG09']

Economic and cultural development agencies intervene to support such remote and isolated communities but the significance of the dominant metropolitan paradigm in the peripheralization of those establishing and running businesses on islands needs critiqued. This article contrasts experiences but highlights similarities, rather than differences, of rural small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries and comparative Northern European locations. The key role of social capital, cultural values and norms is analysed and comment presented on small island experiences. Arguments are made for policies to be proofed for locational differences and for further research to understand the opportunities offered by islands and coastal communities in a world where the particularities of place and space are increasingly valued, and aspects of remoteness can be rearticulated to good effect.</p	['SDG09']

10.3390/su9010163	Positioning nuclear power in the low-carbon electricity transition	Addressing climate change requires de-carbonizing future energy supplies in an increasingly energy-dependent world. The IEA and the IPCC (2014) mention the following as low-carbon energy supply options: ‘renewable energy, nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage’. Positioning nuclear power in the decarbonization transition is a problematic issue and is overridden by ill-conceived axioms. Before probing these axioms, we provide an overview of five major, postwar energy-related legacies and some insight into who is engaged in nuclear activities. We check whether low-carbon nuclear power passes the full sustainability test and whether it is compatible with the unfettered deployment of variable renewable power sourced from the sun and from wind and water currents, which delivers two negative answers. We show that the best approach of the sustainable energy transition was Germany’s 2011 decision to phase out nuclear power for a fast development and full deployment of renewable power. This is the best approach for the sustainable energy transition. We offer five practical suggestions to strengthen and accelerate carbon- and nuclear-free transitions. They are related to institutional issues like the role of cost-benefit analysis and the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to the costs of nuclear risks and catastrophes, and to the historical record of nuclear technology and business	['SDG09']

An experiment was conducted on Facebook (R) with 500 employees from the top five largest banks in Brazil and another 100 randomly selected individuals. It was observed that bank employees are more prepared to avoid social engineering than typical Facebook (R) users; however, more training is still needed because an anonymous individual using social engineering techniques successfully infiltrated an online social network (OSN) used by bank employees and gained access to sensitive data. Moreover, by analyzing the banking reports and their policies, it was possible to identify the five main mechanisms of control and governance implemented by the FSI to protect data: (a) incorporate the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework into its model of cybersecurity governance, (b) establish policies that regulate the use of information assets, (c) establish a code of conduct for its employees, (d) develop a corporate security culture, and (e) maintain a corporate security department	['SDG09']

Development consisted of 4 processes: (1) determining the scope of the Claim Evaluation Tools and development of items; (2) expert item review and feedback (n=63); (3) cognitive interviews with children and adult end-users (n=109); and (4) piloting and administrative tests (n=956).ResultsThe Claim Evaluation Tools database currently includes a battery of multiple-choice items. Each item begins with a scenario which is intended to be relevant across contexts, and which can be used for children (from age 10  and above), adult members of the public and health professionals. People with expertise in research methods judged the items to have face validity, and end-users judged them relevant and acceptable in their settings. In response to feedback from methodologists and end-users, we simplified some text, explained terms where needed, and redesigned formats and instructions.ConclusionsThe Claim Evaluation Tools database is a flexible resource from which researchers, teachers and others can design measurement instruments to meet their own requirements. These evaluation tools are being managed and made freely available for non-commercial use (on request) through Testing Treatments interactive (testingtreatments.org).Trial registration numbersPACTR201606001679337 and PACTR201606001676150; Pre-results.</jats:sec	['SDG09']

10.3762/bjoc.13.84	The effect of cyclodextrin complexation on the solubility and photostability of nerolidol as pure compound and as main constituent of cabreuva essential oil	International audienceNerolidol (Ner), a major component of many plant essential oils, is known for its various biological properties. However, the low solubility of Ner in water and its susceptibility to degradation limit its application. The aim of our study was to improve the solubility and photostability of Ner through its encapsulation in different cyclodextrins (CDs). The formation constants of cis-, transNer and their commercial mixture with various CDs (α-CD, β-CD, γ-CD, HP-β-CD, RAMEB, CRYSMEB and SBE-β-CD) were determined by phase solubility studies and confirmed by the spectral displacement UV-visible method. The solubility of cabreuva essential oil (EO) rich in trans-Ner was also evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. The encapsulation efficiency (EE %) of Ner in HP-β-CD solid complexes was assessed by HPLC. The structural characterization of CD/trans-Ner inclusion complexwas then conducted by NMR spectroscopy followed by molecular modelling studies. The effect of encapsulation on the Ner photostability was also carried out over time under UVB irradiation. AL-type phase-solubility diagrams were obtained, suggesting the formation of 1:1 CD/Ner inclusion complexes. The solubility of Ner was enhanced by approximately 70-fold in the presence of 10 mM HP-β-CD. Moreover, high EE % values were obtained for 5:1 and 10:1 HP-β-CD:Ner molar ratios. NMR and molecular modelling studies revealed the most stable structure for trans-Ner inside the CD cavity with the OH group oriented towards the wider rim of the CD. Finally, CD encapsulation of Ner as pure compound or as main component of the cabreuva EO, protected it from degradation. This effect was more pronounced as the concentration of CD increased. These findings suggested that CDs are promising encapsulating carriers for Ner by enhancing its solubility and stability and thereby its application in food industr	['SDG09']

The results of the structural performance indicate that HDP containing up to 70% BFS and HDP containing 30% FA can be comparable in controlling the HDPs designed for highways and airports. Moreover, the results of the environmental impact assessment indicate that the synergy of the by-product and warm water can reduce the energy requirement and CO2 footprint by 5.77%–56.54% and 8.16%–55.5% for the highway and airport HDPs, respectively. Although the elevated curing temperature improves the structural performance and sustainability of the concrete pavements, any delay in concrete production increases energy consumption accordingly. Moreover, a new parameter (∇TE), which is the time gradient per unit energy consumption developed based on the Laplace transformation, is proposed to characterize the effect of the time delay in concrete production. This parameter indicates that the time required for a unit energy consumption (1 TJ) decreases by 50%, as the curing temperature increases. In conclusion, analysis of the structural design, carbon footprint, and the results of ∇TE indicate that 35 Â°C can be proposed as the optimum water curing temperature for the HDP incorporating by-products	['SDG09']

Design/methodology/approach – This is a case study that uses literature review as an exploratory framework for new approaches while reflecting on existing literature to present the current practical framework for using IRs. Findings – The digital environment has pushed academic institutions toward new strategies for curating their record on scholarship and preserving their heritage collections, using their IRs. Innovative approaches are also vital to curating the IR content digitally to facilitate access to those contents in ways that was not possible a few decades ago. Surveys and existing literature point to increasing uses of IRs despite abstinence from considering open access for scholarly activity among faculty concerned about copyright, plagiarism and sustainability. Staffing and funding IR initiatives are important factors in sustaining the curation of scholarship in the digital environment. Practical implications – IRs with open access publishing, expert gallery and digital library features place academic libraries in a central role as partners in digital scholarship.

10.1080/20421338.2017.1366132	Socio-economic and environmental analysis of wind power projects as viable renewable energy resources in Kenya	The demand for power in Kenya is on the increase with the ongoing growth of the country’s economy. There is a need for the country to balance energy efficiency, sustainability and low-carbon technologies. This entails drafting and implementing policies and strategies towards a low-carbon development path, ranging from fuels, technologies and infrastructure. This work examines the drivers of renewable energy resources in Kenya, focusing on Ngong Wind Farm. Results show that most low-carbon innovations in Kenya are driven by government tariffs and policies. Funding, and political and community goodwill remarkably influence the success of wind power projects in Kenya. The case study is a novel experiment that offers sustainable alternatives in the energy sector. There is need for more investment in the renewable sector, especially in the set up of power plants and power storage. To address the shortcomings in the renewable energy sector, there is a need for further research and development, and collaborations to foster innovations in the wind power sector in country. A combination of knowledge and resources, and leveraging local and national policies are potential ways in which institutional platforms can foster wind technology advancement and dissemination	['SDG09']

10.18517/ijaseit.7.5.2278	Macro-factor affecting the electricity load demand in power system	As Malaysia moves forward as a developed country, it is expected that electricity consumption will be increased when the economy, population and industry are growing. Therefore, this paper presents an analysis on the Macro-Factors such as geographical parameters, meteorological parameters, and economic parameters that affected the electricity load demand. A simple model is presented using correlation coefficient as a tool. On top of it, Johor Bahru and Skudai have been selected as a case study in this research due to the higher electricity demand in Johor. The result indicated that the economic element known as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population and maximum temperature were the factors that significantly affected the electrical load demand. Furthermore, this finding will be useful for researchers in the same area as a reference for their research works and it is also advantageous for the electrical utility for optimum operational planning in the future	['SDG09']

10.1177/0972150917713371	Climate Change Strategic Actions in the International Banking Industry	This article investigates the actions of international banks related to climate change adaptation. A theoretical framework was developed to assess bank climate change strategic actions based on five categories: management commitment, emissions reduction, product development, organizational involvement and external relationship development. A sample of international banks from 15 countries in four regions was analysed. Significant differences were found in the level of climate change strategic actions by banks across regions. North American banks had the highest scores on management commitment and product development. Australian banks were the top performers in external relationship development. European banks were ranked first in emissions reduction. Asian banks received the lowest score in all the categories of climate change strategic actions. The research is a unique comparative exploratory study of the strategic actions taken to address climate change in the international banking industry. The theoretical contribution of this article is its link between the theory of organizational adaptation and the climate change actions that banks practice. The research is beneficial for bank executives to develop effective environmental actions that will increase climate change mitigation and adaptation globally but particularly in Asia, which is the critical region for climate change actions. </jats:p	['SDG09']

LAB provide a natural way to produce safe, sustainable, and environmentally friendly products for a variety of industries. Product innovation is a key requirement for these industries to survive and grow globally. However, the development of new products may be affected by two man-made constraints; the Nagoya Protocol on benefit sharing and the opposition to the use of modern biotechnology for strain improvement.

10.1145/3150224	HPC cloud for scientific and business applications: Taxonomy, vision, and research challenges	High performance computing (HPC) clouds are becoming an alternative to on-premise clusters for executing scientific applications and business analytics services. Most research efforts in HPC cloud aim to understand the cost benefit of moving resource-intensive applications from on-premise environments to public cloud platforms. Industry trends show that hybrid environments are the natural path to get the best of the on-premise and cloud resources—steady (and sensitive) workloads can run on on-premise resources and peak demand can leverage remote resources in a pay-as-you-go manner. Nevertheless, there are plenty of questions to be answered in HPC cloud, which range from how to extract the best performance of an unknown underlying platform to what services are essential to make its usage easier. Moreover, the discussion on the right pricing and contractual models to fit small and large users is relevant for the sustainability of HPC clouds. This article brings a survey and taxonomy of efforts in HPC cloud and a vision on what we believe is ahead of us, including a set of research challenges that, once tackled, can help advance businesses and scientific discoveries. This becomes particularly relevant due to the fast increasing wave of new HPC applications coming from big data and artificial intelligence	['SDG09']
10.1186/s12884-017-1655-3	Factors influencing access of pregnant women and their infants to their local healthcare system: A prospective, multi-centre, observational study	CITATION: Madhi, S. A., et al. 2018. Factors influencing access of pregnant women and their infants to their local healthcare system : a prospective, multi-centre, observational study. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, 18:29, doi:10.1186/s12884-017-1655-3.The original publication is available at https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.comBackground:    The successful implementation of maternal vaccination relies on results of clinical trials, considering the prenatal and postnatal attendance at selected healthcare institutions. This study evaluated factors influencing maternal/infant access to healthcare facilities to identify potential barriers to participation in future clinical trials on maternal vaccination.  Methods    In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women (N = 3243) were enrolled at ten sites across Panama, the Dominican Republic, South Africa, and Mozambique between 2012 and 2014. They completed questionnaires at enrolment, delivery, and infant follow-up (90 days post-partum) visits, including questions on transportation, phone accessibility, alternative childcare, gestational age at enrolment, delivery location, and health status of their infant. Logistic regression was used to identify factors significantly associated with return to study site for delivery or infant follow-up visits.  Results:    Among 3229 enrolled women with delivery information, 63.6% (range across sites: 25.3–91.5%) returned to study site for delivery. Older women and those at later gestational age at enrolment were more likely to deliver at the study site. While heterogeneities were observed at site level, shorter travel time at delivery and increased transportation costs at enrolment were associated with increased likelihood of women returning to study site for delivery. Among 3145 women with live-born infants, 3077 (95.3%) provided 90-day follow-up information; of these, 68.9% (range across sites: 25.6–98.9%) returned to study site for follow-up visits. Women with other children and with lower transportation costs at delivery were more likely to return to study site for follow-up visits. Among 666 infants reported sick, 94.3% were taken to a healthcare facility, with only 41.9% (range across sites: 4.9–77.3%) to the study site.  Conclusion:    Although high retention was observed from enrolment through 90 days after delivery, post-partum surveillance should be broadened beyond the study sites and additional follow-up visits should be planned within the neonatal period. The factors influencing maternal/infant access to healthcare facilities and the issues identified in this study should be taken into consideration in planning future clinical studies on maternal immunisation in low- and middle-income countries.https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1655-3Publisher's versionAuthors retain copyrigh	['SDG09']

10.1007/978-3-319-66517-7	Performance and civic engagement	The aim of this essay is to draw out practical ways for realising cultural agency within domestic and international neoliberalised contexts and in so doing pose a tentative answer to the question “what’s to be done - at home and abroad - given the overwhelming political consensus which actively and explicitly undermines our ability to generate cultural and political agency and play a part in progressive social movements?” The context is changing quickly. Our initial rationale for the Study Room in Exile was to think and behave beyond neoliberalist value structures, but since Brexit, the election of Trump in the US, the rise of the far right in France under the leadership of Front National and Marine Le Pen, and subsequent reported spikes in hate crime, our thinking and behaving becomes more ambitious. Cornel West opens his Guardian article on 17 November 2016: “The neoliberal era in the United States ended with a neofascist bang.”  In order to draw out what the Study Room in Exile has done to attempt to answer this crucial (if slightly over-inflated) question, the essay will be divided into two parts: the domestic and the international. In the section entitled ‘At Home’ Lena Šimić will provide the domestic perspective on the Study Room in Exile via a project titled The Women of Europe whilst Gary Anderson will take on ‘Abroad’ by reflecting on the digital audio project The Study Room in Exile at Green Park, Athens, Greece, a project organised in collaboration with Greek anarchist-activists and artists. The two events took place simultaneously in June 2016. The domestic and international perspectives are brought back together in the conclusion suggesting that, in the end, there’s much more in common between the domestic and the international than first appears	['SDG09']

10.1016/j.jom.2018.04.001	Developing country sub-supplier responses to social sustainability requirements of intermediaries: Exploring the influence of framing on fairness perceptions and reciprocity	Research on social sustainability in multi-tier supply chains is limited. Specifically, we know very little about a) the micro-processes involved in the way in which sub-suppliers (i.e., first-tier suppliers or sourcing agents) respond to the sustainability requirements imposed by their intermediaries; and b) the micro-level antecedents that condition their responses. To address these gaps, we used a longitudinal multiple case study method to explore multiple intermediary – sub-supplier dyads in South India’s knitwear garment industry and drew upon constructs of behavioural economics. We found that the way in which intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements and their associated procedures influence both the way in which sub-suppliers perceive the procedural fairness of those requirements and the way in which they thus reciprocate. When intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements as ‘opportunity’ and engage in various procedures perceived to be procedurally fair by sub-suppliers, the latter reciprocate positively. Contrastingly, when intermediaries frame social sustainability requirements as ‘insulation’ and engage in various procedures perceived to be procedurally unfair by sub-suppliers, the latter reciprocate negatively. Under the production-dominant framing, sub-suppliers exhibit positive reciprocity only related to processing production orders. Our analysis inductively generated propositions that emphasise the important role played by framing in shaping the perceptions of fairness held by sub-suppliers towards social sustainability requirements and the reciprocity of the latter’s responses to them	['SDG09']

10.1287/mnsc.2017.2757	Innovation, openness, and platform control	Suppose that a firm in charge of a business ecosystem is a firm in charge of a microeconomy. To achieve the highest growth rate, how open should that economy be? To encourage third-party developers, how long should their intellectual property interests last? We develop a sequential innovation model that addresses the trade-offs inherent in these two decisions: (i) Closing the platform increases the sponsor’s ability to charge for access, while opening the platform increases developer ability to build upon it. (ii) The longer third-party developers retain rights to their innovations, the higher the royalties they and the sponsor earn, but the sooner those developers’ rights expire, the sooner their innovations become a public good upon which other developers can build. Our model allows us to characterize the optimal levels of openness and of intellectual property (IP) duration in a platform ecosystem. We use standard Cobb–Douglas production technologies to derive our results. These findings can inform innovation strategy, choice of organizational form, IP noncompete decisions, and regulation policy.

10.1186/s12978-018-0553-0	Barriers and facilitators to institutional delivery in rural areas of Chitwan district, Nepal: A qualitative study	Abstract Background Giving birth assisted by skilled care in a health facility plays a vital role in preventing maternal deaths. In Nepal, delivery services are free and a cash incentive is provided to women giving birth at a health facility. Nevertheless, about half of women still deliver at home. This study explores socio-cultural and health service-related barriers to and facilitators of institutional delivery. Methods Six village development committees in hill and plain areas were selected in Chitwan district. We conducted a total of 10 focus group discussions and 12 in-depth-interviews with relevant stakeholder groups, including mothers, husbands, mothers-in-law, traditional birth attendants, female community health volunteers, health service providers and district health managers. Data were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis. Results Three main themes played a role in deciding the place of delivery, i.e. socio-cultural norms and values; access to birthing facilities; and perceptions regarding the quality of health services. Factors encouraging an institutional delivery included complications during labour, supportive husbands and mothers-in-law, the availability of an ambulance, having birthing centres nearby, locally sufficient financial incentives and/or material incentives, the 24-h availability of midwives and friendly health service providers. Socio-cultural barriers to institutional deliveries were deeply held beliefs about childbirth being a normal life event, the wish to be cared for by family members, greater freedom of movement at home, a warm environment, the possibility to obtain appropriate “hot” foods, and shyness of young women and their position in the family hierarchy. Accessibility and quality of health services also presented barriers, including lack of road and transportation, insufficient financial incentives, poor infrastructure and equipment at birthing centres and the young age and perceived incompetence of midwives. Conclusion Despite much progress in recent years, this study revealed some important barriers to the utilization of health services. It suggests that a combination of upgrading birthing centres and strengthening the competencies of health personnel while embracing and addressing deeply rooted family values and traditions can improve existing programmes and further increase institutional delivery rates	['SDG09']

Engagement in a process of systematic problem-solving arguably builds the kind of complex understanding of the real-world workplace that inoculates against praxis shock. This chapter addresses the problem by demonstrating how the utilization of simple technologies as learning tools can enhance the quality of the teacher education process. The Mobile Technologies Project encapsulates a two-way process of having future teachers become comfortable with new technologies, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will use them effectively in their classrooms.

10.1051/matecconf/201819504020	Control of urban parking based on zoning rates in the context of sustainable transportation	Urban parking is a major challenge in several developing countries such as Indonesia. Dense traffic conditions are exacerbated by the lack of availability of off-street parking in public spaces, forcing vehicles to use on-street parking, which in turn impedes traffic flow and causes gridlock and traffic jams. Semarang City is a good case-study area, with significant parking problems which are clearly unresolved. The research objective is to develop urban parking controls by conducting a comprehensive parking rate analysis based on zoning, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to direct and refine the research in a methodical way. The research results determined appropriate urban parking rates based not simply on zoning, but also accounting for the influence of additional quantifiable criteria: assessed land value, location and accessibility, additional value derived from various types of land use, economic capability/ability to pay, and hidden value ascribed to amenities/type of facilities. The highest weighted value, 8,498, was obtained for zone A, which represents the trade zone (BWK 1/Urban Boundaries 1); the value obtained for zone B, 3,71, represents the industrial zone (BWK 4/Urban Boundaries 4); and zone C (BWK 6/Urban Boundaries 6) is represented with the weighted value of 1,867	['SDG09']

10.3390/su10113851	Remote sensing detection of vegetation and landform damages by coal mining on the Tibetan Plateau	In order to satisfy the needs of constant economic growth, the pressure to exploit natural resources has been increasing rapidly in China. Particularly with the implementation of the National Western Development Strategies since 1999, more and more mining activities and related infrastructure constructions have been conducted on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Mining activities are known to have substantial impacts on plant dynamics and hence the water and energy cycles. Identifying mining activities and quantifying their effects on vegetation cover are critical to the monitoring and protection of the pristine TP environment. Thus, this study aims to develop an automated approach that detects the timing of initial mining development and assess the spatial distribution of mining-ruined vegetation. The Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm was used to decompose the signal in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series derived from high-frequency MODIS images, and to detect abrupt changes of surface vegetation. Results show that the BFAST algorithm is able to effectively identify abrupt changes in vegetation cover as a result of open-mining development on the studied alpine grassland. The testing study in Muli Town of Qinghai Province shows that the mining development began in 2003 and massive destructions of vegetation cover followed between 2008 and 2012. The integrated use of Landsat imagery and multi-temporal DEMs further reveals detailed areal and volumetric changes in the mining site. This study demonstrates the potential of applying multi-mission satellite datasets to assess large-scale environmental influences from mining development, and will be beneficial to environmental conservation and sustainable use of natural resources in remote regions.</jats:p	['SDG09']

10.3846/enviro.2017.259	Experimental study of heat storage unit made of PCM-gypsum composite integrated with the ventilation system of the building	In the paper a special heat storage unit for building applications is presented. It has a form of a ceiling panel that is made of PCM-gypsum mortar composite and it contains internal channels for air flow, since it is designed as a part of ventilation system of the building. The panel works as a regenerative heat exchanger with phase change material (PCM) as a prevailing heat storage medium. When a melting point of PCM is properly chosen it is possible that air temperature flowing into the building reach a level corresponding to thermal comfort conditions, regardless the temperature at the intake. Warm air (during a day) releases heat basically to PCM causing its melting. During night time cool ambient air is heated up while it takes back heat accumulated in PCM. An experimental set-up based on the above concept was developed. A series of tests in different conditions (for variable inlet air temperatures, air flow rates) were performed. Information on thermal performance of the ceiling panel as well as detailed data on heat transfer process were obtained and discussed in the paper.</jats:p	['SDG09']

The aim of this article is to analyse to what extent secondary education in Spain prepares young people with learning difficulties for later inclusion in society and the labour market. Results from studies into good practices in secondary education have established which educational characteristics to take into account for pupils' transition to working life and the need for the school to lead this process. We contrast these results with the current situation in Spain by comprehensively analysing how current secondary education is facing up to the challenges of labour market inclusion for young people with disabilities. Following this, we propose guidelines for the improvement of educational practices in secondary education so as to foster opportunities for labour market participation, from an inclusive viewpoint, for young people with learning disabilitie	['SDG10']

Basing the concept “speech community” on Johnson and Milani’s description of such a language as “a complete and society-bearing language” and on Pavlenko and Blackledge’s notion of “a public”, it lists the obstacles which the development of an “inclusive Afrikaans community” need to deal with and discusses five issues which have to be debated in such a developmental process. The article also provides a brief overview of activities which the Afrikaans establishment have organised since 2003 (referring to them as “the third Afrikaans language movement”) to restore the language-political status of Afrikaans, and asks whether the emphasis on constructing an inclusive speech community is a creative way of addressing the problem with which they wish to deal.&nbsp	['SDG10']

The main aim of this work is to describe and analyse the discursive strategies interactants adopt in the co-construction of social identities at a popular radio show broadcast in Belo Horizonte (“Mistureba” – a Radio Favela program). This consists of a microanalysis work of discourse in the field of Interactional Sociolinguistics (Gumperz 1982, Tannen, 1984, 1989, Schiffrin, 1996). Data were obtained from recordings on audio tapes, transcribed, accounting for a total of 171 interactions or three hundred transcribed pages. The analysis shows that the social identities of addressees and radio announcers are built on a demonstration of social affiliation that is revealed, especially in the way they address each other, which claims inclusion in the group and lexical choices that reflect the use of a distinctive dialect. This work also made it possible to understand the ethos of Brazilian radio interactions which are defined in essence as a place of social “interaction” – in the words of Da Matta (1979), the “horror of distance” and the desire for closeness.Key words: language, identity, interaction, radio.</p	['SDG10']

10.1177/0266666911429489	Lending a visible hand: An analysis of infomediary behavior in Colombian public access computing venues	This paper describes the role of infomediaries, a particular function of public access computing (PAC) services that extend the reach of information and communication technologies (ICT) in developing countries. Infomediaries help PAC users and other members of the community meet their information needs through formal or informal training, support and service activities that result in better direct or indirect use of ICT resources. Infomediaries help foster digital inclusion and bridge gaps such as illiteracy, limited physical access to a venue, insufficient technology-operation skills, and income constraints. We discuss findings of an in-depth study of PAC in Colombia, South America, conducted by University of Washington researchers and local partners. Combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, we analyze the role of infomediaries in three types of PAC venues: libraries, telecenters and cybercafés. Infomediaries in PAC venues contribute to human development by enabling easier access to (1) information on education, health, government services and other social needs in the community (Social Impact); (2) information about jobs, employment, business opportunities, and agricultural resources (Economic Impact); and (3) information and communication resources to strengthen personal relationships and sense of belonging to a local and global community (Community Impact). This research sheds new light on the importance of the role of formal and informal infomediaries to strengthen the contribution of PAC to human development. </jats:p	['SDG10']

If statistical mechanisms also contribute to word learning, they must interact with these pro-cesses; however, there exists little evidence for such mechanistic synergy. Adults use co-occurrence statistics to encode speech–object pairings with detailed sensitivity in stochastic learning environ-ments (Vouloumanos, 2008). Here, we replicate this statistical work with nonspeech sounds and compare the results with the previous speech studies to examine whether exclusion constraints con-tribute equally to the statistical learning of speech–object and nonspeech–object associations. In environments in which performance could benefit from exclusion, we find a learning advantage for speech over nonspeech, revealing an interaction between statistical and exclusion processes in associative word learning	['SDG10']
10.1068/a4448	The spectacular and the mundane: Racialised state violence, Filipino migrant workers, and their families	We consider two case studies—a US soldier and a domestic worker—with the objective of elaborating spectacular and mundane instances of state violence as they emerge through projects of citizenship. Focused as they are on two very different mechanisms through which the state grants citizenship—military and immigration law—the two figures diversify and proliferate our understandings of the ambiguities of inclusion and exclusion through citizenship. We consider the family as both a regulatory ideal and as a site of the lived experience of racialised citizenship. And although the family is, as Foucault noted, one of the key ‘anchoring points’ for knowledge and power in modern societies, we want to consider what is excessive to the categories of citizen or worker within the intimacy of the family to suggest that this excess offers profound challenges to existing citizenship regimes. </jats:p	['SDG10']

An expected mitigating factor of the impact on social inclusion was social cohesion, which is the focus of the present study. A total of 1,352 Hong Kong Chinese adults were surveyed in 2009. The results show that social cohesion is perceived in Hong Kong to have mitigated the negative impact of the financial tsunami in terms of support for public policy relating to social inclusion of the older population.

As such, schools work to implement different intervention and prevention programs. Additionally, a variety of both criminal and civil legal interventions have recently been used to prevent or punish bullying. Most US states have enacted antibullying legislation that prohibits bullying behaviors, but definitional issues that are present in the empirical research are also present in such statutes. For instance, some states focus only on physical forms of bullying or leave definitions entirely up to individual communities and schools. Bullying victims also have the option to bring civil suits for tortious acts related to the bullying; this review provides examples of the difficulties with bringing such cases. </jats:p	['SDG10']

However, individuals differ in the degree of closeness they desire in their relationships. This study used the construct of inclusion of other in self (IOS) to analyze discrepancies between individuals’ actual and ideal levels of closeness in their relationships and the implications of these discrepancies for relational well-being and mental health. A longitudinal survey of partnered individuals demonstrated that optimal levels of relational well-being and mental health existed when individuals had minimal discrepancies between actual and ideal IOS, regardless of their actual levels of IOS. Individuals whose actual levels of IOS moved closer to their ideal levels over a 2-year period reported improved relational well-being and mental health. Individuals with little to no discrepancies between actual and ideal IOS were also less likely to break-up with their partners over time. </jats:p	['SDG10']

A survey directed toward homeless	PurposeThe Bibliothèque Publique d'information (Bpi), a large public reference library, located inside the Centre Pompidou in Paris, welcomes visitors from students to professionals and including the homeless community. In order to precisely diagnose the situation, the Bpi asked the French sociologist Serge Paugam to conduct a study of all these poorly housed or homeless users (refugees, migrants, people with mental health issues, etc.). This paper seeks to address these issues.Design/methodology/approachThe study was based on participant observations and in‐depth interviews throughout a six‐month period of time.FindingsPaugam looks upon social downgrading as a process and he distinguishes three steps he calls “Fragility”, “Dependency”, and “Rupture”. His hypothesis stated that the three stages of this process should be observed in the library. This was proved to be true. Moreover, the survey finding showed there are links between the stage of the process where people happen to be and their uses of the library.Originality/valueThis is the first French study directed toward homeless library users. It shows that although a public library welcomes everyone, social inequalities do not disappear. The survey finding confirms the diversity of the public, even among those users with poor living conditions, and the difficulty to offer services relevant to everybody, in a large public library such as the Bpi. Should the library offer the same set of activities to all those it serves? Or should it target specific groups of users and operate programs to meet their specific needs?</jats:sec	['SDG10']

The paper also connects with recent discussions on the complexity of relations between poverty and social exclusion in later life, as well as key themes emerging from studies of older people in disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods. Drawing on findings from a survey of 4000 households in rural Wales and interviews with older people in poverty in three rural places, the paper provides a detailed examination of the materialities and experiences of poverty among older people in rural places. In particular, it highlights how older poor groups construct their lives in complex terms with references made to both social inclusions and exclusions. The research also points to the significance of the socio-cultural contexts of place in shaping older people's understandings of poverty in rural areas	['SDG10']

Hungarian minority parties in competition	Parties of ethnic minorities are flourishing in a large number of ethnically divided democracies. While academic research has studied their emergence and success, we know little about intra-group party competition. This paper discusses the reasons for intra-group political plurality, with a focus on intra-party conflict and intra-group party competition: it explains the political orientation of ethnic minority parties and their intra-group challengers as a consequence of the inclusion of minority parties into government. The inclusion of minority parties into national governments produces an inherent conflict between pragmatic office-seekers and radical partisans. In minority parties that have governmental responsibilities, the pragmatist view overwhelms, while in those parties in opposition, radical voices dominate. The formation of two intra-Hungarian challenger parties in Romania and in Slovakia in 2007 and 2009 represents two very similar cases, which appear to be in line with our hypotheses.</jats:p	['SDG10']

The aims of this systematic literature review are to address the following questions: How can the instruments used within the research field “migration and HRQoL” be described or categorized? Which dimensions (psychological, physical and social) and associated sub-dimensions have been used concerning measuring HRQoL when measures are applied to migrants?                                           Design/methodology/approach                 – A systematic review was conducted. Three databases (Medline, Embase and Cinahl) were systematically searched for the investigation on HRQoL of migrants. Articles written in English, German and Polish, published since 2003 and meeting other inclusion criteria, were included in the final analysis.                                           Findings                 – In the first stage a total of 4,062 studies were identified. However, very few studies were found to focus on HRQoL among migrants. Finally, 28 studies were included in the analysis. The results confirm that the terms “migrant” and “Quality of Life” and “Health-Related Quality of Life” are neither congruently used nor defined, respectively, within these studies, which consequently impacts deleteriously on the application and measurement of the concept in these groups. The majority of the studies reported to measure HRQoL with a well-known and validated HRQoL instrument. The physical dimensions (symptoms/pain/vitality, energy/vitality/sleep and the objective/subjective health status) are predominantly represented in the reviewed literature. The psychological dimension mostly includes sub-dimensions such as psychological stress and depressive symptoms; the social dimension was predominantly considered as the sub-dimension social relationships/networking.                                           Originality/value                 – This paper highlights profound issues in the accurate assessment of HRQoL in migrants.

It is also difficult to access research findings and developments in this field. Under the ENABLE Network of ICT Supported Learning for Disabled People (2011–2014) project, an emerging European Union reference point portal for end-users will provide this information for a broad audience. In the design phase of the project idea, the authors of this paper conducted a review of papers indexed in Web of Science to provide a needs assessment and a design template for the project objectives. The results of the search clearly showed that ICT-supported learning for people with special educational needs is in the domain of the educational technology journals, with more papers published in the British Journal of Educational Technology than in any other journal. This paper presents the results of a content analysis of all papers published from 1970 to 2011 in seven educational technology journals indexed in Web of Science. More papers were published from 2006 to 2011 (44.7%) than during any other of five periods examined. Findings in terms of ICT intervention, disability groups, groups of study participants by relationship with ICT, and research design, together with trends in published studies in terms of mainstreaming and inclusion, are presented. The main objective of the study was to identify the level of inclusion through analysis of educational context (special schools [30.51%], mainstream schools [28.81%] and general support for life [40.68%]). Based on content analysis, ICT interventions were classified into the two categories of technical intervention in the pedagogical context (62.71% of all papers published) and technical intervention in the wider context (37.29% of all papers published), with nine paper types identified: papers on ICT access, papers on teaching and learning methods, papers on development and testing of ICT solutions, reviews, assessments, papers on inclusion, papers on behavioural and social development, papers on use of information technology and papers on interaction. Papers were also categorised according to types of disability and according to groups of study participants by relationship with ICT. Published papers were divided into four categories by research design: descriptive (49.15%), developmental (26.27%), experimental (17.8%), and developmental and experimental (6.78%). During the period from 1970 to 2000, papers examined design of learning materials with regard to particular categories of disability and particular accessibility needs, while papers published after 2000 also discussed universal design. Based on the review, the authors of this paper have identified a need for application of universal design principles in research and development of learning environments to provide equal accessibility and inclusive education.29 page(s	['SDG10']

In particular, knowledge about motivations for involvement can assist local governments in attempting to attract input from more than just the usual suspects, and to determine whose interests are represented. This article reports on an Australian study exploring seniors' motivations for participation in governance processes, using a two-phase mixed method approach. Findings from this study suggested that seniors' participation was motivated by both self- and other-directed, and both practical and abstract factors. Comparison of the sources highlighted nuances in the data which reflect questions about representation, representativeness and inclusion. Findings are discussed in relation to these questions, and implications for local government engagement practices are addressed	['SDG10']

10.14507/epaa.v22n43.2014	The middle schools role in the production of social inequalities	"This article explores the role of schools in the production and reproduction of social inequalities. It is based upon an empirical research conducted between 2005 and 2007 in twenty-four secondary schools located in the city of Buenos Aires, the surroundings of La Plata, the southern province of Neuquén and the northern province of Salta. It focuses on the findings from interviewing school principals. The analysis runs through four axis: how the inclusion of new social groups, particularly marginalized groups, is being perceived, and how it is changing the functions and operations of secondary schools; how the opposition between “them” (students and their families) and “us” (adults, school system) is played out; how the teaching of communication and expression and the language of rights appear as new formative contents; and how particular horizons for school actions are defined and envisaged. In these four dimensions, the article will seek to identify how social inequalities are being thought in the educational setting, and will inquire whether they are also being produced, and not only reproduced, by the school system.En este artículo proponemos revisar el papel de la escuela en la producción y reproducción de la desigualdad social. Basándonos sobre una investigación realizada entre 2005 y 2007 en veinticuatro escuelas medias de Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Gran La Plata, Provincia de Neuquén y Provincia de Salta, y centrándonos en entrevistas a directivos de las escuelas, tomaremos cuatro ejes de análisis: la percepción de los nuevos sectores sociales que se incorporan a la escuela secundaria y el cambio de funciones educativas; la oposición entre “ellos” (los alumnos y sus familias) y “nosotros” (los adultos, el sistema escolar); el surgimiento de la expresión y los derechos como nuevos contenidos formativos; y la definición de horizontes para la acción escolar. En esas cuatro dimensiones, buscaremos identificar cómo aparece la desigualdad social, y debatiremos si ella no es, a su vez, producida también desde la escuela media.Este artigo propõe uma revisão do papel da escola na produção e reprodução da desigualdade social.

However, as typically operationalized, symbolic racism as applied to candidate assessments fails to account for the emotions generated by a political campaign. Symbolic racism’s effects are moderated when emotional responses to Barack Obama are included in a candidate evaluation model, while emotions remain an important predictor. While symbolic racism and negative emotions lower evaluations, the presence of the positive emotions generated by the 2012 campaign counteracted both. Inclusion of both symbolic racism and emotion is necessary to understand perceptions of Obama as a black presidential candidate. </jats:p	['SDG10']

10.2304/rcie.2014.9.3.354	The impact of learning on women's labour market transitions	Women play an increasingly important role in the labour market and as wage earners. Moreover, in many countries, young women have outperformed men in terms of educational attainment and qualification. Still, women's human capital investment does not pay off as it does for men as they are still significantly disadvantaged on the labour market. Based on a qualitative empirical investigation with women in their mid-career, this article investigates the role of learning for women's labour market participation and career paths. Women's careers complexly intersect with role expectations, family needs, the career of the partner and anticipation of low returns of educational investment. This is typically reflected in discontinuous employment, part-time work and women's secondary wage earner position in the family. Furthermore, women qualified at the intermediate skills level are more likely to move horizontally in their career than vertically. Horizontal mobility thereby requires significant engagement with learning as the German labour market usually requires a formal qualification to realise a career change. Learning and further training thus become instrumental to facilitate and support women's career transitions, which are often aimed at re-entering regular employment after longer periods of family-related interruptions and/or to remain qualified in jobs in the social, health and educational fields, all of which are female dominated. Ultimately, women's significant engagement with continuing learning is not primarily expected to support career advancement and vertical mobility, particularly as it can neither alter discontinuities of employment nor the German-specific nexus between welfare, family and education policies and the labour market. This challenges the lifelong learning rhetoric insofar as one key aim of lifelong learning policies is to support labour market inclusion and the mobility of disadvantaged groups.</jats:p	['SDG10']

A specific segment of Nepal's constitutional trajectory is the 1990 constitutional experience. This book investigates the relationship between constitutional nationalism and patterns of legal exclusion during the 1990 constitutional experience of Nepal, focusing on the institutional management of socio-cultural diversity by the state in the context of post-Cold War re-democratization and the outcome of such strategy. The ‘unity in diversity’ approach embraced by Nepali state actors resulted in growing discontent among many social groups since 1990 and strong opposition to the 1990 Constitution itself. This book examines the legacy of this institutional strategy and how it is intertwined with the enduring socio-political conflict that Nepal has had to deal with even after the abrogation of the 1990 document in January 2007. It assesses the path-dependent importance of sedimented institutional structures and their resilience to change and considers the connection between law and politics in processes of constitutional change. It demonstrates that the recent reconfiguration of law primarily as ‘right’ places great expectations on the emancipatory potential of law in redressing historical injustices and initiating political change by legal means	['SDG10']

The focus is on the degree to which civil society organisations facilitate the representation of migrants within the public sphere. The policies considered are those introduced by New Labour and the current Coalition government. The theories adopted in this article are based on social cohesion and the public sphere, and the research is based on grey literature and interviews with civil society practitioners. The study concludes that, although the previous government gave visibility to migrants, the conditions imposed for their access to social provision have contributed to the demotion of cohesion. The Coalition's reforms have reinforced social divisions and given rise to two identities within civil society: the insiders, who are in dialogue with the authorities, and the outsiders, who have no contact with the decision makers.</jats:p	['SDG10']

10.1093/geronb/gbu075	Age at immigration and the incomes of older immigrants, 1994-2010	OBJECTIVES. Seniors comprise a growing proportion of new U.S. immigrants. We investigate whether late-age immigrants are disadvantaged in older age relative to those arriving earlier in life, based on income, reliance on public benefits, and access to public medical insurance. We test whether the 1996 welfare reform law altered the relationships between age at immigration and these outcomes. METHOD. Immigrants aged 65 and older in the 1994–2010 Current Population Surveys were classified by age at immigration. Median and logistic regressions are used to estimate the association between age at immigration and several outcomes and to test whether these associations differ for arrivals before and after welfare reform. RESULTS. Late-age immigration is strongly associated with lower personal income, lower rates of Medicare and Social Security receipt, and higher participation in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid. Arrival after 1996 is associated with lower rates of SSI, Medicaid, and Medicare receipt. The association between late-age immigration and income is stronger for post-1996 arrivals relative to earlier arrivals, whereas that between late-age immigration and Medicaid is weaker, suggesting that the penalty conferred by late-age immigration grew after reform. DISCUSSION. Late-age immigrants face formidable economic disadvantages exacerbated by exclusion from public benefits, with implications for immigration, health care, and welfare policy	['SDG10']
10.1177/0741713614564048	Educational Credentialing of an Aging Workforce: Uneasy Conclusions	This study investigates the educational attainment of an aging workforce from the perspective of educational credentialing. The research questions are defined as follows: Why are workers over age 50 attaining university degrees? How do they narratively construct the rational for pursuing well-recognized credentials in midlife? The specific focus is on Finnish professionals who pursued master’s degrees in their 50s. The basic motive for studying was to earn a recognized degree, which provides eligibility for professional jobs, validates past successes at work, and enables aging workers to maintain a good occupational position. At the same time, the interviewees questioned the power of educational credentials to define the status at work and in society at large. To prevent social exclusion of aging workers, it is necessary to question the normative faith on ever-increasing importance of educational credentials and address accompanying ageist practices. </jats:p	['SDG10']

On the other hand, a wide range of organizations and communities actively bring together members across societal cleavages. The dynamic of inclusion is exemplified among communities that expect a high degree of obedience to a set of beliefs and practices, but allow such authority to be limited and contested by different persons. Inclusion is also more likely among new or outsider organizations less associated with societal divides. To the extent that authoritative communities nurture diverse social networks, they contribute to bridging social capital and inclusive political attitudes. The essay draws on studies of various organizations and polities that articulate shared, moral goods (e.g., army, churches, martial arts schools, rural towns)	['SDG10']

10.1017/s0147547915000253	Making History through Policy: A Field Report on the International Domestic Workers Movement	AbstractPaid household labor has fertilized the development of national economies, while also nourishing the capitalist labor systems that has allowed globalization to thrive. However, this transnational sector has remained historically invisible, devalued, and unprotected from national and international legislative frameworks. In 2010, the International Labor Organization (ILO) finally embraced this challenge through two years of negotiations on the world's first international convention to assure “Decent Work for Domestic Workers.” These tripartite debates set the stage for the largest inclusion of “actual workers” in policy making. The debates also mobilized the world's first international domestic workers’ movement. This report from the field highlights a distinct process whereby workers themselves played a pivotal role in the creation of international labor policy. According to International Domestic Workers Federation president Myrtle Witbooi, this “new beginning” set “a benchmark for decent work and social equality.”</jats:p	['SDG10']
10.1177/0971333615594053	Social Exclusion, Mental Health, Disadvantage and Injustice	Social exclusion is a global multi-dimensional phenomenon that highlights the need for an extended inclusionary attitude in society. The present paper discusses some under-explored components of social exclusion. The major features of social exclusion as laid out in diverse approaches are described. The ways in which exclusion of the mentally ill and disabled, a relatively neglected group, differs from other forms of exclusion are examined. Attention is drawn to the relationship between social exclusion, disadvantage, deprivation and injustice. It is pointed out that poverty, disadvantage and deprivation may lead to social exclusion, but these factors alone do not constitute the dynamics of exclusion. The bilateral relationship between mental health/ill-health and exclusionary factors is discussed, taking into account elements such as stigmatisation, ‘othering’ or ‘otherness’. The injustice aspect of social exclusion is emphasised, and a case is made for redressal of distributive, procedural and interactional injustice with regard to the mentally ill as well as other excluded groups. A different approach is required in the case of the mentally ill and disabled as an excluded group, with greater action-orientation in policy-making. The discussion concludes with the view that remedying the problem of social exclusion in Indian society needs a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on ‘ the people as the core’. </jats:p	['SDG10']

Although some of these developments relate to periodic local elections, most are concerned with supporting new forms of engagement between local citizens and local government institutions and processes in the times between these. Starting with the coordination of its own consultation activities, then encouraging greater participation in council-run activities, and finally supporting grass roots engagement activities, Bristol City Council embarked on a local program of e-democracy activities from 2000 onwards. This grew into a national pilot scheme that enabled a number of valuable comparative evaluations of e-democracy in practice. The chapter draws on the results of a number of evaluations of these local and national developments and highlights the more widespread and enduring challenges of trying to broaden the scope and the effectiveness of local democracy and improve the practices of social inclusion.Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex	['SDG10']
10.4324/9780203120958	Talking tourists: The intimacies of inter-cultural dialogue	Culture and tourism were two of the major growth industries of the twentieth century, and in recent decades the combination of these two sectors into ‘cultural tourism’ has become one of the most desirable development options for countries and regions around the world. As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on The Impact of Culture on Tourism (2009) noted, cultural tourism accounted for almost 360 million international tourism trips in 2007, or 40 per cent of global tourism. In value terms, the contribution of cultural tourism is even greater, since cultural tourists are estimated to spend as much as onethird more on average than other tourists (Richards 2007). However, the rapid growth of cultural tourism from the preserve of the elite Grand Tourists to a major industry in the last century has also caused problems. Growing numbers of tourists at major sites and in small communities has raised questions about the sustainability of this new form of mass tourism. In particular it has become harder for destinations to profile their culture among the welter of products on offer, each desperate to claim their uniqueness. There is a growing number of places in search of new forms of articulation between culture and tourism which can help to strengthen rather than water down local culture, which can raise the value accruing to local communities and improve the links between local creativity and tourism. Many places are therefore turning to creative development strategies, or different forms of creative tourism in the process (Richards 2011). This chapter examines why and how cultural tourism is being transformed into creative tourism.</p	['SDG10']

The study was led by FIU and supported by USAID/OFDA and the UNISDR, with collaboration from researchers of INCAE Business School (Costa Rica), the University of Chile, Ohio University, and York University (Canada). Based on responses to nearly 1200 surveys, the key findings indicated that (1) 56% of respondents do not have a business continuity plan (BCP) in place; (2) 36.5% of businesses considered a BCP desirable, but stated that other priorities take precedence; (3) the lack of protection in the private sector is caused by not only financial constraints, but also the still not well-understood problems of avoidance, the competing priorities excuse, narrow decision making, and concerns about accountability; (4) small businesses show the least progress in establishing BCPs (14%) compared to larger businesses (44.9%); (5) there are insufficient incentives for DRR strategies to have practical impacts on business vulnerabilities and lack of resilience; (6) the implementation of regulations and enforcement mechanisms are weak to non-existent; and (7) little progress has been made in social responsibility and a sustained commitment to reducing the vulnerabilities of populations at risk. The current study offers recommendations to deepen the analysis, better understand the factors that intervene in the observed “risk indifference,” and identify possible interventions in order to move away from the status quo	['SDG10']

10.1080/13573322.2014.905464	Special educational needs in mainstream secondary school physical education: learning support assistants have their say	Learning support assistants (LSAs) gained more political and academic attention in Britain after Estelle Morris announced that schools of the future would include more trained staff to support learning to higher standards. LSAs, thus, should form an integral part of the culture of all school departments in Britain, including physical education (PE). The paper uses Antonio Gramsci’s concept of hegemony to explore the processes and practices that shape the views and experiences of LSAs and ultimately the extent to which they facilitate an inclusive culture in PE. A web survey gathered the views and experiences of LSAs vis-à-vis the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream secondary school PE in North-West England. A modified version of the tailored design method participant contact strategy resulted in 343 LSAs starting the web survey, with 154 (45%) following it through to completion. All quantitative data were analysed using Microsoft Excel whilst qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis. This entailed the identification of recurring themes and patterns present in the data. The findings highlight the hegemonic status of English, maths and science when it comes to the allocation of SEN resources, which most LSAs support and often reinforce. PE is particularly disadvantaged in this hierarchy of subject priority. The majority of LSAs have not received PE-specific training, which brings into question their ability to facilitate inclusion in PE. Moreover, many schools do not appear to value the involvement of LSAs in the planning of differentiated lessons, which could have a negative impact on the PE experiences of some pupils with SEN given that LSAs are perhaps most aware of the specific learning needs of the pupils they support	['SDG10']

However, currently, Mexico lacks of an accurate definition of such social group, and their characteristics as well as the magnitude and dimensions of the phenomenon are only partially and superficially known. The purpose of this research was to develop and validate a typology of homeless women living in Mexico City. To fulfill this purpose, 300 in-depth interviews were conducted and examined thoroughly with a systematic analysis of the content. The main results indicate that homeless women constitute a social group immersed predominantly in circumstances of violence, marginalization, poverty and social exclusion. Also, this collective includes two subgroups: women at risk of homelessness and women emergency sheltered, unsheltered or absolutely homeless and living in places not intended for human habitation. With this typology it is possible to define, characterize and distinguish homeless women. In addition, the phenomenon can be known with more certainty and accuracy enabling, thus, the design of effective treatment strategies.</jats:p	['SDG10']

Notified under Article XXIV GATT 1994, members of North-South RTAs must liberalize substantially all trade on a reciprocal basis, within a reasonable period of time, irrespective of their development status. Challenging the assumptions on which North-South regionalism rests, this article submits that Article XXIV has created a regulatory framework that sustains a monocultural conception of development which is synonymous with economic growth. Rejecting the economic model, this article argues that development should be understood as a multidimensional process, with an emphasis on equality of opportunities for all countries. Through a deconstruction of the textual interpretation of Article XXIV, and by analysing the practical application of this provision in the EU-ACP Economic Partnership Agreements, the gradual erosion of development from the process of trade liberalisation will be revealed. This article argues that the “rationalizing spell” of legal formalism must be broken in order to reimagine the legal framework, so that a concept of development, grounded in equality, is facilitated by the multilateral trading system.</jats:p	['SDG10']

10.1177/0042098015613003	A(nother) geography of fear: Burmese labour migrants in George Town, Malaysia	While scholarship around urban fear has brought forward important insights around the relationship between fear, mobility and social exclusion, questions relating to legal exclusion have largely been left outside the scope of inquiry. In cities around the world there are, however, a growing number of people who are not only de facto excluded from rights to/within the city (based on their gender, class, age etc.) – but de jure excluded based on their non-citizen or ‘illegal’ status in the host country. Drawing upon field work conducted in the Malaysian city George Town this study examines how both regular and irregular Burmese migrants perceive safety and danger in the city and how this, in turn, influences how they navigate urban space. The results of the study reveal how the migrants in George Town navigate the city as a ‘borderscape’ – producing a(nother) geography of fear which does not primarily reflect a fear of crime but rather a fear of state institutional practices, such as police controls, road blocks and raids. This shows, the paper argues, the need to pay attention towards both social and legal exclusions when examining how people in cities around the world are able to access and take possession of urban space. </jats:p	['SDG10']

10.1177/0967010616665957	Arctic (in)security and Indigenous peoples: Comparing Inuit in Canada and Sámi in Norway	While international relations has increasingly begun to recognize the political salience of Indigenous peoples, the related field of security studies has not significantly incorporated Indigenous peoples either theoretically or empirically. This article helps to address this gap by comparing two Arctic Indigenous peoples – Inuit in Canada and Sámi in Norway – as ‘securitizing actors’ within their respective states. It examines how organizations representing Inuit and Sámi each articulate the meaning of security in the circumpolar Arctic region. It finds that Inuit representatives have framed environmental and social challenges as security issues, identifying a conception of Arctic security that emphasizes environmental protection, preservation of cultural identity, and maintenance of Indigenous political autonomy. While there are some similarities between the two, Sámi generally do not employ securitizing language to discuss environmental and social issues, rarely characterizing them as existential issues threatening their survival or wellbeing.Drawing on securitization theory, this article proposes three factors to explain why Inuit have sought to construct serious challenges in the Arctic as security issues while Sámi have not: ecological differences between the Canadian and Norwegian Arctic regions, and resulting differences in experience of environmental change; the relative degree of social inclusion of Inuit and Sámi within their non-Indigenous majority societies; and geography, particularly the proximity of Norway to Russia, which results in a more robust conception of national security that restricts space for alternative, non-state security discourses. This article thus links recent developments in security studies and international relations with key trends in Indigenous politics, environmental change, and the geopolitics of the Arctic region.</jats:p	['SDG10']

This exploratory, mixed methods, cross-sectional study described and explored the social exclusion of Australian childless women aged 25 to 44 years, and asked: what are the nature and extent of social exclusion of childless women; and do the nature and extent of exclusion vary for different types of childless women? A total of 776 childless female Australian residents aged 25 to 44 years completed a self-administered questionnaire. Quantitative data were collected on childlessness types, indicators of exclusion and perceived stigmatisation and exclusion due to being childless. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, One Way ANOVAs and Kruskal Wallis Analysis of Ranks. Qualitative data on childless women&rsquo;s experiences were inductively thematically analysed. Findings suggest societal-level pronatalism drives exclusion of Australian childless women. While exclusion occurs in all domains of life, childless women experience more exclusion, and perceive more exclusion due to being childless, in the social and civic domains than the service and economic domains. Circumstantially and involuntarily childless women, followed by voluntarily childless women, perceive more exclusion due to being childless than undecided and future childed women. Experiences are influenced by the nature of women&rsquo;s &lsquo;deviance&rsquo; from pronatalism	['SDG10']

10.1080/18902138.2014.908634	Trans-national caring masculinity: Towards inclusive social counselling	This doctoral dissertation explores the way in which welfare state professionals and  authorities, NGO employees and social work students in Norway represent migrants –  Russian women and men from Africa and the Middle East – with regard to gender,  sexuality and ethnicity. The main objective of the thesis is to explore whether the  representations of migrants generate a tendency towards processes of inclusion or  exclusion and marginalisation with respect to Norwegian society. In terms of theory, it  draws on the cultural theory of representation (Hall 1997), the Foucaultian concept of  subject position (Foucault 1972, 1980) and the post-colonial, post-structuralist feminist  theory of intersectionality (Berg et al. 2010; Brah 2003; Lykke 2003, 2005; Staunæs and  Søndergaard 2006). I argue that professionals tend to represent migrants as ‘traditional’:  ‘migrant women in need of liberation’ and ‘foreign macho-men’. That positions persons  defined as ‘migrants’ as ‘others’, and lays the grounds for their symbolic and potentially  material exclusion from Norway’s ‘gender equal’ society. The analyses presents also the  way in which, professionals and migrants (more specifically, Russian women living in  northern Norway) transform these problematic gendered and sexualised representations  and define migrants as ‘transnational caring fathers’ and ‘career women, living in  harmonious families’. The research encourages us to revisit theories of inclusion within  liberal feminism, the philosophy of multiculturalism and mainstream policy making.  Concerns about the gender equality of migrants eclipse such political issues as distant  parenting, the push of migrant women to the care sector of the economy and restrictive  regulations of family reunification	['SDG10']

Research design: A within-subject, counterbalanced design was used. The two conditions, inclusion and ostracism, were examined across two groups (between subjects). Methods and procedures: A group of 21 adults with TBI and 17 matched controls participated in the Cyberball paradigm. This task is a computerised task that exposes participants to a game of catch and throw. In the inclusion condition they are included fairly in the game, while in the ostracism condition they are excluded from the game following the first few throws. Skin conductance levels (SCLs) were measured throughout the game as a proxy for social stress. Main outcomes: Results showed that people with TBI were cognitively aware of when they are being ostracised, but that their self-reported emotional experience to social exclusion was different to that of the control group. Differences in SCLs between groups and between conditions did not reach significance nor did they correlate with behavioural responses. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in terms of the consequences of dissociation between psychological and physiological responses and the implications for motivating behaviours associated with re-inclusion	['SDG10']

10.17645/si.v5i2.903	Promoting social inclusion through sport for refugee-background youth in Australia: Analysing different participation models	Sports participation can confer a range of physical and psychosocial benefits and, for refugee and migrant youth, may even act as a critical mediator for achieving positive settlement and engaging meaningfully in Australian society. This group has low participation rates however, with identified barriers including costs; discrimination and a lack of cultural sensitivity in sporting environments; lack of knowledge of mainstream sports services on the part of refugee-background settlers; inadequate access to transport; culturally determined gender norms; and family attitudes. Organisations in various sectors have devised programs and strategies for addressing these participation barriers. In many cases however, these responses appear to be ad hoc and under-theorised. This article reports findings from a qualitative exploratory study conducted in a range of settings to examine the benefits, challenges and shortcomings associated with different participation models. Interview participants were drawn from non-government organisations, local governments, schools, and sports clubs. Three distinct models of participation were identified, including short term programs for refugee-background children; ongoing programs for refugee-background children and youth; and integration into mainstream clubs. These models are discussed in terms of their relative challenges and benefits and their capacity to promote sustainable engagement and social inclusion for this population group	['SDG10']

Methods Data were used from two waves of the Dutch internet cohort LISS (Longitudinal Internet Studies of the Social Sciences; N = 511, M age = 52.09 years). Social inhibition was measured using the DS14 in 2012, sense of belonging (i.e., feeling cut off and having people to really talk to) was measured with the General Social Exclusion Index in 2012 and internalizing problems with the MHI-5 in 2015. Results Social inhibition was related to a lower sense of belonging and more internalizing problems. A low sense of belonging was related to more internalizing problems. Results indicated no moderation. However, evidence was found for partial mediation. That is, feeling cut off and having people to really talk to explained part of the link between social inhibition and internalizing problems. All analyses were controlled for sex, age and income. Limitations The items used to measure sense of belonging only cover part of the construct. The study was not fully prospective, as such, no conclusions can be drawn regarding causality. Conclusions Low sense of belonging is a key factor to consider when aiming at understanding individual differences in internalizing psychopathology related to social inhibitio	['SDG10']

10.1177/0011392116658089	Words don’t come easy: Al Jazeera’s migrant–refugee distinction and the European culture of (mis)trust	Al Jazeera’s August 2015 editorial decision to substitute ‘refugee’ for ‘economic migrant’ in its coverage of ‘the Mediterranean Migration Crisis’ provides an opportunity to re-frame the relationship between the politics of race, immigration and media representations of refugees. Situating the broadcaster’s publicly announced rationale for the decision within a critique of the migrant–refugee dichotomy enforced by European public policy, this article, first, demonstrates that the policy couplet mobilizes oppositional yet interdependent identities. The discursive distancing of ‘migrant’ from ‘refugee’ in news content does not dislodge their mutually reinforcing power to define the parameters of ‘inclusion’. Second, the article examines how the policy onus placed on refugees to justify their claim as ‘victims’ reproduces racialized codes of belonging that perpetuate the denial of autonomy. Persons seeking refuge in Europe must sustain an identity of ‘non-threatening victim’ if they are to gain recognition in a securitized culture of (mis)trust. Al Jazeera’s intervention strengthens the media representation of refugees as human beings without choice; yet, the broadcaster’s decision to ‘give voice’ by ‘challenging racism’ does not break the European political consensus on immigration and asylum that positions ‘non-Western’ peoples as victim/pariah, to be ‘saved’ and ‘suspected’. The media–policy–migration nexus ensures that refugee exclusion is always possible. </jats:p	['SDG10']

10.1163/15685314-04506004	We are the True Citizens of This Country	Democracy has generally been understood the best remedy to prevent societal violence, as it gives different groups a channel to voice their interests and grievances. However, in this article, that focuses on the Chittagong Hills, which for many decades has formed one of the most violent spaces in Bangladesh, we argue that, in reality, democracy and violence can be two sides of the same coin. This is not to say that in Bangladesh, where full liberal democracy is not in place, ordinary citizens have no values and idea(l)s of democracy and citizenship. On the contrary, in order to make sense of the intricate connection between democratic idea(l)s, and violent imaginations and practices, we focus in particular on the process of what we call the vernacularisation of democratic politics. We connect this process to the appropriation of citizenship and nationalism, by ordinary but radically differently-positioned people, in their daily realities.We demonstrate that widely shared imaginations of Bangladeshi-ness, as Bengali-ness or Muslim-ness, and of Bengalis/Muslims as the true nation and citizens of Bangladesh, are intimately connected with popular understandings and practices of democracy, which are based on the exclusion of the not-genuine-Bengalis, with the legitimisation and continuation of violence, and the exclusion of ethnic minorities in the Chittagong Hills	['SDG10']
10.1177/1078087416650044	Modes of Governance and Local Economic Development: An Integrated Framework for Comparative Analysis of the Globalizing Cities of India	This article explores how variations in provincial-state and city-level political cultures influence urban economic trajectory by mediating forces emerging out of global economic demand and a uniform national regulatory regime. The research shows how an integrated urban governance framework designed to analyze and compare governance modes of advanced capitalist cities through a fixed set of criteria (e.g., governing relations, governing logic, key decision makers, and political objectives) could be recalibrated through inclusion of additional parameters (e.g., local political culture and scalar location of power) so as to expand its applicability to an emerging economy, such as India, having a large, mostly poor, rural population and a high degree of internal sociocultural diversity. Competition between India’s regional elites to attract global information technology (IT)-enabled “business process outsourcing” economy investments, through land-use conversion of farmlands at the outer periphery of the metropolitan regions, forms the backdrop of the research. </jats:p	['SDG10']

10.1108/mrr-01-2017-0024	A study on the earnings response coefficient (ERC) of socially responsible firms: Legal environment and stages of corporate social responsibility	Purpose The purpose of the paper is to examine the corporate social responsibility (CSR) – earnings response coefficient (ERC) relation in the code-law tradition and the early stage of CSR practice to fill the research gap in the literature on CSR–ERC relation.   Design/methodology/approach The authors use an association framework for the study. They use the firms listed on Korea Stock Exchange because Korea is classified as a code-law country and most of firms in Korea are in the early stages of CSR development, and Korean samples are considered credible and stable because of the effective financial reforms initiated by Korean government in the late 1990s. The authors collected data from the two data sources: KisValue and Korea Corporate Governance Service.   Findings The authors find the following. First, CSR is negatively associated with ERC, which indicates that the ability of earnings to capture CSR implication is lower under the circumstances of the code-law and the early stage of CSR development. Second, political sensitivity (business group effect) is positively (negatively) associated with CSR–ERC relation, which means that the politically noticeable CSR concerns strengthen the CSR–ERC relation, and the inclusion of a firm in a business group weakens the CSR–ERC relation.   Research limitations/implications The paper derives theoretical implications on the quality of earnings reflecting CSR activities, provides practical implications to the investors who target international capital markets and is expected to help broaden the understanding of CSR–ERC relations in international capital markets.   Practical implications The paper provides practical implications to the investors who target international capital markets. Regarding the interpretation of accounting earnings that contain information on CSR activities, the legal origin and the CSR development stages are considered as key factors. Specifically, in the code-law and the early CSR environment, the potential benefits of CSR activities tend to be evaluated optimistically and reflected aggressively in reported earnings. Thus, if investors are in a similar international investment environment, they may need to recalibrate estimates in their decision model with additional CSR information from non-financial sources (e.g. sustainability reports).   Originality/value The paper is based on the international institutional theory and the discussion of CSR development stages. The international institutional theory states that the legal origin is one of the factors that can help explain the differential aggressiveness of reported earnings by country. In addition, the discussion of CSR stages argues that the CSR practices can be differentially implemented by CSR stages. The authors try to fill the gap in the existing literature by conducting an empirical study based on data from Korea Stock Exchange. </jats:sec	['SDG10']

In the first section our authors portray some major trends in the recent history of labour in Eastern Europe from a genuine semi-peripheral perspective. The articles of the second section discuss two salient issues of present-day East European politics: the mechanisms through which populism is shaping governance and the impacts of non-fulfilment of electoral pledges on representative democracies. The third section continues the debate about spatial exclusion and marginality that was the main topic of the previous issue of IEEJSP. The articles in this issue, however, focus on the political mechanisms beyond the Roma marginalisation in local communities: the invisibility of Roma political participation, the political economy impacts on ghettoization and the political strategy of moral panic in shaping Roma segregation	['SDG10']

Este trabajo se ubica en esta discusión y analiza cómo la generación de productos y servicios innovadores puede convertirse en una solución a problemas de exclusión social. La metodología combina el estudio de caso con el análisis estructural-causal. El caso estudiado es un proyecto de telemedicina en México. Mediante la identificación de actores y factores/hechos determinantes de este tipo de innovaciones se extraen y estilizan las relaciones estructurales-causales detrás de la generación de una innovación de productos inclusivos. La evidencia sugiere que las innovaciones inclusivas, en países en desarrollo, dependen del financiamiento público y requieren de la interacción sistémica de múltiples actores sociales, en los que el aprendizaje interactivo es una condición necesaria pero no suficiente para la generación y sostenibilidad de estas innovaciones. Se argumenta que una traba importante es la falta de incentivos económicos para las empresas, para que la política pública sea una herramienta que permita articular intereses público-privados. Asimismo, la falta de visión de los actores involucrados puede frenar los resultados inclusivos, desperdiciando recursos y capacidades generadas por proyectos piloto.</jats:p	['SDG10']

10.1017/s1755048318000706	Secular-Religious Competition and the Exclusion of Islam from the Public Sphere: Islamic Welfare in Western Europe	AbstractThis paper deals in a qualitative discourse analysis with the role of Islamic organizations in welfare delivery in Germany and the Netherlands. Referring to Jonathan Fox's “secular–religious competition perspective”, the paper argues that similar trends of exclusion of Islamic organizations from public social service delivery can be explained with discourses on Islam in these two countries. The analysis, first, shows that in the national competitions between religious and secular ideologies on the public role of religion, different views are dominant (i.e., the support for the Christian majority in Germany and equal treatment of all religions in the Netherlands) which can be traced back to the respective regimes of religious governance. However, and second, when it comes to Islam in particular, in the Netherlands, the perspective of restricting all religions from public sphere prevails which leads to the rather exclusivist view on Islamic welfare that dominates in Germany, too.</jats:p	['SDG10']

In order to open up the municipal safety management toolbox, this study explores which tools that are being used in Swedish municipalities and by which municipal sector. Our results indicate that tools such as risk inventory, safety rounds and risk analysis are broadly used across most sectors, while usage of other tools is more restricted to certain sectors. Legislative requirements, tool characteristics and actual needs are assumed to influence the usage of tools. Further research in this field is needed for better adaption of safety management tools to municipal needs.</p	['SDG11']
10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.02.019	A simple method for designation of urban ventilation corridors and its application to urban heat island analysis	"This paper describes urban wind ventilation mapping, using the concept of ""building frontal area index"", and uses the Kowloon peninsula of Hong Kong as an example of a dense, sub-tropical urban environment where ventilation is critical for human health. The frontal area index is calculated for uniform 100 m grid cells, based on three dimensional buildings in each cell, for eight different wind directions. The frontal area index is then correlated with a land use map, and the results indicate that high density commercial and industrial areas with large building footprints had higher values than other urban land use types. Using the map of frontal area index, the main ventilation pathways across the urban area are located using least cost path analysis in a raster GIS. Field measurements of urban winds confirmed the significance and functionality of these modelled ventilation paths. Comparison of the pathways with a map of the urban heat island suggests that ventilation is a key parameter in mitigating heat island formation in the study area. Planning and environmental authorities may use the derived frontal area index and ventilation maps as objective measures of environmental quality within a city, especially when temperatures in the inner city are a major concern.Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic"	['SDG11']

10.1080/00750778.2010.500525	An inventory of trees in dublin city centre	While urban areas are often considered to be comprised chiefly of artificial surfaces, they can contain a substantial portion of green space and a great diversity of natural habitats. These spaces include public parks, private gardens and street trees, all of which can provide valuable environmental services, such as improved air quality. Trees play a particular role in cities as they are often placed along roadsides and in the median strip of busy streets. As such they regulate access to sunshine, restrict airflow, provide shelter, scavenge air pollutants and manage noise at the street level. A tree planting policy can be an important part of a broader environmental strategy aimed at improving the quality of life in urban areas but this requires up-to-date knowledge of the current tree stock, which does not exist for Dublin. This article presents an inventory of trees in Dublin's city centre, defined as the area between the Grand and Royal canals. The results show that there are over 10,000 trees in the study area representing a density of 684 trees km2or one tree to approximately every 50 residents of the city centre. The tree canopy extent when in full foliage was nearly 1 km2in extent or 6% of the study area. A more detailed analysis of those trees planted along streets shows little species variation but clear distinction in the sizes of trees, which is indicative of the age of planting. These data are used to estimate the carbon stored in Dublin's trees	['SDG11']

10.3141/2148-01	Full bayes approach to before-and-after safety evaluation with matched comparisons	The full Bayes (FB) approach has recently been proposed for evaluating road safety treatments in before-and-after studies. In recognition of the advantages of the FB method and because of the lack of sufficient data to develop the safety performance function necessary to conduct an empirical Bayes study, the FB approach is used to determine the effectiveness of the Stop-Sign In-Fill (SSIF) program of the Canadian Insurance Corporation of British Columbia. The SSIF program funds the conversion from uncontrolled residential intersections to two-way stop-controlled intersections in an alternating pattern. This alternating pattern provides consistency in the application of stop signs within a residential neighborhood. Different modeling formulations for the before-and-after evaluation were investigated, and the results were compared with those of the traditional approach. No postprocessing of the results is required to achieve the odds ratio. The FB analysis revealed an overall significant reduction in predicted collision frequency of 51.1% with the credible interval (36.8%, 62.3%) at the 0.95 confidence level. It was also found that incorporating such design features as matched yoked comparison groups in collision prediction models may significantly improve the fit, while reducing the need to account for overdispersion. The results of the traditional technique were compatible with those of the FB approach at the overall level. It seems that the random selection of sites, which reduces the regression-to-the-mean effect, is the reason that both approaches gave relatively similar overall level results. However, the two methods produced quite different results at the zone (site) level. </jats:p	['SDG11']

However, limited evidence from intervention studies exists to support this approach. Drawing on classic epidemiological methods, psychological and ecological models of behavior change, and the principles of realistic evaluation, we have developed an applied ecological framework by which current theories about the behavioral effects of environmental change may be tested in heterogeneous and complex intervention settings. Our framework guides study design and analysis by specifying the most important data to be collected and relations to be tested to confirm or refute specific hypotheses and thereby refine the underlying theories. </jats:p	['SDG11']

10.1007/s12132-011-9109-x	Reinventing Planning: Critical Reflections	There is a growing acceptance in international development circles of the  contribution a revitalised planning can make to addressing key urban challenges. Current  expectations that planning can play roles in managing the growth of cities in ways that  promote their sustainability, inclusiveness and liveability, contrasts with past perceptions  of planning as an irrelevant discipline obsessed with spatial ordering and control. This  paper considers whether the new forms of planning can address the challenges facing  cities, with particular reference to the South African context. It does so through providing  an overview of the shift in thinking about planning, and reflecting on the new agendas for  planning as well as on some of their silences. It argues that the new approaches need to be understood in terms of contemporary urban and planning theories which are rethinking  the nature of planning and its relationship to power and institutions, and which view cities  as complex, dynamic places, embodying multiple interests and spatialities. These  perspectives can help to enrich our understanding of the new approaches to planning, and  to avoid ineffectiveness or a return to the negative elements of modernist planning of the  past. The paper demonstrates the argument through focusing on some of the recent  themes that have received attention in the contemporary international agendas for  planning: the cross-cutting themes of sustainability and gender; the infrastructural turn in  planning; and the ambiguities of the compact city. While these are quite particular  concerns, they highlight the complexities of institutionalising the new approaches to  planning, and ways of thinking about spatial planning	['SDG11']

Drawing on the “right to the city” discourses, adopting a Lefebvrian approach to the production of space, and a critical regionalist approach to housing and the built environment, the article explores the conceptual analytical neologism of contested urbanism, where the struggle for bottom-up, inclusive development processes push against political hand market pressures towards becoming a world-class city. Dharavi, at the heart of Mumbai, India, is at the frontline of oppositional practices confronting neoliberal, futuristic Dubai-style mega-projects focused on capital accumulation, elite consumption, slum clearance, and deregulated real-estate speculation. Building upon a three-week academic studio exercise in situ, the confrontational power dynamics that shape people's access to housing and redevelopment are depicted here as exemplar of a wider struggle over social justice, where Dharavi emerges as an eminent yet paradoxical example of a universal expression of contested spatial form in the Global South. </jats:p	['SDG11']

The overall evaluation of public transportation satisfaction in Beijing is 67.31, indicating that more great efforts should be paid to improve the public transportation satisfaction level in construction of the livable Beijing. The spatial structure of Livable City Public Transportation Satisfaction shows a “hot banding” distribution pattern, accompanying with 3 “cool spots”. To get a better understanding of the spatial pattern of the public transportation satisfaction, we used the Moran’s I and LISA to measure the spatial autocorrelation. The results illustrate that the public evaluation on the public transportation is spatial dependent and has tendency toward clustering. The cluster of areas with High-High association is located in the south of Beijing near Chang’an Avenue, highlighting and reshaping like a hollow circle, while the cluster of areas with Low-Low association is located in northwest Beijing and outside of the 4th ring road. Overall, the LCPTS in the north of Beijing lags obviously behind the overall level. The phenomenon is mainly due to the long-term accumulation of urban development.</jats:p	['SDG11']

10.1186/1471-2458-12-357	A successful model of road traffic injury surveillance in a developing country: Process and lessons learnt	Abstract Background Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) are one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide with 90% of global mortality concentrated in the low and middle income countries. RTI surveillance is recommended to define the burden, identify high risk groups, plan intervention and monitor their impact. Despite its stated importance in the literature, very few examples of sustained surveillance systems are reported from low income countries. This paper shares the experience of setting up an urban RTI surveillance program in the emergency departments of five major hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Method We describe the process of establishing a surveillance system including assembling a multi-institution research group, developing a data collection methodology, carrying out data collection and analysis and dissemination of information to the relevant stakeholders. In the absence of a road safety agency, the surveillance system required developing individual partnerships with industry, police, city government, media and many other stakeholders. Impact of the surveillance is demonstrated by some initiatives in the local trauma system and improvements in road design to effect hazard reduction. Conclusion We demonstrated that a functional RTI surveillance program can be established, and effectively managed in a developing country, despite lack of infrastructure and limitation of resources. Data utilization in the absence of well defined road safety infrastructure within the government is a challenge. More effective actions are hampered by the limited capacity in the transport and health sectors to do in-depth analysis through road safety audits and trauma registries.</p	['SDG11']

En concreto, las mayores dificultades surgen a la hora de analizar la información proveniente de los entornos urbanos, debido a la diversidad de elementos con distintas características que existen en áreas urbanas. Estos sistemas requieren, cada vez más, que la interpretación de la información se realice en tiempo real para mejorar la toma de decisiones. Por otra parte, la visión estéreo es ampliamente utilizada en sistemas de modelado, dada la gran cantidad de información que proporciona, pero al mismo tiempo, los algoritmos basados en esta técnica requieren de un elevado tiempo de cómputo que dificulta su implementación en aplicaciones de tiempo real. En este trabajo se presenta un algoritmo basado en visión estéreo para la detección tanto de obstáculos como de espacios transitables en entornos urbanos y que ha sido implementado principalmente en GPU (Unidad de Procesamiento Gráfico) para reducir el tiempo de cómputo y conseguir un funcionamiento en tiempo real.[EN] Both advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) applied to the improvement of road safety, and autonomous navigation vehicle systems require more and more complex sensors and algorithms capable of obtaining and interpreting the information of the road environment. The greatest difficulties arise in analysing the information of the urban environments, because of the large number of elements which have different characteristics in urban areas. These systems require to interpret the information in real time to improve the decision-making. On the other hand, the stereo vision is usable in modeling systems because of the great amount of information that it provides, but at the same time, the algorithms based on this technique have a high computation time which makes difficult its implementation in real time applications. This paper presents an algorithm based on stereo vision for detecting obstacles and free spaces in urban environments and it has been implemented principally in GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) to reduce the computation time and achieving that it works in real time.Este trabajo ha sido subvencionado por la CICYT a través del proyecto FEDORA (TRA2010- 20225-C03-01) y el proyecto Driver Distraction Detector System (TRA2011-29454-C03-02)Musleh, B.; De La Escalera, A.; Armingol, J.

10.1177/0096144212440886	A failure to deliver: Municipal poverty and the provision of public services in imperial São Paulo, Brazil 1822-1889	Municipalities in imperial Brazil were required by law to provide a substantial range of public services to their communities, yet the structure of the tax code allocated meager fiscal resources to finance the full complement of these services. Municipal financial ledgers for four municipalities in the province of São Paulo confirm that local governments operated with a perennial shortage of funds, which constrained the provision of public services and infrastructure. Municipal councils paid for the immediate needs of urban life out of their limited resources and used a form of official begging to procure funds from the provincial legislature to pay for major expenses. These requests were required by law but did not always result in the needed funding. The legal framework in which municipalities functioned during the Brazilian empire, therefore, was one of institutionalized subordination and financial penury that compromised their ability to provide government services to municipal residents. </jats:p	['SDG11']

10.1177/0042098012462610	Suburbanism as a Way of Life, Slight Return	Much attention has been given to increasing dominance of the post-war suburbs, and the concomitant rise of ‘suburbanism’ in ways of life in the ‘post-metropolis’. However, the meaning of suburbanism is rarely specified and there have been insufficient attempts to theorise its relationship to the urban. Drawing on the dialectical analyses of Henri Lefebvre, this article presents a theory of suburbanism as a subset of urbanism, with which it is in constant productive tension. Six distinct dimensions of the urbanism–suburbanism dialectic are identified, derived from extrapolating Lefebvre’s urban theory into second- and third-order analyses. These aspects of suburbanism are conceptualised not as static characteristics but as qualities that dynamically flow through, rather than define, particular places. Suburbanism is thus conceptualised separately from those places often termed suburbs, opening up the potential for interaction between these dimensions and the lived realities of everyday urban life and politics. </jats:p	['SDG11']
10.1590/s1984-46702013000200006	Changes in wild bee fauna of a grassland in Brazil reveal negative effects associated with growing urbanization during the last 40 years	Bee fauna and associated flora from a grassland site in Brazil, surveyed 40 and 20 years ago, were newly surveyed with comparable methodology to evaluate changes in the bee fauna of this site, considering that human population and urbanization has exponentially increased in the last 40 years. In general, bee species richness has declined in 22%, as well as their abundance. Some of the previously abundant species are now absent, including Bombus bellicosus Smith, 1879, Gaesischia fulgurans (Holmberg, 1903) and Thectochlora basiatra (Strand, 1910). No particular trend of differential decrease among either taxonomic or functional groups was observed, except for a minor increase in the proportion of oligolectic species and a 50% reduction in the number of large species. The first two surveys were more similar to each other in species richness per bee genus, while the two most recent grouped together based on measures of anthropogenic impact. Furthermore, the number of plant species visited by bees increased, with a pronounced increase in ruderal and exotic species. Crop cultivation, competition with honeybees and climate changes may all be related to bee decline. Nevertheless, the effects of urbanization, in particular intense land occupation and few preserved natural areas can be pointed as the main causes of species decline. Due to continuing increase in human population, increased erosion in diversity is expected. Habitat protection is an additional challenge to bee conservation in the region, with no local conservation units set aside for grasslands. State and municipal agencies should urgently consider the establishment of reserves for the few remaining patches of natural grasslands	['SDG11']

10.1177/0969776412459860	The eventification of place: Urban development and experience consumption in Berlin and New York City	Recent urban and economic development policies put much emphasis on the promotion of experiences. Within the experience economy, the production and consumption of products and places is transformed into “theater.” The organization of international festivals highlights that trend. However, festivalization has also infiltrated urban and economic development on a much smaller scale and turned into an overall eventification. In addition, producers and marketers of cultural products simultaneously apply this concept to advance their market positions. Hence, eventification provides shared interests for local stakeholders and producers and marketers of cultural products and opportunities to further include the latter in urban growth coalitions. This paper demonstrates how eventification fosters new relationships between local urban developers and individual artists in Berlin-Wedding and the South Bronx, New York City. It explores the benefits and disadvantages of experience planning through eventification including social exclusion and arts-led revitalization. Ultimately, eventification not only embraces an accelerating logic of ever more experience schemes and thus raises questions about its sustainability, but also features a process in which urban space, itself, is transformed into staged experiences of event consumption. </jats:p	['SDG11']

10.1016/j.ufug.2013.05.004	Variations of urban greenness across urban structural units in Beijing, China	Urban structural units (USUs) are work (or similar) units in urbanized areas. In this study, USUs based on urban land use and land cover were used to explain and compare urban ecological conditions within Beijing. This study focused on the spatial pattern of land use for different USUs in urban areas. The results showed that 453 USUs belong to 12 primary USUs and to 38 different secondary USUs. The percentage of built-up area was highest in those regions with hotels, and lowest in areas with cemeteries. The percentage of woodland area was highest in primary and middle schools, and the lowest in entertainment plazas. The percentage of grassland area was highest in farmland or orchards, and lowest in Siheyuan (courtyards). The percentage of green space is highest in lands dedicated to middle and primary schools, and lowest in areas with museums. There is no significant linear relationship between construction period and green space percentage in Colleges/Universities (R = 0.045, p=0.806 > 0.05) and Parks (R = 0.13, p = 0.43 > 0.05). However, there was an inverted-U curve relationship with the relevant housing price in the residential area, a relationship that can be described by the equation: f = 17736.45 + 348.21x - 4.15 x(2), p = 0.0022 < 0.05. This relationship implied that the socio-economic factors like housing prices may be a factor in determining the green space pattern of urban ecosystems in Beijing. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

This study is part of a larger study that investigated the working conditions and health of drivers and conductors of urban transportation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The sample size (1,607 participants) was calculated by means of quotas and was stratified according to occupation (drivers and conductors) in the bus companies of Belo Horizonte, Betim and Contagem. Face-to-face interviews were facilitated by means of a digital questionnaire, applied by the interviewer using a netbook. The outcome variable was constructed from combining the responses to the following two questions: (1) Over the last two weeks, have you felt tired when speaking? (no/sometimes/every day). (2) Over the last two weeks, have you noticed any worsening of your voice quality? (no/sometimes/every day). Sociodemographic, lifestyle, occupational characteristic and health situation data were gathered. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The prevalence found was 29% overall: 24% for drivers and 34% for conductors. Attention was drawn to positive associations with the function of conductor and with reports of exposure to vibration and thermal discomfort. Among the individual factors, only female gender reached statistical significance. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Risk factors exist that justify interventions to promote voice health within the urban transport sector under study. It would be appropriate to investigate whether vibration of the whole body would influence the functioning and morphology of the larynx.</jats:p	['SDG11']

Mastomys natalensis is a well-documented and major pest rodent species. In East Africa where it occurs outdoors, the species is characterized by marked population cycles. In contrast, it is mostly associated with humans in West Africa, and appears to live strictly indoors in the Sahel. Here, we have monitored the proportions of M. natalensis juveniles and sexually active adults within the city of Niamey, Niger. Our survey clearly shows that M. natalensis reproduces all year long, with no detectable seasonality. Altogether, our data confirm that reproduction may shift from seasonal to continuous when conditions are more favorable. They also suggest that the urban environment may represent an extreme habitat where resources are permanently available. From the perspective of rodent control in Niamey, our results highlight the need for a constant management policy that should be performed by public authorities	['SDG11']

Consisting of 671 housing units over 14 floors, the construction of Sahaspura was not just a housing project, but it was one outcome of an entire city development under the Sustainable Township Development Programme (STP). The mission of STP was to help Sri Lanka meet the shelter requirements of the urban poor by creating socially acceptable, economically viable and environmentally friendly housing and urban and spatial developments to ensure sustainable living in Colombo. The Sahaspura high-rise low-income housing project was the pilot project under the STP, and this paper discusses to what extent Sahaspura has achieved the STP mission to ensure sustainable living, 12 years after its construction.</p	['SDG11']

This paper investigates the experiences and lessons learnt in terms of effective stakeholder involvement gained from a case study on strategic sanitation planning in a peri-urban sub-district in the city of Darkhan, Mongolia. Conceptually the Darkhan case study builds on a participatory sanitation planning approach known in the literature as community-led urban environmental sanitation (CLUES) planning. Firstly, a brief introduction to the CLUES approach, its basic principles for effective stakeholder involvement and its adaptation to the Darkhan case study is given. Secondly, two relevant planning steps including the building and testing of pilot facilities are described and assessed in terms of effective stakeholder involvement. It is shown that even if not all basic principles could be fulfilled adequately, the participatory planning framework helped to improve the scientific outputs of the project – mainly the technological research and development – and to smooth the way for further actions towards the sustainable implementation of measures on a larger scale.</jats:p	['SDG11']

For the first time, the city was no longer drawn as a continuous bounded urban fabric, but as a set of linked and dispersed urban components distributed across the region. The competition drawings show the beginnings of a set of principles that architectural history usually attributes to modernism: a shared programme to plan the city as a linked but differentiated system of social, technical and biological functions.\ud This paper traces lines of continuity between the urban vision of Hermann Jansen, one of the two joint competition winners, and subsequent planning thought, in particular the ‘Zehlendorfer Plan’ of 1947. It argues that Jansen can be understood as having initiated the concept of the strategic urban plan—his ‘skeleton’ of urban growth—that can adapt and change according to need, and in negotiation with a range of disciplines and stakeholders. Jansen saw the residential quarter as a distinct component of this growth, which could be resolved at a different moment in time, by a different set of expertise. The ‘Zehlendorfer Plan’ exemplified this flexible adaptable form of planning in which the drawing serves as an instrument of negotiation	['SDG11']

These are analyzed in relation to the gap between ES science and ES policy and structured according to the different types of planning uncertainties they represent. One issue that was persistently highlighted by stakeholders was that the promotion of urban ES - regardless of how beneficial it may be - will add further complexity to already strained workloads among planners, policy-makers and urban managers. Also, the political demand for increasing density in the urban areas of Stockholm seems to create a growing need for urban ES. Urban densification can thus potentially promote the interest in planning with ES as a vital parameter for urban qualities. They expressed a need for long term perspectives in planning with new tools and methods for valuing ES, supported through ""high profile"" projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

10.1525/rac.2015.25.1.110	Liberal protestants and urban renewal	AbstractThis article examines the liberal Protestant encounter with the urban renewal programs that remade U.S. cities after World War II. Suburbanization had punishing consequences for cities and threatened the already tenuous presence of liberal Protestants there. The concept of renewal—in both its religious and secular dimensions—promised a solution to these problems. Many renewalists, those clergy and laypeople who viewed deteriorating urban neighborhoods as an opportunity to restore Church unity, initially embraced urban renewal as a secular corollary to their work. But the interaction among ecclesial organizations, government, and inner city parishioners over its implementation exacerbated tensions within liberal Protestantism. Many who initially supported urban renewal came to conclude that its results did not match their own objectives. By supporting challenges to redevelopment from African Americans, Latinos, and other urban residents, renewalists criticized the Church for what they believed to be complicity in the degradation of Christian culture and the urban environment.This history demonstrates the mutual influence of culture and organizational structure within liberal Protestantism and the impact of those changes on secular society. Renewalists grappling with urban renewal programs interpreted both theological and secular concepts through their own experiences with city populations, Church bodies, government, and redevelopment agencies. Their subsequent actions prompted mainline denominational leaders to support, for a time, at least, ministries geared more towards to indigenous community development. Such ministries reflected a more pluralist conception of society and the Church's role in it. Eventually, renewalists' opponents turned this pluralist conception on its head, decentralizing the church bureaucracies that had funded their ministries. An analogous process took place in the urban renewal programs themselves, underscoring the ways in which religious and urban histories intersect.</jats:p	['SDG11']
10.1177/0308518x15597131	Floating or settling down: the effect of rural landholdings on the settlement intention of rural migrants in urban China	The industrialization and urban development in China have driven a huge portion of the rural population to its urban areas. While discriminating institutions engendered by the hukou system exclude most rural migrants from urban rights and benefits, the option of converting hukou has become increasingly available. Nevertheless, few rural migrants have chosen to settle down in cities by obtaining an urban hukou, which contradicts a common perception that rural migrants desire an urban hukou. Based on a recent migrant survey in Jiangsu Province, this paper explores rural migrants' intention of hukou conversion with respect to the availability, type, and quantity of rural landholdings in their home countryside, as well as their socioeconomic attributes and migration patterns. The results of regression analyses indicate that both the possession of farmland and housing land in rural areas significantly influences the intention of rural migrants to obtain an urban hukou in their destination cities. Moreover, systematic variances in settlement intention are found between the “born-after-1980” generation and their older counterparts, as well as between migrants from the more and less affluent regions. These findings suggest that the decision of hukou conversion incorporates varied concerns and purposes among rural migrants in Chinese cities, which should be addressed with more responsive rural and urban policies. </jats:p	['SDG11']
10.1016/j.trpro.2014.11.011	Transport and Land Use Interaction: A French Case of Suburban Development in the Lille Metropolitan Area (LMA)	AbstractTransit Oriented Development as sustainable mobility strategy is not part of French policy, in practice or in academic literature, even though a certain number of projects follow some of its principles. Reciprocally, from abroad, French experiences are not recognized as TOD, even when they could be. Scientific literature is needed in this direction. This is the focus of this paper.This paper identifies two realizations that can be qualified as TOD implementations according to criteria that we have defined previously in a Franco-German research program (Bahn.Ville). For each of these two cases, while their transport network is examined, we also study their insertion into the urban environment at a local level. The interaction between land use and transport system is the focal point of this study through a reading of planning documents, geospatial data specific processing and analysis, and on-site investigations. Parallel analysis is undertaken on the processes of realization. In both cases, we look into cooperation between public and private actors from multiple sectors and on different scales. Combining actual planning strategies, we examine policies of metropolitan level that support similar realizations in the future, not only in the field of transport, but also on housing and economic activities. Therefore, we present existing and future instruments for the implementation of TOD in the Lille Metropolitan Area. New planning tools, such as “DIVAT” and “Contrat d’axe”, are designed in the intent of defining intersectoral policies of transport and urbanism. These tools are currently being introduced and put into practice in Lille Metropolis	['SDG11']

10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.052	Modeling the hepatitis A epidemiological transition in Thailand	AbstractBackgroundIn most low- and middle-income countries, hepatitis A virus (HAV) is shifting or expected to shift from high endemicity to intermediate or low endemicity. A decreased risk of HAV infection will cause an increase in the average age at infection and will therefore increase the proportion of infections that results in severe disease. Mathematical models can provide insights into the factors contributing to this epidemiological transition.MethodsAn MSLIR compartmental dynamic transmission model stratified by age and setting (rural and urban) was developed and calibrated with demographic, environmental, and epidemiological data from Thailand. HAV transmission was modeled as a function of urbanization and access to clean drinking water. The model was used to project various epidemiological measures.ResultsThe age at midpoint of population immunity remains considerably younger in rural areas than in urban areas. The mean age of symptomatic hepatitis A infection in Thailand has shifted from childhood toward early adulthood in rural areas and is transitioning from early adulthood toward middle adulthood in urban areas. The model showed a significant decrease in incidence rates of total and symptomatic infections in rural and urban settings in Thailand over the past several decades as water access has increased, although the overall incidence rate of symptomatic HAV is projected to slightly increase in the coming decades.ConclusionsModeling the relationship between water, urbanization, and HAV endemicity is a novel approach in the estimation of HAV epidemiological trends and future projections. This approach provides insights about the shifting HAV epidemiology and could be used to evaluate the public health impact of vaccination and other interventions in a diversity of settings	['SDG11']

10.1016/j.cities.2016.03.001	How do metro stations integrate with walking environments? Results from walking access within three types of built environment in Beijing	China is in a period of rapid metro system development. However, there are few empirical evaluations of the complex interactions between the local built environment and metro ridership in the Chinese context. In this study, we collected empirical data on the influence of local environmental characteristics on walking access in Beijing. Walking behaviors and built environment perceptions among commuters (N = 495) were collected at six metro stations in three distinctly different physical settings in Beijing two in hutong, two in danwei, and two in xiaoqu. Participants recorded walking routes from the metro stations until they arrived at their destinations. Evaluations of the built environment were collected using a questionnaire after the participants arrived. Geographic information system was used to map walking routes and code built environment variables. Walking behavior outcomes were measured as walked time from metro exit to participant&apos;s destination. ANOVA compared differences between perceived and measured built environment characteristics and walking behaviors among selected neighborhoods. Multiple regression was used to test for associations between the built environment and metro station routes. We found that mean walking time from the metro station to a destination was 8 min. Recreational and office destinations had similar walking times to the metro station as residential destinations. Metro riders in xiaoqu and danwei walked longer distances to their destinations compared to metro riders in hutong. Physical obstacles to crossing streets made walking times longer. Greater connectivity, both perceived and measured, predicted shorter walking times. Local land use is not well integrated into metro station placement in Beijing. Better connectivity, pedestrian-friendly designs and higher building coverage ratio around the metro station might promote easier walking access and have the potential to capture more metro riders.

10.1007/s00607-016-0505-x	Predicting critical conditions in bicycle sharing systems	Bicycle sharing systems are eco-friendly transportation systems that have found wide application in Smart urban environments. Monitoring and analyzing the occupancy levels of the system's stations is crucial for guaranteeing the quality of the offered service. Advanced data mining solutions tailored to bicycle sharing data analysis are needed to support system managers to react to critical situations (e.g., lack of parked bicycles at a station) that can yield service disruption. This paper presents STation Occupancy Predictor (STOP), a data mining framework to predicting the occupancy levels (i.e., critical or non-critical) of the stations in the near future through Bayesian and associative classifiers. The prediction is made based on the current and past station occupancy values and on the temporal information associated with the predicted time instant. A classification model per station is generated on the collected data to support domain experts in understanding the underlying events. The model allows predicting short-term station occupancy levels and characterizing system usage to support planning maintenance activities in the medium term as well. As a case study, STOP has been thoroughly evaluated on real data acquired from the bicycle sharing system of New York City. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the STOP system	['SDG11']

10.1007/s11367-016-1174-x	Environmental performance of rainwater harvesting strategies in Mediterranean buildings	"Purpose: The rapid urbanization and the constant expansion of urban areas during the last decades have locally led to increasing water shortage. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems have the potential to be an important contributor to urban water self-sufficiency. The goal of this study was to select an environmentally optimal RWH strategy in newly constructed residential buildings linked to rainwater demand for laundry under Mediterranean climatic conditions, without accounting for water from the mains.  				 Methods: Different strategies were environmentally assessed for the design and use of RWH infrastructures in residential apartment blocks in Mediterranean climates. The harvested rainwater was used for laundry in all strategies. These strategies accounted for (i) tank location (i.e., tank distributed over the roof and underground tank), (ii) building height considering the number of stories (i.e., 6, 9, 12, and 15), and (iii) distribution strategy (i.e., shared laundry, supply to the nearest apartments, and distribution throughout the building). The RWH systems consisted of the catchment, storage, and distribution stages, and the structural and hydraulic calculations were based on Mediterranean conditions. The quantification of the environmental performance of each strategy (e.g., CO2eq. emissions) was performed in accordance with the life cycle assessment methodology.  				 Results and discussion: According to the environmental assessment, the tank location and distribution strategy chosen were the most important variables in the optimization of RWH systems. Roof tank strategies present fewer impacts than their underground tank equivalents because they enhance energy and material savings, and their reinforcement requirements can be accounted for within the safety factors of the building structure without the tank. Among roof tanks and depending on the height, a distribution strategy that concentrates demand in a laundry room was the preferable option, resulting in reductions from 25 to 54 % in most of the selected impact categories compared to distribution throughout the building.  				 Conclusions: These results may set new urban planning standards for the design and construction of buildings from the perspective of sustainable water management. In this sense, a behavioral change regarding demand should be promoted in compact, dense urban settlements.Peer Reviewe"	['SDG11']

The results show that the TransMilenio BRT offers equal access for all socio-economic strata (SES). Nonetheless, its modal share is low for the poor due to affordability issues. The Cicloruta bicycle network and Ciclovía recreational program do not offer equal access for all SES, especially for the lower SES. Their users, however, mainly come from low and middle income SES.

10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.079	Impacts of compact growth and electric vehicles on future air quality and urban exposures may be mixed	‘Smart’ growth and electric vehicles are potential solutions to the negative impacts of worldwide urbanization on air pollution and health. However, the effects of planning strategies on distinct types of pollutants, and on human exposures, remain understudied. The goal of this work was to investigate the potential impacts of alternative urban designs for the area around Tampa, Florida USA, on emissions, ambient concentrations, and exposures to oxides of nitrogen (NOx), 1,3-butadiene, and benzene. We studied three potential future scenarios: sprawling growth, compact growth, and 100% vehicle fleet electrification with compact growth. We projected emissions in the seven-county region to 2050 based on One Bay regional visioning plan data. We estimated pollutant concentrations in the county that contains Tampa using the CALPUFF dispersion model. We applied residential population projections to forecast acute (highest hour) and chronic (annual average) exposure. The compact scenario was projected to result in lower regional emissions of all pollutants than sprawl, with differences of − 18%, − 3%, and − 14% for NOx, butadiene, and benzene, respectively. Within Hillsborough County, the compact form also had lower emissions, concentrations, and exposures than sprawl for NOx (− 16%/− 5% for acute/chronic exposures, respectively), but higher exposures for butadiene (+ 41%/+30%) and benzene (+ 21%/+9%). The addition of complete vehicle fleet electrification to the compact scenario mitigated these in-county increases for the latter pollutants, lowering predicted exposures to butadiene (− 25%/− 39%) and benzene (− 5%/− 19%), but also resulted in higher exposures to NOx (+ 81%/+30%) due to increased demand on power plants. These results suggest that compact forms may have mixed impacts on exposures and health. ‘Smart’ urban designs should consider multiple pollutants and the diverse mix of pollutant sources. Cleaner power generation will also likely be needed to support aggressive adoption of electric vehicles	['SDG11']
10.1111/grow.12166	Urban Concentration and Poverty in Developing Countries	We investigate the impacts of urban concentration (share of the population living in large cities) on poverty in developing countries. We use instrumental variables to estimate a system linking urban concentration, growth and urban and rural poverty. The results show that the importance of the population living in (small) cities (less than 0.5 million inhabitants) or very large cities (beyond 5 million inhabitants) has no impact on poverty. The importance of cities of 1 to 5 million inhabitants is poverty reducing. We conclude that developing countries with a large share of the population living in very big cities could reduce poverty by deconcentrating their urbanization toward cities of between 1 and 5 million inhabitants.SCOPUS: ar.jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe	['SDG11']

El grup d'enquestats representa a agents que tenen un paper en la transformació dels espais urbans, capaços de donar una opinió sobre el disseny urbà.Els resultats de l'enquesta es presenten en comparació porcentual. En aquests, el 100% dels arquitectes, el 85,7% dels planificadors urbans i el 94% dels estudiants d'aquitectura reconeixeren que l'edifici fou dissenyat utilitzant el mètode BDMUD, degut a la diferenciació dels altres edificis de l'eix del carrer. En altres paraules, d'acord amb el 91,1% dels participants, el mètode BDMUD va implicar una diferenciació entre aquest edifici i els altres en termes de forma, proporció, materials i disseny d'aquest. Per altra banda, entermes d'ús del sòl d'aquest lloc, per part de l'edifici, el 62,75% dels participants prefereix un ús mixt amb ús comercial a la planta baixa i l'ús residencial en els pisos superiors, mentre que el 37,25% dels participants prefereix l'ús comercial exclusiu. Es necessita més investigació per crear nous liniaments per codis de contrucció, basats en el mètode BDMUD per carrers importants, avingudes i accessos a la ciutat.           This study examines a building located on the Adana-Ankara road axis in Kayseri, and its relationship with its immediate surroundings in terms of urban design, during its design and construction process, as well as post-construction. The study consists of two main sections. The first looks at the use of the Building Design Management in Urban Design (BDMUD) method in relation to this building. BDMUD is a proposed new method for integrating urban design, urban planning and architectural design, by adding collaboration planning to Virtual Reality (VR) and Building Information Model (BIM). The second section is a post-construction survey to evaluate the success of the BDMUD method in terms of the building’s size, geometric shape (hereafter form), proportion, material, building layout and building use–land use conducted with a target group comprising city planners and architects based in Kayseri and architecture students (especially senior students) from the Erciyes University Department of Architecture. The survey group represents stakeholders with a role in the transformation of urban spaces who are able to give an opinion on urban design. The outcomes of the survey are presented in percentage comparison. In the survey, 100% of the architects, 85.7% of the city planners and 94% of the architecture students recognized that the building was designed using the BDMUD method due to its differentiation from the other buildings on the road axis. In other words, according to 91.1% of the participants, the BDMUD method resulted in differentiation between this building and the others in terms of form, proportion, material and building layout. On the other hand, in terms of building use-land use at this site, 62.75% of the participants preferred mixed use with commercial use on the ground floor and residential use on the upper floors, while 37.25% of participants favored commercial use only. Further research is needed to create new building code guidelines based on the BDMUD method for important streets, boulevards and city entrances.</jats:p	['SDG11']

La cobertura espacial fue calculada mediante la creación de 1) zonas buffer circulares utilizando distancias Euclidianas y 2) zonas irregulares usando el algoritmo de Dijkstra a través de las vías de la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resultados.&lt;/strong&gt; La cobertura espacial del programa fue 78,4% usando las zonas buffer circulares y 60,2% utilizando el algoritmo de Dijsktra. El análisis de accesibilidad espacial, reveló que la zona norte de la ciudad y algunas zonas de la periferia presentan la menor accesibilidad al programa. Esta área periférica es una zona crítica por tratarse de una interface entre las zonas rural y urbana, lo que representa un riesgo para la re-introducción de rabia en la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusiones.&lt;/strong&gt; El modelo de accesibilidad espacial 2SFCA es una herramienta eficaz para identificar áreas aisladas, evaluar de forma más precisa el uso y proporcionar bases para la localización estratégica de servicios de salud. Los resultados del análisis enfatizan la necesidad de vigilancia e intervención en las áreas con bajo acceso al servicio.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p	['SDG11']

However, with the passage of time, usually a city's old settlements undergo numerous socio-economic and physical transformations leading to an urban chaos. The walled city of Alwar in the state of Rajasthan is selected as a representative case study of a medium-sized historic city with a rich cultural past. Alwar is one of the regional priority towns in National Capital Region Plan-2021 of Government of India and is proposed to be an important magnetic centre for the region. The walled city area and its old neighbourhoods portray unique features of a Historic Urban Landscape (HUL). The study identifies the core urban elements of its HUL and Arc Map-10.1 is used to spatially map characteristics of its old neighbourhoods, commercial areas, road network, open spaces and intangible heritage. Figure Ground Analysis and Development Trends Analysis are carried out based on primary surveys, reveal changing housing needs and economic requirements. The study concludes that the traditional residential culture of mohallas and chowks and their rich heritage should be included in the development plans of government with a focus on community-based regeneration rather than tourism alone. This may ensure a socio-economic and environmental sustainability in the long run for such historic settlements	['SDG11']
10.3846/16486897.2016.1185431	Climate-oriented assessment of main street design and development in Budapest	Main streets play pivotal role in urban areas in terms of economic, social, moreover environmental contexts. Such streets are generally situated in densely built-up areas, where the adverse effects of climate change, such as rising temperature and changing precipitation patterns occur emphatically. Increasing urban heat island effect or extreme amount of runoff water during severe storms and floods significantly decrease the adaptive capacity of a city, consequently its residents becoming more vulnerable. Therefore involving climate-oriented design principles into planning and construction phase contributes to reach more sustainable and climate-friendly open spaces what are strongly relevant especially in main streets which are designed for a great amount of people. Present study provides a criteria matrix for assessing the climate-friendly level of recently renewed main streets in Budapest. Due to this assessment tool the adaptation and mitigation performance of the selected projects can be evaluated. For identifying strengths and weaknesses of a given project, a rating scheme has been applied by selecting and using 42 indicators grouped into mitigation, adaptation and awareness raising categories. Thus planners, decision-makers and other stakeholders can easily define future opportunities and challenges, accordingly this study may contribute to take urban street design practices toward climate-friendliness by paying more attention on changing local weather patterns and related consequences	['SDG11']

10.1108/ijccsm-04-2015-0046	A supply chain framework for characterizing indirect vulnerability	Purpose Climate vulnerability assessments are often operationalized by the analysis of indicators defined by the spatial boundaries of the community under study. These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens.   Design/methodology/approach The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila.   Findings The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective.   Originality/value Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability. </jats:sec	['SDG11']

Energy security and sustainable development have gained attention in the current global environment. Many businesses and consumers are becoming aware and concerned about damage to the environment. Huge amount of energy can be saved by using energy efficient equipment. Lighting accounts for about 30 percent of total residential electricity use. LED bulbs are being used as an energy-efficient lamp with an objective of conserving energy. The paper examines the adoption of energy efficient lighting technologies in Mumbai households. A survey was administered to examine how the environmental concern, environmental responsible behaviour and perceived value of LED Bulbs products impact its adoption by the consumers. The study validates that factors such as perceived value, environmental concern and environmentally responsible behaviour are instrumental in stimulating the adoption of LED bulbs among users. </jats:p	['SDG11']

10.1016/j.chb.2017.06.019	From road distraction to safe driving: Evaluating the effects of boredom and gamification on driving behaviour, physiological arousal, and subjective experience	Highlights - Our driving simulator study addresses safety risks posed by boredom and low task engagement. - A gamified intervention is studied as a means to increase engagement in the safe driving task. - The intervention reduced speeding while promoting anticipatory driving. - We infer that gamification may increase and sustain attention and arousal throughout a drive. Abstract Boredom and low levels of task engagement while driving can pose road safety risks, e.g., inattention during low traffic, routine trips, or semi-automated driving. Digital technology interventions that increase task engagement, e.g., through performance feedback, increased challenge, and incentives (often referred to as ‘gamification’), could therefore offer safety benefits. To explore the impact of such interventions, we conducted experiments in a high-fidelity driving simulator with thirty-two participants. In two counterbalanced conditions (control and intervention), we compared driving behaviour, physiological arousal, and subjective experience. Results indicate that the gamified boredom intervention reduced unsafe coping mechanisms such as speeding while promoting anticipatory driving. We can further infer that the intervention not only increased one’s attention and arousal during the intermittent gamification challenges, but that these intermittent stimuli may also help sustain one’s attention and arousal in between challenges and throughout a drive. At the same time, the gamified condition led to slower hazard reactions and short off-road glances. Our contributions deepen our understanding of driver boredom and pave the way for engaging interventions for safety critical tasks	['SDG11']

10.1515/noise-2015-0005	Towards the integration of urban sound planning in urban development processes: The study of four test sites within the SONORUS project	Noise pollution in urban environments is today a major problem affecting inhabitants of many European cities. Reducing noise is therefore a necessity. As a result, many cities now have noise action plans comprising concrete actions to tackle noise issues in affected areas. Nevertheless, these often isolated documents only address existing problems. In order to change this practice an integrated strategy is necessary. A new approach to urban sound planning, a holistic approach, is being developed and tested within the SONORUS project and it is described in this paper. SONORUS, the Urban Sound Planner project, is an initial training network (ITN) that is educating researchers in a whole range of acoustic disciplines, as well as in advanced urban planning processes. An essential part of this training is the application of the holistic approach to real test sites. Although this is an ongoing work, a few innovative techniques were already developed and its application to the test sites resulted in improved urban sound planning tools. This paper promotes the discussion about the implications that the holistic approach might have in urban sound planning policies and how it can be a driving force for changing the noise pollution situation in urban environment	['SDG11']

10.1177/0042098017725475	Mixed-use development in Christchurch, New Zealand: Do you want to live there?	Christchurch, one of New Zealand’s major cities, has been dealing with a housing shortage after a series of major earthquakes struck in 2010 and 2011, causing extensive damage to the city. Consequently, two distinct types of housing development appeared in the suburban areas of Christchurch: low-density single-use neighbourhoods and higher-density mixed-use neighbourhoods. The latter type is relatively new for Christchurch suburban areas where low population densities dominated prior to 2011. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the preferences of the residents of Christchurch and its surrounding districts for living in mixed-use neighbourhoods. Specifically, it sought to identify the weights that those residents place on the costs of house purchase and transport, versus neighbourhood costs associated with mixed-use development, when purchasing a residential property in the suburban areas of Christchurch. For this, a stated preference survey was developed, using the efficient design method, and mixed-logit models were estimated using the data. The results show that most of those residents prefer to live in low-density single-use neighbourhoods rather than in higher-density mixed-use neighbourhoods, and are sensitive to increases in the land price, density of development and diversity of land use in the areas. </jats:p	['SDG11']

The research focuses on the renewal of the large prefabricated housing estates, dominant type of urban housing in the area where after the privatisation process resident-owners own only a so-called floating plot under their block. In total, 80 per cent of the land of the whole neighbourhood remains public. The question is how participatory place-making works in this specific urban, social and cultural situation?   Design/methodology/approach By introducing the topic from a theoretical point of view, the study is based on research conducted in Budapest’s Újpalota Housing Estate. Fieldwork, project analysis and interviews uncover the complexity of this Hungarian case where appropriation of residents, municipality and European social regeneration projects are simultaneously present with different types of participatory methods.   Findings The majority of real changes in Újpalota – as well as in housing estates of post-Communist countries in general – are led by individual or common appropriation that sometimes becomes convincing participation. This informal transformation of the built or natural environment can create a small sense of place everywhere. At the same time, it can work against the architectural and urban character of a neighbourhood or a building, rendering a feeling of disorder.   Originality/value The paper based on this Hungarian case shows that the real culture of participatory place-making is still missing in post-Communist context, and despite some good examples, the majority of people are inactive, waiting for changes to be made by leaders. </jats:sec	['SDG11']

Being placed at the crossroads of important trans-European corridors, this territory in Southern Pannonia has always been exposed to various influences and shifts of power, which have left a significant mark on their urban matrix. The most prominent period was certainly Habsburgs' rule in Southern Pannonia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which radically reshaped inherited organic medieval-oriental matrix into planned, orthogonal regulation. This, Habsburg legacy has influenced the urban development of these towns until today. The aim of this chapter is to present the outcome of Habsburg urban regulation and accompanied orthogonal imprint in four towns, selected as case studies. The previous periods, as well as the recent challenges, are also considered. In the conclusion, the uniqueness and identity of these towns is discussed, regarding the morphing and transformations of their urban patterns during the selected periods.</jats:p	['SDG11']

Green space may play an important role for promoting neighborhood social capital and health for older adults; however, safety remains a significant challenge in maximizing the benefits of green space. Data were drawn from 647 independent-living seniors who participated in the Senior Neighborhood Quality of Life Study in the Seattle/King County and Baltimore/Washington DC region. The results suggest that certain green space elements, such as natural sights, may be beneficial to neighborhood social capital of older adults. However, other types of green space, such as parks and street trees, may be less advantageous to older adults who perceive their neighborhoods as unsafe for pedestrians. Findings highlight the importance of pedestrian safety in examining associations of green space with neighborhood social capital in older adults. Further studies using a longitudinal design are warranted to confirm the causality of the findings	['SDG11']
10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-2297-2018	Application of classification algorithm of machine learning and buffer analysis in torism regional planning	Abstract. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geography Information System (GIS) technologies are widely used in ecological analysis and regional planning. With the advantages of large scale monitoring, combination of point and area, multiple time-phases and repeated observation, they are suitable for monitoring and analysis of environmental information in a large range. In this study, support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm is used to monitor the land use and land cover change (LUCC), and then to perform the ecological evaluation for Chaohu lake tourism area quantitatively. The automatic classification and the quantitative spatial-temporal analysis for the Chaohu Lake basin are realized by the analysis of multi-temporal and multispectral satellite images, DEM data and slope information data. Furthermore, the ecological buffer zone analysis is also studied to set up the buffer width for each catchment area surrounding Chaohu Lake. The results of LUCC monitoring from 1992 to 2015 has shown obvious affections by human activities. Since the construction of the Chaohu Lake basin is in the crucial stage of the rapid development of urbanization, the application of RS and GIS technique can effectively provide scientific basis for land use planning, ecological management, environmental protection and tourism resources development in the Chaohu Lake Basin.                     </jats:p	['SDG11']

Mapping distribution, quality and quantity of wetland vegetation is important for wetland protection, management and restoration. This study evaluated the performance of object-based and pixel-based Random Forest (RF) algorithms for mapping wetland vegetation using a new Chinese high spatial resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite image, L-band PALSAR and C-band Radarsat-2 data. This research utilized the wavelet-principal component analysis (PCA) image fusion technique to integrate multispectral GF-1 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Comparison of six classification scenarios indicates that the use of additional multi-source datasets achieved higher classification accuracy. The specific conclusions of this study include the followings:(1) the classification of GF-1, Radarsat-2 and PALSAR images found statistically significant difference between pixel-based and object-based methods; (2) object-based and pixel-based RF classifications both achieved greater 80% overall accuracy for both GF-1 and GF-1 fused with SAR images; (3) object-based classifications improved overall accuracy between 3%-10% in all scenarios when compared to pixel-based classifications; (4) object-based classifications produced by the integration of GF-1, Radarsat-2 and PALSAR images outperformed any of the lone datasets, and achieved 89.64% overall accuracy.

These models require both detailed data and advanced statistical methods. Many factors influence land-use change decisions, such as parcel characteristics, accessibility to activities, and current and historical neighborhood conditions. Therefore, spatial and temporal components must be incorporated in a model at the highest possible disaggregation level in order to achieve robust results. A spatio-temporal multinomial autologistic model, incorporating space and time and their interactions, is introduced to investigate land-use dynamics at the parcel-level, and is applied to Delaware County, Ohio. It is able to capture the impacts of the existing and historical neighborhood conditions of parcels with high accuracy. Advanced computational methods are used to deal with the computational challenges of parameter estimation. The model is validated, estimating 91.4% of all observations correctly for the period 2005–2010, and is applied to land-use forecasting. </jats:p	['SDG11']
10.1177/0361198118782275	Water Transit and Ferry-Oriented Development in Sweden: Comparisons with System Trends in Australia	Water transit is increasingly becoming an option for cities looking to expand their public transport network and provide an alternative to land-based transport congestion. But there are challenges in realising a functional urban ferry network, especially in Sweden which faces land use policy and weather-related constraints. This paper has three related aims: i) to compare the development of water transit in Swedish and Australian cities, ii) to compare changes in patronage over time, and iii) to analyze the role of ferry-oriented development (FOD) and planning policy effects on water transit development. Our approach is exploratory and comparative, and we use the cases of Stockholm and Gothenburg in Sweden with comparison to Brisbane and Sydney in Australia. Patronage figures indicate that in both countries, water transit systems are a small part of the total public transport network, from 0.5% of total public transport trips in Stockholm to 3.7% in Brisbane. However, there has been modest growth in patronage that in relative terms has exceeded that of urban rail and bus services in all cities except Sydney. Integration of water transit with land use plans in FOD varies, with Brisbane and Sydney embarking on large-scale waterfront and transit plans focused on economic development. In Sweden integration with land use remains in early stages, with ad hoc terminal location and restrictive land use being limiting factors, especially in Stockholm. There are also conflicting strategies toward FOD in Gothenburg. Better conceptualization of land use implications for development of water transit planning is therefore suggested.No Full Tex	['SDG11']

Interventions designed to address a diverse range of urban challenges bring innovative social and technical components together to learn by doing. Seen through this lens, the modernist planning that dominated the urban arena for much of the twentieth century seems to have given way to what we might term the experimental city - a condition where the urban both forms an arena for experimentation and is shaped by it (Evans et al. 2016). The appeal of urban experiments lies in their ability to be radical in ambition while limited in scope; ground-breaking rather than rule-breaking. Experimentation permits learning, which is increasingly identified as a necessary ingredient to ‘scale up’ solutions both within and between cities	['SDG11']

10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.07.034	Contemporary sea level rise rates around Malaysia: Altimeter data optimization for assessing coastal impact	The increase of anthropogenic activities has triggered global sea level rise to threaten many low-lying and unprotected coastal areas. Without measures, global sea levels will continue to rise at an accelerating rate in the 21st century. This paper quantifies sea level trends around the Malaysian seas using measurements from multiple altimeter missions over 1993–2015. Sea level anomalies (SLAs) are determined using data from the Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS) covering 8 altimeter missions. We use an enhanced processing strategy to optimize sea surface heights from RADS for the derivation of SLAs, including filtering, data gridding and moving average. Tidal height measurements at eight tide gauge stations around Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia are used to assess SLAs from altimetry. Our assessment results in similar patterns of SLAs, high correlation coefficients (>0.9) and small (few cm) root mean square differences (RMSE) between SLAs from altimetry and tide gauges over the same period. Sea level trends are determined by the robust fit regression analysis for the SLA time series. Our result shows that sea level rise trends around Malaysia range from 3.27 ± 0.12 mm yr−1 off eastern Malaysia to 4.95 ± 0.15 mm yr−1 west of Malaysia. Over 1993–2015, the mean rising rate around Malaysia is 4.22 ± 0.12 mm yr−1, and the cumulative sea level rise is 0.05 m. This paper predicts the impact of such rising sea levels on environment, urban planning and climatology in the coastal areas of Malaysia	['SDG11']

10.15201/hungeobull.67.3.4	The impact of territorial policies on the distribution of the creative economy: Tracking spatial patterns of innovation in slovenia	The creative economy as an alternative pathway for industrial decline was first introduced into practice in metropolitan regions of the Global North. Since then, it has gradually spread out to other highly urbanized areas of the Global South and transitional areas such as post-socialist European countries. Numerous studies tried to explain structural conditions and suggested policies to attract, retain and release creative potentials. However, the focus on promotion of the creative economy is still on large cities and sectoral policies by emphasizing economic, social and legislative issues of the creative labour. There is little evidence about how territorial policies shape the development of the creative economy, especially in medium-sized and small towns outside the reach of the agglomeration areas. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of territorial policies on the distribution of the creative economy in Slovenia as an example of the post-socialist country. By analysing spatial-temporal trends of patents, we track patterns of innovation between 1975 and 2014 in the urban system. A central focus is given to examine changes in urban hierarchy, i.e. relationships between Ljubljana as the capital and the only large city in the country, regional centres and small towns. The spatial-temporal analysis of patents granted in Slovenia confirmed the linkages between territorial innovation systems and policies. The main findings show that innovation has become more evenly distributed across space, which can be attributed to long tradition of polycentric spatial development in times of Yugoslavia and more recent territorial policies favouring further dispersion of the local self-government system in Slovenia	['SDG11']
10.3390/w10101450	Environmental factors and the microbial quality of urban drinkingwater in a low-income country: The case of Madagascar	International audienceAccess to piped water is often limited to urban areas in low-income countries, and the microbiological quality of drinking water varies due to technical and environmental constraints. To analyse the parameters that modulate the contamination of these systems, this study examines 16 years of microbial quality data for water supplied in 32 urban areas of Madagascar. A discriminant statistical approach and agglomerative hierarchical clusters were applied to environmental and climatic data. The microbial contamination varied between sites from 3.3 to 17.5%, and 78% of the supply systems showed large variations between years or months. Agglomerative hierarchical clusters (AHCs) revealed four supply system profiles that share a similar bacteriological evolution. Heavy rainfall and dry periods sustained increasing contamination, as reflected in levels of spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia (SSRC) and/or total coliforms (TC). SSRC were dominant in three profiles, with faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) dominant in the other. Principal component analysis demonstrated the main drivers of contamination: type of water source, implemented treatment, location of the site, population growth, lack of protection, agriculture, urbanization/sanitation, and flooding threats. Contamination increased over the 16-year period, reaching alarming levels. The protection of water sources should be a concern for public authorities	['SDG11']

10.3390/su10124701	Land spatial development based on carrying capacity, land development potential, and efficiency of urban agglomerations in China	The Chinese government is undergoing a major reform. The current core task of new Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is to establish a national territorial spatial planning system (NTSPS). Urban agglomeration has become a main body in NTSPS. China’s new urbanization strategy identified 19 key development areas of urban agglomerations (UA), but the land development path is not clear. Due to the lack of research on the land development intensity evaluation (LDIE) of urban agglomerations, this study applied a GIS-based, multi-criteria method for LDIE to the Shandong Peninsular urban agglomeration (SPUA). Evaluation indices were determined for three factors (development intensity, supporting capacity, and utilization efficiency) that comprise the discriminant model of the three-dimensional matrix method, which was used to establish the method for this topic and demonstrate the accuracy of the land spatial development intensity. This empirical study on the SPUA indicated that, overall, the average indices for development intensity, supporting capacity, and utilization efficiency in the study area are 0.40, 0.34, and 0.55, respectively. Using the three-dimensional matrix discrimination model, three zones of development intensity were identified: key, stable, and restricted development zones. The threshold values for construction land growth in the eight cities of the SPUA were obtained. The findings provide a theoretical reference and guide for the practical application of LDIE as well as a scientific basis for sustainable land development and utilization.</jats:p	['SDG11']

The Social Vulnerability Index was determined by using fluviometric station data provided by ANA and socioeconomic variables from IBGE. The results indicate a moderate to low vulnerability that does not reflect the socio-spatial environment of the area, where the alert level of 6 m is recurrently exceeded during the floods of the Xingu river. The Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant will ensure the maintenance of the level of floods, which implies in the demand of urban planning that can reduce the liabilities generated by both the maintenance of wetlands, and for the extensive relocation of people, in addition by studies that assess the influence and consequence of extreme events in the region.</jats:p	['SDG11']

10.1145/3277668	Decentralized collective learning for self-managed sharing economies	The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for             decentralized collective learning             . This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the             Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections             , accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.           </jats:p	['SDG11']
10.3390/land7020075	Assessment of land cover change in peri-urban high Andean environments south of Bogotá, Colombia	Bogot&aacute;, the rapidly growing center of an emerging economy in the northern part of South America, is located within a biodiversity hotspot in the tropical Andes. The surrounding mountains harbor the ecosystems P&aacute;ramo and Bosque Altoandino whose high water retention capacity serves as a &ldquo;natural water tower&rdquo; for the city&rsquo;s freshwater supply. Since Bogot&aacute; is steadily growing, the city spreads into its peri-urban area, thus threatening its proximal ecosystems. In this study, the land use and land cover change (LULCC) of Bogot&aacute;&rsquo;s surrounding area is analyzed with random forest algorithms for the period 1989 to 2016. The basin of the Rio Tunjuelo, a subbasin of the Rio Bogot&aacute;, was selected for analysis, as it is typical for the entire area in terms of relief, land use and land cover. A multiple logistic regression analysis is applied to identify different determining factors of the changes. LULCC analysis of the Rio Tunjuelo basin shows an ongoing but abating southward spread of Bogot&aacute;&rsquo;s outer rim, an increase of agricultural land, and decrease of natural vegetation. After an initial heavily spatial spread of urbanization in the early 1990s, the speed of urban spread declined in the past years. Statistical analysis implies that the defined natural vegetation classes must be considered as one spatial entity. The probability for their change increases with decreasing distance to established agricultural areas, which indicates human impact as a relevant factor for LULCC. Generally, the explained deviance (D2) is low and hence it is presumed that the LULCC determining factors are not predominantly found among environmental parameters	['SDG11']

Understanding green product innovation as a result of interaction between innovation and sustainability has become a strategic priority for theory and practice. This article investigates green product innovation by means of a multiple case study analysis of 12 small to medium size manufacturing companies based in Italy and Canada. First, we propose a conceptual framework that presents three key environmental dimensions of green product innovation such as energy minimization, materials reduction, and pollution prevention as identified in the life cycle phases of products. Based on insights gained from in-depth interviews, we discuss firms' motivations to develop green products, environmental policies and targets for products, different dimensions of green product innovation, and challenges faced during developing and marketing of green products. Results from the study are then synthesized and integrated in a toolbox that sheds light on various aspects of green product innovation and provides solutions to challenges and risks that are faced by firms. Finally, implications for managers, academia and public policy makers are discussed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V	['SDG12']

10.1016/j.geothermics.2010.09.005	40 years of Dogger aquifer management in Ile-de-France, Paris Basin, France	International audienceGeothermal energy has been supplying heat to district networks in the Paris Basin for more than 40 years. The most serious difficulties have been corrosion and scaling related problems that occurred in many geothermal loops in the mid-1980s. The main target of all exploration and exploitation projects has been the Dogger aquifer. Most of the operating facilities use the “doublet” technology which consists of a closed loop with one production well and one injection well. Injection of the cooled brines leads to the progressive exhaustion of the resource at the local doublet scale. Consequently, most of the research effort has been focused on quantifying the temporal evolution of the cooling, and to forecast the lifetimes of doublets and the occurrence of the “thermal breakthrough”. At the turn of the 21st century, there was a revival of geothermal energy development in France and new projects are presently being considered. The 40 years of experience in geothermal exploitation of the Paris basin constitutes a firm basis upon which to devise a sustainable regional management approach for the geothermal resource. Several governmental policies seek to promote further geothermal development of the Dogger aquifer with structures in place to facilitate technical studies	['SDG12']

These approaches are helpful in measuring and assessing the intensity (efficiency) of products' use and their impact on the environment. However, they do not sufficiently reflect the dynamics and improvements in the achieved outcomes as compared to the population (generation) growth. Moreover, they do not allow always analysing product changes on the world level. Referring to this existing gap, we conceptualise a new approach — product generational dematerialisation (PGD) indicator, measuring product efficiency and population changes in relative values, and use it for investigating the dematerialisation for the world energy sector in the last 35 years. The indicator can be used as a new methodical tool to support and evaluate sustainable management policies on the enterprise, regional, national, and international level as well as for different resources, goods, and services. </jats:p	['SDG12']

10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01592.x	Extinction vulnerability of coral reef fishes	With rapidly increasing rates of contemporary extinction, predicting extinction vulnerability and identifying how multiple stressors drive non-random species loss have become key challenges in ecology. These assessments are crucial for avoiding the loss of key functional groups that sustain ecosystem processes and services. We developed a novel predictive framework of species extinction vulnerability and applied it to coral reef fishes. Although relatively few coral reef fishes are at risk of global extinction from climate disturbances, a negative convex relationship between fish species locally vulnerable to climate change vs. fisheries exploitation indicates that the entire community is vulnerable on the many reefs where both stressors co-occur. Fishes involved in maintaining key ecosystem functions are more at risk from fishing than climate disturbances. This finding is encouraging as local and regional commitment to fisheries management action can maintain reef ecosystem functions pending progress towards the more complex global problem of stabilizing the climate	['SDG12']

And all of the hotel buildings are high quality hotels with 3-star or above. Due to the extremely local climate, the energy demand on heating and cooling is dominant in the total energy consumption. From the analysis, it is found that heating in winter accounts for more than half of the fuel use and cooling in summer is for around half of power consumption. Moreover, the chillers, pumps and terminals are responsible for one third of HVAC energy consumption respectively. As estimated from the samples, the energy consumption index of Chongqing hotel buildings is between 107 and 155 kWh/m2.</jats:p	['SDG12']

10.1371/journal.pone.0026446	Physiological responses in a variable environment: Relationships between metabolism, hsp and thermotolerance in an intertidal-subtidal species	Physiological responses to temperature reflect the evolutionary adaptations of organisms to their thermal environment and the capability of animals to tolerate thermal stress. Contrary to conventional metabolism theory, increasing environmental temperatures have been shown to reduce metabolic rate in rocky–eulittoral-fringe species inhabiting highly variable environments, possibly as a strategy for energy conservation. To study the physiological adaptations of an intertidal-subtidal species to the extreme and unpredictable heat stress of the intertidal zone, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression were quantified in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Using simulate natural temperatures, the relationship between temperature, physiological performance (oxygen consumption and heat shock proteins) and thermotolerance were assessed. Depression of oxygen consumption rate and upregulation of heat shock protein genes (hsps) occurred in sequence when ambient temperature was increased from 24 to 30°C. Large-scale mortality of the sea cucumber occurred when temperatures rose beyond 30°C, suggesting that the upregulation of heat shock proteins and mortality are closely related to the depression of aerobic metabolism, a phenomenon that is in line with the concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT). The physiologically-related thermotolerance of this sea cucumber should be an adaptation to its local environment	['SDG12']

The degree of substitution (DS) of xylan acetates ranged between 0.9 and 2.0 as a function of experimental conditions. Due to the problems of toxicity and recycling of DMF, an alternative method of esterification is reported in the second part of this work, performing in the absence of organic solvent and using DMAP or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) as catalysts. Acetylation reaction catalyzed by MSA was developed through an experimental design in order to achieve the highest DS under the mildest conditions. The significant factors and their interactions were identified. The optimization of reaction parameters allowed to obtain a high DS (1.6) and maximal yield (85%). Moreover, the reactivity of propionic and hexanoic anhydrides was evaluated and hydrophobic xylan esters with low degrees of substitution were obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our recent work demonstrated a promising tradeoff between data rate performance and energy conservation. However, more greening still implies possibly lower data rate, and allocating this ""price of greening"" across interfering users needs to be fair. This paper proposes four for- mulations of fair greening in interference-limited networks, unifies them into one general representation, and develops a unified algorithm to solve them effectively. Simulations quantify the intuitions on fairness in greening DSL, as these four alternative approaches offer a range of choices between maintaining a high sum data rate and enforcing various definitions of fairness. Fairness of allocating the price of greening is also interesting in its own right.</jats:p"	['SDG12']

However, it critiques Weaver's operationalization of sustainability, his assumption that sustainable mass tourism (SMT) will be the 'emergent norm' due to external factors, and his destination development theory showing different paths that, however, all end in SMT.

10.1021/es303264c	Dissolution of brominated epoxy resins by dimethyl sulfoxide to separate waste printed circuit boards	Improved methods are required for the recycling of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs). In this study, WPCBs (1-1.5 cm(2)) were separated into their components using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 60 degrees C for 45 min and a metallographic microscope was used to verify their delamination. An increased incubation time of 210 min yielded a complete separation of WPCBs into their components, and copper foils and glass fibers were obtained. The separation time decreased with increasing temperature. When the WPCB size was increased to 2-3 cm(2), the temperature required for complete separation increased to 90 degrees C. When the temperature was increased to 135 degrees C, liquid photo solder resists could be removed from the copper foil surfaces. The DMSO was regenerated by rotary decompression evaporation, and residues were obtained. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to verify that these residues were brominated epoxy resins. From FT-IR analysis after the dissolution of brominated epoxy resins in DMSO it was deduced that hydrogen bonding may play an important role in the dissolution mechanism. This novel technology offers a method for separating valuable materials and preventing environmental pollution from WPCBs.Engineering, EnvironmentalEnvironmental SciencesSCI(E)EI3ARTICLE62654-26604	['SDG12']

10.1617/s11527-012-9952-9	Flexural behavior of reinforced recycled aggregate concrete beams under short-term loading	Recycling of waste concrete is one of the sustainable solutions for the growing waste disposal crisis and depletion of natural aggregate sources. As a result, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is produced, and so far it has mostly been used in low-value applications such as for the pavement base. But, from the standpoint of promoting resource and energy savings and environmental preservation, it is essential to study whether a concrete made of recycled aggregates-recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) can be effectively used as a structural material. The experimental research presented in this paper is performed in order to investigate the flexural behavior of RAC beams when compared to the behavior of natural aggregate concrete (NAC) beams under short-term loading and consequently the possibility of using RAC in structural concrete elements. Three different percentages of coarse RCA in total mass of coarse aggregate in concrete mixtures (0 %-NAC, 50 %-RAC50, and 100 %-RAC100), and three different reinforcement ratios (0.28, 1.46, and 2.54 %) were the governing parameters in this investigation. Full-scale tests were performed on nine simply supported beams until the failure load had been reached. Comparison of load-deflection behavior, crack patterns, service deflections, failure modes and ultimate flexural capacity of NAC and RAC beams was made based on our own and other researchers' test results. The results of conducted analysis showed that the flexural behavior of RAC beams is satisfactory comparing to the behavior of NAC beams, for both the service and ultimate loading. It is concluded that, within the limits of this research, the use of RAC in reinforced concrete beams is technically feasible	['SDG12']

The so called “direct moulding” is a compression moulding process which is directly applied to rubber particles from tyre grinding. After one year of activities, the new moulding process has been deeply investigated and some results are reported in the current work for the first time. Rubber granules and powders were produced by GumiImpex (partner of the European project) thanks to different technologies: particles from tyre grinding and buffings from tyre machining. Different size distributions of rubber particles and buffings were used to produce rubber sheets with the size of 200x200x5 mm3 at the temperature of 160°C and the pressure of 3 MPa by using aluminium moulds. Tensile specimens were extracted from the sheets and tensile tests were performed and related to sample density and particle properties. Rubber densities over 1 g/cm3 have been reached for all the samples with ultimate tensile strength and maximum elongation up to 1 MPa and 80%, respectively. These mechanical data are very promising in comparison with properties of polyurethane bound rubber composites. Increasing moulding pressure and temperature would lead to higher mechanical properties, if necessary	['SDG12']

10.1002/pen.23594	Optimizations of polyester degradation process of waste copper wire for the application of Cu recycling	Recycling of waste copper wire (WCW) has attracted much attention as waste has a huge negative impact on the natural environment. In this study, easy, low cost, and highly efficient technique for recycling copper materials from polymer-coated copper wire was developed using induction heating furnace. Polyester layer on the surface of WCW has been analyzed using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and Dynamic Thermogravimetric Analysis. As a result, it was confirmed that the polymer coated on the Cu wire, was found to be indeed polyester. A voltage ranging from 562 to 969 V was applied to polymer-coated WCW using induction furnace to remove the coated polymer layer completely from the surface of WCW. FTIR and NMR (Nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy analyses were performed to investigate degradation mechanism of polyester. After applying 969 V, FTIR spectra showed no significant peak for polyester indicating complete removal. Based on this FTIR and NMR analyses, authors assume that, unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, and ethylene are remained with Ash on the Cu wires as final products. Therefore, Cu recycling was successfully done by removing polyester completely at applied voltage of 969 V. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 54:607-615, 2014.

We use a case study of trophy hunting of an endangered antelope, the mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), to explore how uncertainties generated by population monitoring and poaching interact with decision making by 2 key stakeholders: the safari companies and the government. We built a management strategy evaluation model that encompasses the population dynamics of mountain nyala, a monitoring model, and a company decision making model. We investigated scenarios of investment into antipoaching and monitoring by governments and safari companies. Harvest strategy was robust to the uncertainty in the population estimates obtained from monitoring, but poaching had a much stronger effect on quota and sustainability. Hence, reducing poaching is in the interests of companies wishing to increase the profitability of their enterprises, for example by engaging community members as game scouts. There is a threshold level of uncertainty in the population estimates beyond which the year-to-year variation in the trophy quota prevented planning by the safari companies. This suggests a role for government in ensuring that a baseline level of population monitoring is carried out such that this level is not exceeded. Our results illustrate the importance of considering the incentives of multiple stakeholders when designing frameworks for resource use and when designing management frameworks to address the particular sources of uncertainty that affect system sustainability most heavily	['SDG12']

The journal's website is at: www.sustainabilityjournal.com and the definitive version of the paper is available at: http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/ensu.12.00015There is significant potential for improving the energy efficiency of the UK’s public building stock. This will require, however, significant financial investment by local and national government, which in the current economic climate is very difficult. One way to reduce the energy consumption of public buildings without direct up-front financing is by way of an energy saving partnership (ESP), two examples of which are outlined and compared here: the Berlin Energy Saving Partnership and the London Re:fit programme. Based on these examples and on discussions with UK building retrofit specialists, this paper analyses drivers and barriers for the potential of ESPs in the UK. It emphasises that in order to minimise or prevent potential financial obstacles, strong support, and not just financial support, from local government is required	['SDG12']
10.1002/jsfa.6486	Brewer's spent grain: A valuable feedstock for industrial applications	Brewer's spent grain (BSG) is the most abundant by-product generated from the beer-brewing process, representing approximately 85% of the total by-products obtained. This material is basically constituted by the barley grain husks obtained as solid residue after the wort production. Since BSG is rich in sugars and proteins, the main and quickest alternative for elimination of this industrial by-product has been as animal feed. However, BSG is a raw material of interest for application in different areas because of its low cost, large availability throughout the year and valuable chemical composition. In the last decade, many efforts have been directed towards the reuse of BSG, taking into account the incentive that has been given to recycle the wastes and by-products generated by industrial activities. Currently, many interesting and advantageous methods for application of BSG in foods, in energy production and in chemical and biotechnological processes have been reported. The present study presents and discusses the most recent perspectives for BSG application in such areas. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry	['SDG12']

The objective of this study is to compare the environmental impacts of fabrics made of spun-dyed modal with conventionally dyed modal fabrics (for production in Austria, system ""cradle-to-factory gate""). The chosen functional unit is one kilogram of black modal knitted fabric. We assessed energy use, GHG emissions, water use and the impact categories covered by CML 2001 method. We found that the cradle to gate production of spun-dyed modal fabric has 50% lower energy use, 60% lower carbon footprint, and requires only 50% of water and has significantly lower (40–60%) environmental impacts compared to conventionally dyed fabric. Sensitivity analysis with liquor ratios and number of washing cycles does not substantially change the above results. Conventional dyeing in China leads to four-fold higher GHG emissions per kg fabric compared to spin-dyeing in Austria. Finally, we described linkages of sustainable innovation with business value creation. We showed that spin-dyeing can significantly reduce costs for value chain actors, helps reducing the environmental footprint of end products, enhances reputation of brands and retailers, and can contribute to mitigating global problems while catering for the rising demand for clothing fuelled by ever growing world population"	['SDG12']
10.1115/icem2013-96006	Waste management strategy for cost effective and environmentally friendly NPP decommissioning	Decommissioning of nuclear power plants generates large volumes of radioactive or potentially radioactive waste. The proper management of the dismantling waste plays an important role for the time needed for the dismantling phase and thus is critical to the decommissioning cost.                An efficient and thorough process for inventorying, characterization and categorization of the waste provides a sound basis for the planning process. As part of comprehensive decommissioning studies for Nordic NPPs, Westinghouse has developed the decommissioning inventories that have been used for estimations of the duration of specific work packages and the corresponding costs. As part of creating the design basis for a national repository for decommissioning waste, the total production of different categories of waste packages has also been predicted. Studsvik has developed a risk based concept for categorization and handling of the generated waste using six different categories with a span from extremely small risk for radiological contamination to high level waste. The two companies have recently joined their skills in the area of decommissioning on selected market in a consortium named ndcon to further strengthen the proposed process.                Depending on the risk for radiological contamination or the radiological properties and other properties of importance for waste management, treatment routes are proposed with well-defined and proven methods for on-site or off-site treatment, activity determination and conditioning. The system is based on a graded approach philosophy aiming for high confidence and sustainability, aiming for re-use and recycling where found applicable.                The objective is to establish a process where all dismantled material has a pre-determined treatment route. These routes should through measurements, categorization, treatment, conditioning, intermediate storage and final disposal be designed to provide a steady, un-disturbed flow of material to avoid interruptions. Bottle-necks in the process causes increased space requirements and will have negative impact on the project schedule, which increases not only the cost but also the dose exposure to personnel. For these reasons it is critical to create a process that transfers material into conditioned waste ready for disposal as quickly as possible.                To a certain extent the decommissioning program should be led by the waste management process. With the objective to reduce time for handling of dismantled material at site and to efficiently and environmental-friendly use waste management methods (clearance for re-use followed by clearance for recycling), the costs for the plant decommissioning could be reduced as well as time needed for performing the decommissioning project. Also, risks for delays would be reduced with a well-defined handling scheme which limits surprises. Delays are a major cost driver for decommissioning projects.</jats:p	['SDG12']

A planning model for an integrated waste management system based on kerbside collection is  presented. A heuristic procedure is also applied in order to obtain some admissible solutions of the real problem  in reasonable computational time. The economic and environmental impacts are considered as significant  elements for the evaluation and validation of the obtained solutions. Five alternative configurations of kerbside  system, diverging in number of sub-area, synchrony of vehicles and directionality of the arcs, are compared in an  economic point of view. Finally, Life-Cycle Assessment is used as a tool to compare the overall potential  environmental impacts of the alternative of kerbside collection systems and also to compare the kerbside system  with the traditional bring one. The different scenarios of kerbside system are comparable in terms of damage on  the impact categories, while the bring system is the worst one, in terms of damage on human health, in the  consumption of resources and also for the total damage score	['SDG12']

10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.970.67	Basalt carbon hybrid composite for wind turbine rotor blades: A short review	Wind turbine blades are the major structural element and highest cost component in the wind power system. Modern wind turbine blade sizes are increasing, and the driving motivation behind this is to increase the efficiency and energy output per unit rotor area, and to reduce the cost per kilowatt hour. However due to the increase in size the material selection for wind turbine has become critical and complex. To achieve the desired materials to improve the design of wind turbine blades several factors such as high fatigue strength, less weight, less cost and potential of recycling must be focused. Basalt fiber is a relative newcomer to fiber reinforced polymers and structural composites. Basalt fiber with their excellent mechanical properties represents an interesting alternative composite material for modern wind turbine blades. Some manufacturers claim that basalt fiber has similar or better properties than S-2 glass fiber and its cheaper than carbon fiber. Basalt fiber together with carbon fiber are the most advanced and interesting area of hybrid technologies. This paper reviews extra ordinary properties of basalt fiber over other fiber reinforced composites and highlight how the basalt special properties together with carbon fiber will reduce the weight and cost of wind turbine blades while improving their performance. This paper also demonstrates why the basalt carbon hybrid composite material will be an ideal alternative for the wind turbine rotor blades.</jats:p	['SDG12']

We adopt a nonparametric bootstrap method to reassess evidence supporting Granger causality and unravel findings of long-run unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to economic growth. This implies that energy conservation policies will negatively impact economic growth in South Africa. In addition, the results of this study have implications on CO2 emissions in South Africa given that coal accounts for about 72% of energy. This suggests that energy use would have a long run effect of raising the country's CO2 emission levels. Hence, there might be a need to develop a more balanced energy structure which will include higher share of renewable energy. A further Monte Carlo experiment performed reveals that asymptotic Granger causality test suffers size distortion problem for South African data. These findings provide support for use of a bootstrap methodology and also imply that the results presented in this study are likely to be more reliable. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1371/journal.pone.0107032	When is spillover from marine reserves likely to benefit fisheries?	The net movement of individuals from marine reserves (also known as no-take marine protected areas) to the remaining fishing grounds is known as spillover and is frequently used to promote reserves to fishers on the grounds that it will benefit fisheries. Here we consider how mismanaged a fishery must be before spillover from a reserve is able to provide a net benefit for a fishery. For our model fishery, density of the species being harvested becomes higher in the reserve than in the fished area but the reduction in the density and yield of the fished area was such that the net effect of the closure was negative, except when the fishery was mismanaged. The extent to which effort had to exceed traditional management targets before reserves led to a spillover benefit varied with rates of growth and movement of the model species. In general, for well-managed fisheries, the loss of yield from the use of reserves was less for species with greater movement and slower growth. The spillover benefit became more pronounced with increasing mis-management of the stocks remaining available to the fishery. This model-based result is consistent with the literature of field-based research where a spillover benefit from reserves has only been detected when the fishery is highly depleted, often where traditional fisheries management controls are absent. We conclude that reserves in jurisdictions with well-managed fisheries are unlikely to provide a net spillover benefit	['SDG12']

10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.06.003	Energy and emissions benefits of renewable energy derived from municipal solid waste: Analysis of a low carbon scenario in Malaysia	Ineffective waste management that involves dumping of waste in landfills may degrade valuable land resources and emit methane gas (CH4), a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO2). The incineration of waste also emits polluted chemicals such as dioxin and particle. Therefore, from a solid waste management perspective, both landfilling and incineration practices pose challenges to the development of a green and sustainable future. Waste-to-energy (WtE) has become a promising strategy catering to these issues because the utilisation of waste reduces the amount of landfilled waste (overcoming land resource issues) while increasing renewable energy production. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the energy and carbon reduction potential in Malaysia for various WtE strategies for municipal solid waste (MSW). The material properties of the MSW, its energy conversion potential and subsequent greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions are analysed based on the chemical compositions and biogenic Carbon fractions of the waste. The GHG emission reduction potential is also calculated by considering fossil fuel displacement and CH4 avoidance from landfilling. In this paper, five different scenarios are analysed with results indicating a integration of landfill gas (LFG) recovery systems and waste incinerator as the major and minor WtE strategies shows the highest economical benefit with optimal GHG mitigation and energy potential. Sensitivity analysis on the effect of moisture content of MSW towards energy potential and GHG emissions are performed. These evaluations of WtE strategies provides valuable insights for policy decision in MSW management practices with cost effective, energy benefit, environmental protection.</p	['SDG12']

Design/methodology/approach                 – A one-group pretest posttest study was used to evaluate a two-hour workshop in which 30 participants were instructed in sustainability education and behavior change strategies. Participants implemented self-management strategies and tracked their energy use every week for two weeks following the pro-e training.                                           Findings                 – A significant difference between participants’ baseline and Week 2 energy use assessments was found. The results suggest that the pro-e training increased participants’ energy conservation behavior for their targeted device. Moreover, participants decreased their energy usage for other measured electronic devices, suggesting generalization of treatment effects.                                           Research limitations/implications                 – A sizable savings in energy was realized across all participants and devices (approximately 300 hours). However, there was no control group in this one-group pretest posttest study and the effect of reactivity cannot be discounted.                                           Practical implications                 – This research suggests that behavior change strategies may be effective at improving pro-e behaviors. The relative ease and low cost of delivering the instruction, and minimal effort on the part of the participant to make behavior changes, provides a solid foundation from which to disseminate sustainability education.

10.1021/ie504881c	Alternative Petlyuk distillation configurations for the separation of four-component mixtures	ABSTRACT: The Petlyuk configuration represents an attractive alternative to the simple distillation column sequences because of its potential in energy saving. This point was extensively discussed for three-component mixtures. Moving to quaternary mixtures the complexity of the Petlyuk configuration represents the main barrier of its possible implementation in the industrial practice. In the present work, a set of new alternative distillation configurations to the four-component Petlyuk is presented. A hydrocarbon and an alcohol mixture are considered to prove their applicability. The total annual cost, together with the thermodynamic efficiency and the carbon dioxide emissions, are considered as comparison index between the Petlyuk and the alternative configurations. The results obtained proved that for the cases considered at least one of the alternative configurations showed a better or at least the same performance of the Petlyuk arrangement. For this reason, the new configurations are worth of consideration when four-component mixtures are considered. 1	['SDG12']

The indicators are meant to monitor changes in the provision of ecosystem services at a local scale (forest management unit, FMU). We support that if a forest provides a bundle of ecosystem services its management can be considered sustainable; thus, we adjust C&I to an ecosystem services classification.     Area of study: La Hunde y La Palomera, a public FMU in the region of Valencia (east of Spain), 100km southwest of the city of Valencia.     Material and methods: first, a literature review of the following themes took part: SFM, features of Mediterranean forests, ecosystem services and C&I. Some C&I were proposed and, later on, a participatory process in Ayora, the municipality where the mentioned FMU is located, was carried out with different stakeholders (forestry professionals, users for recreation, hunters, environmentalists and professionals of cultural and rural development activities) in order for them to value the C&I proposed according to their management preferences for La Hunde y La Palomera.     Research highlights:     15 criteria and 133 indicators were identified: a balance has been achieved among economic, social and ecological concerns.   People value the ecological issues associated to forestry on top and the economic ones at the bottom.   Results suggest that SFM under Mediterranean conditions is based on more than one product and on the provision of several ecosystem services	['SDG12']

However, many people believe that being fashionable and being environmentally conscious are in direct conflict, and they question whether these two concepts can coexist. The results of a questionnaire survey of 327 consumers from South Korea show that consumers’ involvement in fashion is not necessarily linked to their intention to buy and consume sustainable fashion. This finding motivated us to investigate whether there are any barriers that restrict the popularization of sustainable fashion and, if so, how we can solve such a problem. From this perspective, an in-depth interview study was conducted to consolidate the views of five fashion professionals to reveal the major barriers to popularization. The ultimate goal is to explore solutions to bridge the gap between the supply and demand for sustainable fashion. The findings of this study extend our understanding of consumers’ attitude toward two conflicting values – fashionism and environmentalism, as well as the popularization barriers of sustainable fashion. This understanding is imperative to the promotion of the green movement in the fashion industry, particularly in Asian countries.Institute of Textiles and Clothin	['SDG12']

A thermodynamic analysis is presented for the proposed trigeneration systems considering an 815 kWe diesel generator (DG) as a prime mover. Two configurations are considered. One configuration includes absorption chiller with an auxiliary hot water heater, while the other has a compression chiller in addition to the absorption chiller and water heater. Methodology of integrating a compression chiller is also presented. An analysis of both these options on primary energy savings basis for the considered DG shows that integrating a thermal storage and compression chiller enhances trigeneration performance. Without the compression chiller, the trigeneration system efficiency improves from 46% to 52% while with compression chiller integration, the improvement is much more from 46% to 72% when the power load decreases from 100% to 25%	['SDG12']

Pullout tests were adopted to evaluate the bonding and debonding behaviors of the embedded rebar experiencing different corrosion levels. Both high- and low-strength concrete were considered. Bond-slip curves were recorded to determine the influences of rebar corrosion levels and RCA replacements on the bond strength and debonding energy of the specimens. Test results indicate that increasing rebar corrosion level gradually weakens the antisliding ability of reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) except for a small level corrosion and the degradation rate of ultimate bond strength increases with a decrease of compressive strength at 0.5% rebar corrosion. The results also demonstrate that the ultimate bond strength of reinforced RAC slightly decreases with an increase of RCA replacement. However, the relative bond strength between uncorroded rebar and RAC is little affected by RCA content, while it decreases with an increase of RCA replacement in high-strength specimens after rebar corrosion. The debonding energy between deformed rebar and RAC is found decreasing with the increment of the rebar corrosion level and increasing with an increase of RAC content.</jats:p	['SDG12']
10.3390/su70912539	Sustainable urban development calls for responsibility through life cycle management	Urban development bestows a great opportunity to increase sustainability in the built environment as cities are responsible for the majority of environmental impacts. However, the urban development process is fragmented and sub-optimization leads to unsustainable life cycle outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the urban development process from a life cycle perspective and identify how different actors understand life cycle management. By utilizing an inductive qualitative research design, 38 in-depth thematic interviews were conducted within the Finnish urban development industry including a case study and independent interviews from different phases of the urban development life cycle. The theoretical perspective is a combination of the ecosystem construct and life cycle management. Results show that there is no clear responsible actor for life cycle management in urban development. All actors claim that there is value to be added, mostly in economic, but also environmental and social terms. This study reveals that investors should be the responsible actor in the urban development process. By claiming responsibility and focusing on life cycle leadership we can improve sustainability in urban development, and respond to the urban sustainability challenge, thus improving the quality of life and welfare in our urban society	['SDG12']

10.1007/s12053-015-9421-8	An intelligent system for the climate control and energy savings in agricultural greenhouses	A greenhouse for crop production is a complex thermodynamic system where the indoor temperature and the humidity conditions have a great impact on the crop yields. This system can be considered a multivariable input output system MIMO. This paper aims at presenting a physical model of a greenhouse, experimentally validated, in order to propose a fuzzy-based controller to manage the indoor climate of a greenhouse using some actuators (induction motors, heating system etc....) for ventilation, heating, humidifying, and dehumidifying purposes. In addition, a novel approach is presented for energy management by involving the photovoltaic energy in order to minimize the use of conventional electrical grid and to lower costs of agriculture production. The photovoltaic (PV) generator will serve to power a direct torque control (DTC) controlled induction motor which drive a variable speed fan. The validation of the physical model shows a high agreement with the experimental measurement. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy controller as well as the PV generator for saving the energy and lowering the costs of crop production into greenhouses	['SDG12']

10.1016/j.scs.2016.05.011	Social sustainability of renewable energy sources in electricity production: An application of the contingent valuation method	"Article in press; ""Available online 20 May 2016""Sustainability is frequently defined by its three pillars: environmental, economic and social. Consequently the evaluation of the sustainability of a decision, public or private, requires information on these three dimensions. This paper focuses on social sustainability. In the context of renewable energy sources, the consideration of social sustainability requires the analysis of not only the efficiency but also the equity of the welfare impacts, including spatially differentiated impacts. The present paper proposes and applies a methodology to generate the information necessary to conduct a more complete welfare analysis of the social sustainability of renewable energy production facilities, so that equity considerations are treated alongside efficiency issues. The analysis focuses on the case of investments in renewable energy electricity production facilities, where the impacts on local residents’ welfare are often significantly different from the welfare effects on the general population. We apply the contingent valuation method to specific facilities across the different renewable energy sources in operation in Portugal and conclude that local residents acknowledge the damage sustained differently depending on the type, location and operation of the facilities. The results from these case studies attest to the need of acknowledging and quantifying the negative impacts on local communities so as to be able to assess the social sustainability of renewable energy projects, alongside the two other pillars of sustainability.The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from FCT Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia with grant number PTDC/EGE-ECO/122402/2010"	['SDG12']

Design/methodology/approach Literature is replete with sustainability models for business; however, few of these models are specific to the industrial supply chain market sector. The authors propose a novel approach for comparing/normalizing data from all three components of the Triple Bottom Line (3BL) sustainability model.   Findings A shortcoming of the 3BL sustainability model has been that the data cannot be easily normalized and compared across the three categories of the model. The findings of this paper suggest that it may be possible to develop a model that includes both environmental and social responsibility scales, combined with the more traditional financial data, as a tool for competitive advantage using generalizable data.   Practical implications As the industrial companies continue to put increasing pressure on both the upstream and downstream suppliers in their supply chain to demonstrate sound sustainability practice, this model could serve to provide a company with competitive advantage.   Originality/value This paper proposes a novel approach to assessing environmental, social and financial impact as a tool for competitive advantage. </jats:sec	['SDG12']

These syntheses accomplished high yields using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent, L-(+)-tartaric acid as a new surfactant and antioxidant, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent. The input of extra inert gases was not necessary and this method is very simple and green. Some reaction parameters, such as amount of reactants or surfactant, pH, reaction time or rate and amount of reduction reagent, were effective for control in the size and shape of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, colloidal copper nanoparticles effectively catalytically degrade methyl orange. The synthesis method reported in this work might be useful for the large-scale production of Cu nanoparticles. </jats:p	['SDG12']

In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to assess the environmental impacts of two hypothetical coupled aquaponics systems (CAPS): Raft System (RAFT) and Media-Filled Beds System (MFBS). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were considered as cultivated species in both systems. The Simapro© software V.8.0 was used for calculation. The comparison between the two virtual systems indicated the floating technique as the less impacting one. Even though energy consumption appears to be higher in the floating system, LCA results were markedly influenced by the extensive use of inert materials in MFSB. In both systems, contribution analyses underlined that the main environmental impacts are related to infrastructures, electricity and fish feed. The LCA analyses carried out in this study highlights that the choice of less impacting materials, and the optimization of management practices, should be taken as priorities in order to reduce environmental impacts of this activity	['SDG12']

10.1016/j.procir.2017.03.041	Lifecycle Management of Product-service Systems: A Preliminary Investigation of a White Goods Manufacturer	© 2017 The Authors. Product-Service Systems (PSS) have been discussed as promising business strategies towards a circular economy (CE). However, PSS solutions are not necessarily more sustainable. PSS lifecycle management may play an important role to improve the offering and achieve sustainability benefits. Nevertheless, bottom-up issues for CE implementation in the industry such as lifecycle management are still little discussed in the literature. In this sense, this paper aims to explore a PSS business strategy adopted by a large white goods manufacturer that transitioned from a linear to a circular business, and the practices applied throughout the entire lifecycle that may be valuable to achieve CE requirements. A case-based approach was employed in this study and multiple sources of evidence were considered. Data were analyzed in the light of the literature, considering an inductive approach. The main preliminary findings suggest that resources consumption reduction and cost savings can be obtained through lifecycle management practices that take into consideration CE issues since the beginning of life of the PSS offering. Design practices, the adoption of different strategies at the end of life (reuse/remanufacturing or recycle), and the implementation of cleaner production practices are some of the identified practices that can contribute to achieve resource efficiency and CE requirements. This is a work in progress and further work is going to focus on a quantitative analysis of the environmental and economic performance of this PSS. In addition, as this study focused on a use-oriented PSS, future research may compare lifecycle management practices adopted by other and distinct PSS categories, and how different lifecycle management practices may contribute to achieving resource efficiency	['SDG12']

10.1002/ieam.1760	Comparison of different building shells - life cycle assessment	The REACT (Renewable Energy & Efficiency Action) project is an EU-funded cross-border cooperative venture featuring the participation of companies and researchers from Burgenland (Austria) and western Slovakia that is developing zero energy concepts for newly built single-family homes. A variety of building structures are defined for family houses, and the different impacts they have on the environment are evaluated over the entire life cycle. This paper aims to compare the environmental impacts of different building shells during both the construction and the demolition phases. However, the operation phase of the building is not evaluated. One of the findings of the project thus far is that the demolition and disposal of building materials should be included in any such evaluation. For some environmental impact assessment categories, both demolition and disposal are important. The environmental impacts of various end-of-life scenarios can differ greatly based on the disposal method (e.g., landfill, incineration, recycling, etc.) chosen and on the proportion of recycled content. Furthermore, the results show that manufacturing building materials from renewable resources can have strong environmental impacts, particularly when substantial amounts of fossil fuel are required in their production.Forschung BurgenlandEnergie-Umweltmanagemen	['SDG12']

10.3390/su10020162	The impact of socio-economic indicators on sustainable consumption of domestic electricity in Lithuania	Lithuania is one of the EU Member States, where the rate of energy consumption is comparatively low but consumption of electricity has been gradually increasing over the last few years. Despite this trend, households in only three EU Member States consume less electricity than Lithuanian households. The purpose of this research is to analyse the impact of socio-economic factors on the domestic electricity consumption in Lithuania, i.e., to establish whether electricity consumption is determined by socio-economic conditions or population’s awareness to save energy. Cointegration analysis, causality test and error-correction model were used for the analysis. The results reveal that there is a long run equilibrium relationship between residential electricity consumption per capita and GDP at current prices as well as the ratio of the registered unemployed to the working-age population. In consequence, the results of the research propose that improvement of living standards for Lithuanian community calls for the necessity to pay particular attention to the promotion of sustainable electricity consumption by providing consumers with appropriate information and feedback in order to seek new energy-related consumption practices	['SDG12']

10.5278/ijsepm.2017.14.4	The effect of price regulation on the performances of industrial symbiosis: A case study on district heating	This study of the district heating system of Aalborg (Denmark) analyses how fiscal instruments affect the extent excess heat recovery helps reduce the carbon footprint of heat. It builds on a supply-and-demand framework and characterizes the changes in excess heat supply with consequential life cycle assessment in reference to one gigajoule distributed. The heat supply curve is defined through ten scenarios, which represent incremental shares of excess heat as the constraints of the said legal instruments are lifted. The heat demand curve follows the end-users’ response to price changes. The most ambitious scenario doubles the amount of excess heat supplied and reduces the heat carbon footprint by 90% compared to current level, for an end-user price increase of 41%. The price increase results from a higher supply of excess heat at a higher price and an unchanged purchase cost from the coal-fired CHP plant despite a lower supply. This highlights the necessity of a flexible supplier when the share of recovered excess heat is high	['SDG12']
10.3390/su10030671	Sustainable and low greenhouse gas emitting rice production in Latin America and the Caribbean: A review on the transition from ideality to reality	The burgeoning demand for rice in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) exceeds supply, resulting in a rice deficit. To overcome this challenge, rice production should be increased, albeit sustainably. However, since rice production is associated with increases in the atmospheric concentration of two greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), the challenge is on ensuring that production increases are not associated with an increase in GHG emissions and thus do not cause an increase in GHG emission intensities. Based on current understanding of drivers of CH4 and N2O production, we provide here insights on the potential climate change mitigation benefits of management and technological options (i.e., seeding, tillage, irrigation, residue management) pursued in the LAC region. Studies conducted in the LAC region show intermittent irrigation or alternate wetting and drying of rice fields to reduce CH4 emissions by 25–70% without increasing N2O emissions. Results on yield changes associated with intermittent irrigation remain inconclusive. Compared to conventional tillage, no-tillage and anticipated tillage (i.e., fall tillage) cause a 21% and 25% reduction in CH4 emissions, respectively. From existing literature, it was unambiguous that the mitigation potential of most management strategies pursued in the LAC region need to be quantified while acknowledging country-specific conditions. While breeding high yielding and low emitting rice varieties may represent the most promising and possibly sustainable approach for achieving GHG emission reductions without demanding major changes in on-farm management practices, this is rather idealistic. We contend that a more realistic approach for realizing low GHG emitting rice production systems is to focus on increasing rice yields, for obvious food security reasons, which, while not reducing absolute emissions, should translate to a reduction in GHG emission intensities. Moreover, there is need to explore creative ways of incentivizing the adoption of promising combinations of management and technological options	['SDG12']

10.1016/j.enpol.2018.03.058	Learn to conserve: The effects of in-school energy education on at-home electricity consumption	Environmental education for school students, including lessons on recycling, water conservation, and energy reduction, is a popular measure aimed at increasing environmental knowledge, promoting environmental attitudes, and increasing pro-environmental behaviors. Despite the prevalence of such education, there is little empirical evidence to support the efficacy of these programs on tangible outcomes outside of school. This paper contributes an empirical analysis of a series of energy lessons in the United States. Using a differences-in-differences approach with a rich panel data set, we find evidence for short-term reductions on the order of eight percent in electricity use the day of a lesson regarding energy conservation via reducing phantom electric loads (standby power), with evidence of deferment in electricity use rather than true conservation. We find no effect of lessons on energy pathways or wind energy on the days of the lessons. Despite limited evidence of conservation, our results do indicate a connection between lessons learned in school and measurable behavior at home. Importantly, this research indicates that energy education could be a potentially valuable tool for policy regarding energy conservation and efficiency, though future research is needed to optimize the timing and content of such lessons	['SDG12']

10.3390/su10041061	Closed-loop supply chain planning model of rare metals	Rare metals (RMs) are becoming increasingly important in high-tech industries associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as the electric vehicle (EV) and 3D printer industries. As the growth of these industries accelerates in the near future, manufacturers will also face greater RM supply risks. For this reason, many countries are putting considerable effort into securing the RM supply. For example, countries including Japan, Korea, and the USA have adopted two major policies: the stockpile system and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Therefore, it is necessary for the manufacturers with RMs to establish a suitable supply chain plan that reflects this situation. In this study, the RM classification matrix is created based on the stockpile and recycling level in Korea. Accordingly, three different types of supply chain are designed in order to develop the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) planning model of RM, and the CLSC planning models of RM are validated through experimental analysis. The results show that the stockpiling and the EPR recycling obligation increase the amount of recycled flow and reduce the total cost of the part manufacturing, which means that these two factors are significant for obtaining sustainability of the RMs’ CLSC. In addition, the government needs to set an appropriate sharing cost for promoting the manufacturer’s recycling. Also, from the manufacturer’s perspective, it is better to increase the return rate by making a contract with the collectors to guarantee the collection of used products	['SDG12']

10.1016/j.envsci.2018.04.011	Carbon and material footprints of a welfare state: Why and how governments should enhance green investments	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation have become guiding policy principles in many welfare states. However, the traditional role of a welfare state is to guarantee the economic stability, jobs and welfare for its citizens. Sustainable development leans on the idea that we can have economic, social and environmental sustainability at the same time. This would require decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. Decoupling should be studied globally, because within nations, the economy can grow while local environmental impacts decrease, but at the same time, global environmental impacts may increase due to international trade. In this study, we examine the consumption-based carbon and material footprints of a Nordic welfare state, Finland. We focus on the environmental impacts of public spending, which has received little attention previously. In welfare states, the reallocation of public funds to services and individuals are at its core. In the study, we examine how this affects the carbon and material footprints of various income groups and household types. We find that the share of public services and investments is 19% of the carbon footprint and 38% of the material footprint per capita. Building of infrastructure plays a major role in composing the material footprint. We also find that the welfare state has important features that improve the carbon equity between the citizens. To achieve absolute decoupling, required to reduce environmental impacts caused by economic activities, we suggest policies promoting public and private green investments. In addition, increased carbon pricing would enhance green investments and drive environmental innovation.We would like to thank the following organizations for making the study possible: Aalto University School of Engineering and the University of Iceland’s Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

Drawing on in-depth qualitative fieldwork from a mixed-method study of knowledge in Connemara, the paper argues that local understandings of sustainability which prioritise lay knowledge for future generations both helps and hinders successful environmental participation. These definitions of sustainability are central to how community actors define what constitutes effective environmental participation. Many established locals draw upon these sustainability ideals to justify the deliberate exclusion of recent settlers to the area from environmental participatory forums. Insights revealed here on how local cultural conventions pertaining to language use, ‘defensive localism’ and insider–outsider distinctions affect participation in rural Ireland are highly significant for understanding barriers to effective environmental governance and the complexity of local perceptions of participation, sustainability and policy-making	['SDG12']

This study builds upon the literature regarding customer interest in sustainable products. It adds the country of origin to the link between customer and company, and analyzes if and how customer perceptions change when they are introduced to a sustainability scandal, hence analyzing possible ‘association by guilt’. It compares their reactions to offshore scandals and to local scandals, therefore taking psychic distance as an important variable into consideration. Customer perceptions of company sustainability was found to have an impact on purchasing behavior. Findings show that perceptions are influenced by psychic distance. Furthermore, companies should take into account the risk of association by guilt when developing their global sourcing strategies.</jats:p	['SDG12']

10.3390/en11082001	Development and optimization of a building energy simulation model to study the effect of greenhouse design parameters	Energy management of the greenhouse is considered to be one of the most important challenges of greenhouse farming. Energy saving measures need considered, besides applying energy supplying techniques. To address this issue, a model was developed to simulate the thermal environment of a greenhouse using a Transient Systems Simulation Program (TRNSYS 17) as a building energy simulation (BES) platform. The model was calibrated by modifying the input parameters to minimize the uncertainties obtained from the results. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0.958 and 0.983 showed good agreement between the computed and experimental results. The proposed model was used to evaluate the effects of greenhouse design parameters, including roof shape, orientation, double-glazing, natural ventilation, coverings and their thickness, on its energy conservation capacity. It was found that the most suitable design for a greenhouse located in Daegu (latitude 35.53° N, longitude 128.36° E) South Korea would be east-west (E-W) oriented, with a gothic-shaped roof and double-glazing of PMMA (Polymethylmethacrylate) covering. Natural ventilation reduced the inside temperature of greenhouse, thereby reducing the energy demand of cooling. The model developed can help greenhouse farmers and researchers make pre-design decisions regarding greenhouse construction, taking their local environment and specific needs into consideration.</jats:p	['SDG12']

It not only draws attention to the disconnect between reporting on an important environmental issue and the sense of commitment to environmental responsibility, but also shows that over time, organisations are becoming more proactive about biodiversity reporting.Design/methodology/approachThe research uses a content analysis of sustainability and integrated reports and organised hypocrisy as a theoretical framework for analysing biodiversity-related disclosures.FindingsConsistent with an organised hypocrisy framework, the research finds that the several companies rely on corporate reporting to emphasise actions and internal management strategies that are already producing favourable results. In contrast, mission statements, firm policy commitments and forward-looking analysis are avoided. There is, however, evidence to suggest that the gaps between corporate reporting and action may be giving companies the time to reform their practices, align biodiversity disclosures with genuine corporate action and move towards truly integrated business models.Research limitations/implicationsPoor biodiversity reporting raises questions about the extent to which companies are managing serious environmental issues that can have a direct impact on their business models. Improvements in biodiversity reporting also suggest that corporate reporting is maturing and that some organisations are beginning to understand the need for managing their biodiversity impact.Originality/valueThe paper offers empirical evidence on how the disconnect between organisational rhetoric and action is used to manage stakeholder expectations and negate the need for environmental reforms. In this manner, organised hypocrisy is framed as a specific legitimisation strategy. The research also shows that organised hypocrisy is not absolute; despite the opportunity to engage in organised hypocrisy, some companies are taking a more proactive approach to biodiversity reporting. As a result, it may be appropriate to see organised hypocrisy as part of a transition to higher quality integrated or sustainability reporting.</jats:sec	['SDG12']

10.3390/ma11122439	Manufacture of sustainable clay bricks using waste from secondary aluminum recycling as raw material	The aluminum recycling industry produces aluminum filter dust (AFD), a waste byproduct of the aluminum recycling process composed mainly of aluminum oxide in a percentage between 60–70%, 8% calcium oxide, almost 15% sodium chloride, and between 5–10% potassium chloride. Due to its aluminum content, this waste can be used as a raw material in the manufacture of ceramic bricks, at the same time reducing the environmental impact produced in landfill. In this work, the partial substitution of a clay mixture (40% black, 30% red, and 30% yellow clay) by different proportions of AFD in the range 0–25 wt % for the production of fired clay brick was studied. The raw materials, clays, and waste were characterized by XRF and XRD. The brick specimens were fired at 950 °C and their physical and mechanical properties, such as water absorption, water suction, loss of ignition, linear shrinkage, bulk density, and compressive strength, were analyzed. The more relevant results were obtained with the addition of up to 20 wt % AFD, obtaining bricks with physical properties comparable to pure clay-based bricks used as a reference and better compressive strength and thermal conductivity due to the balance between the melting and pore-forming effects of the waste. These sustainable bricks also comply with the regulations of heavy metals leached to the environment, as indicated by the leaching test.</jats:p	['SDG12']

The beginning of the twenty-first century has been marked by the growth of the population of the brown bear and its occurrence in unusual habitats.

The impacts of climate variability on hydrological processes have been removed for wet and dry periods, respectively, so that we focus on the impacts of human activities (i.e., dam construction). The results indicate that: (1) along the East River, dams have greatly altered the natural flow regime, range condition and spatial variability; (2) six most remarkable indicators of hydrologic alteration induced by dam-construction are rise rate (1.16), 3-day maximum (0.91), low pulse duration (0.88), January (0.80), July (0.80) and February (0.79) mean flow of the East River during 1952-2002; and (3) spatiotemporal hydrologic alterations are different among three stations along Easter River. Under the influence of dam construction in the upstream, the degree of hydrologic changes from Lingxia, Heyuan to Longchuan station increases. This study reveals that visualization techniques for high-dimensional hydrological datasets together with RVA are beneficial for detecting spatio-temporal hydrologic changes.</p	['SDG13']

Simulations with a highly resolved domain positioned over North America and over the tropical Pacific–eastern Indian Ocean are assessed against the GEM uniform grid control run, 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), and available observations in terms of regional and global climate and interannual variability.                It is found that the variable-resolution configurations realistically simulate global and regional climate over North America with seasonal means and variability generally closer to ERA-40 or observations than the control run. Systematic errors of the control run are still present within the variable-resolution simulations but alleviated to some extent over their respective highly resolved domains. Additionally, there is some evidence of performance deterioration due to the increased resolution.                There is little evidence that an increased resolution over the tropical Pacific–eastern Indian Ocean, with better-resolved local processes (e.g., convection and equatorial waves), has a significant impact on the extratropical time mean fields. However, in terms of simulating the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric flow anomaly associated with the dominant mode of sea surface temperature interannual variability in the equatorial eastern Pacific (i.e., El Niño), both stretched configurations have more realistic teleconnection patterns than the control run.</jats:p	['SDG13']

Drawing upon the CAVIAR framework for analysing current and future exposure-sensitivity and adaptive capacity in Gallivare municipality, northern Sweden, this chapter describes the socio-economic and environmental context of, and current and potential adaptations to, changes in forestry, reindeer husbandry, and winter tourism. The chapter concludes that these land use sectors are impacted by considerable economic and market pressures, with the result that conflicts between sectors have become increasingly pronounced. While climate change will eventually affect all land use sectors, impacts may be felt most immediately by those with the smallest existing margins for their activities, such as reindeer husbandry.</p	['SDG13']

10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.047	Spatial variation of emissions impacts due to renewable energy siting decisions in the Western U.S. under high-renewable penetration scenarios	One of the policy goals motivating programs to increase renewable energy investment is that renewable electric generation will help reduce emissions of CO(2) as well as emissions of conventional pollutants (e.g., SO(2) and NO(x)). As a policy instrument, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) encourage investments in wind, solar and other generation sources with the goal of reducing air emissions from electricity production. Increased electricity production from wind turbines is expected to displace electricity production from fossil-fired plants, thus reducing overall system emissions. We analyze the emissions impacts of incremental investments in utility-scale wind power, on the order of 1 GW beyond RPS goals, in the Western United States using a utility-scale generation dispatch model that incorporates the impacts of transmission constraints. We find that wind investment in some locations leads to slight increases in overall emissions of CO(2), SO(2) and NO(x). The location of wind farms influences the environmental impact by changing the utilization of transmission assets, which affects the overall utilization of power generation sources and thus system-level emissions. Our results suggest that renewable energy policy beyond RPS targets should be carefully crafted to ensure consistency with environmental goals.

10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05203.x	Impact of climate change on risk of incursion of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in livestock in Europe through migratory birds	To predict the risk of incursion of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in livestock in Europe introduced through immature Hyalomma marginatum ticks on migratory birds under current conditions and in the decade 2075-2084 under a climate-change scenario. A spatial risk map of Europe comprising 14 282 grid cells (25 × 25 km) was constructed using three data sources: (i) ranges and abundances of four species of bird which migrate from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe each spring, namely Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), Northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis) and Common quail (Coturnix coturnix); (ii) UK Met Office HadRM3 spring temperatures for prediction of moulting success of immature H. marginatum ticks and (iii) livestock densities. On average, the number of grid cells in Europe predicted to have at least one CCHFV incursion in livestock in spring was 1·04 per year for the decade 2005-2014 and 1·03 per year for the decade 2075-2084. In general with the assumed climate-change scenario, the risk increased in northern Europe but decreased in central and southern Europe, although there is considerable local variation in the trends. The absolute risk of incursion of CCHFV in livestock through ticks introduced by four abundant species of migratory bird (totalling 120 million individual birds) is very low. Climate change has opposing effects, increasing the success of the moult of the nymphal ticks into adults but decreasing the projected abundance of birds by 34% in this model. For Europe, climate change is not predicted to increase the overall risk of incursion of CCHFV in livestock through infected ticks introduced by these four migratory bird species	['SDG13']

Human activity has changed the natural environment to a point where the viability of many ecosystems is now under threat. There are already many descriptions of how changes in biological patterns are correlated with environmental changes. The next important step is to determine the causative relationship between environmental variability and biological systems. Physiology provides the mechanistic link between environmental change and ecological patterns.

10.1371/journal.pone.0039634	Habitat specialization in tropical continental shelf demersal fish assemblages	The implications of shallow water impacts such as fishing and climate change on fish assemblages are generally considered in isolation from the distribution and abundance of these fish assemblages in adjacent deeper waters. We investigate the abundance and length of demersal fish assemblages across a section of tropical continental shelf at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, to identify fish and fish habitat relationships across steep gradients in depth and in different benthic habitat types. The assemblage composition of demersal fish were assessed from baited remote underwater stereo-video samples (n = 304) collected from 16 depth and habitat combinations. Samples were collected across a depth range poorly represented in the literature from the fringing reef lagoon (1-10 m depth), down the fore reef slope to the reef base (10-30 m depth) then across the adjacent continental shelf (30-110 m depth). Multivariate analyses showed that there were distinctive fish assemblages and different sized fish were associated with each habitat/depth category. Species richness, MaxN and diversity declined with depth, while average length and trophic level increased. The assemblage structure, diversity, size and trophic structure of demersal fishes changes from shallow inshore habitats to deeper water habitats. More habitat specialists (unique species per habitat/depth category) were associated with the reef slope and reef base than other habitats, but offshore sponge-dominated habitats and inshore coral-dominated reef also supported unique species. This suggests that marine protected areas in shallow coral-dominated reef habitats may not adequately protect those species whose depth distribution extends beyond shallow habitats, or other significant elements of demersal fish biodiversity. The ontogenetic habitat partitioning which is characteristic of many species, suggests that to maintain entire species life histories it is necessary to protect corridors of connected habitats through which fish can migrate	['SDG13']

This distinct RF leads to −0.1K surface temperature decrease in Chinese mainland, which includes −0.26K drop of daily maximum and 0.07K rise of minimum temperature. Air column temperature has also been increased 0.11K in Chinese mainland. Significant vapor and precipitation increase can be resulted from RF of carbonaceous aerosol in north China and the Yellow and Huai River basin, accompanied by the decrease in northeast China, far-east region, and Tibet Plateau	['SDG13']

10.1002/ece3.197	Projected changes in distributions of Australian tropical savanna birds under climate change using three dispersal scenarios	"Identifying the species most vulnerable to extinction as a result of climate change is a necessary first step in mitigating biodiversity decline. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a commonly used tool to assess potential climate change impacts on distributions of species. We use SDMs to predict geographic ranges for 243 birds of Australian tropical savannas, and to project changes in species richness and ranges under a future climate scenario between 1990 and 2080. Realistic predictions require recognition of the variability in species capacity to track climatically suitable environments. Here we assess the effect of dispersal on model results by using three approaches: full dispersal, no dispersal and a partial-dispersal scenario permitting species to track climate change at a rate of 30 km per decade. As expected, the projected distributions and richness patterns are highly sensitive to the dispersal scenario. Projected future range sizes decreased for 66% of species if full dispersal was assumed, but for 89% of species when no dispersal was assumed. However, realistic future predictions should not assume a single dispersal scenario for all species and as such, we assigned each species to the most appropriate dispersal category based on individual mobility and habitat specificity; this permitted the best estimates of where species will be in the future. Under this ""realistic"" dispersal scenario, projected ranges sizes decreased for 67% of species but showed that migratory and tropical-endemic birds are predicted to benefit from climate change with increasing distributional area. Richness hotspots of tropical savanna birds are expected to move, increasing in southern savannas and southward along the east coast of Australia, but decreasing in the arid zone. Understanding the complexity of effects of climate change on species' range sizes by incorporating dispersal capacities is a crucial step toward developing adaptation policies for the conservation of vulnerable species"	['SDG13']

10.1175/jamc-d-11-0117.1	A Dynamic method for gap filling in daily temperature datasets	AbstractA regression-based approach for temperature data reconstruction has been used to fill the gaps in the series of automatic temperature records obtained from the meteorological network of Veneto Region (northeastern Italy). The method presented is characterized by a dynamic selection of the reconstructing stations and of the coupling period that can precede or follow the missing data. Each gap is considered as a specific case, identifying the best set of stations and the period that minimizes the estimated reconstruction error for the gap, thus permitting a potentially better adaptation to time-dependent factors affecting the relationships between stations. The best sampling size is determined through an inference procedure, permitting a highly specific selection of the parameters used to fill each gap in the time series. With a proper selection of the parameters, the average errors of reconstruction are close to 0 and those corresponding to the 95th percentile are typically around 0.1°C. In comparison with similar regression-based approaches, the errors are lower, particularly for minimum temperatures, and the method limits inversions between the minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures	['SDG13']

Therefore, an increase in the prescription of antidepressants and anxiolytics could be an indicator of general psychological distress in the community.PurposeThe purpose of this study was to determine if there was a change in the rate of prescription of antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs following Cyclone Yasi.MethodsA quantitative evaluation of new prescriptions of antidepressants and anxiolytics was conducted. The total number of new prescriptions for these drugs was calculated for the period six months after the cyclone and compared with the same six month period in the preceding year. Two control drugs were also included to rule out changes in the general rate of drug prescription in the affected communities.ResultsAfter Cyclone Yasi, there was an increase in the prescription of antidepressant drugs across all age and gender groups in the affected communities except for males 14-54 years of age. The prescription of anxiolytic drugs decreased immediately after the cyclone, but increased by the end of the six-month post-cyclone period. Control drug prescription did not change.ConclusionThere was a quantifiable increase in the prescription of antidepressant drugs following Cyclone Yasi that may indicate an increase in psychosocial distress in the community.UsherK, BrownLH, BuettnerP, GlassB, BoonH, WestC, GrassoJ, Chamberlain-SalaunJ, WoodsC.

However, little is known about which factors predict engagement with climate change, and which messaging strategies are most effective. A community sample of 324 residents from three regions in British Columbia read information either about a climate change impact relevant to their local area, a more global one, or, in a control condition, no message. Participants indicated the extent of their climate change engagement, the strength of their attachment to their local area, and demographic information. Three significant unique predictors of climate change engagement emerged: place attachment, receiving the local message, and gender (female). These results provide empirical support for some previously proposed barriers to climate action and suggest guidelines for effective climate change communication. </jats:p	['SDG13']

10.5194/cp-9-605-2013	Last interglacial temperature evolution - A model inter-comparison	There is a growing number of proxy-based reconstructions detailing the climatic changes that occurred during the last interglacial period (LIG). This period is of special interest, because large parts of the globe were characterized by a warmer-than-present-day climate, making this period an interesting test bed for climate models in light of projected global warming. However, mainly because synchronizing the different palaeoclimatic records is difficult, there is no consensus on a global picture of LIG temperature changes. Here we present the first model inter-comparison of transient simulations covering the LIG period. By comparing the different simulations, we aim at investigating the common signal in the LIG temperature evolution, investigating the main driving forces behind it and at listing the climate feedbacks which cause the most apparent inter-model differences.    The model inter-comparison shows a robust Northern Hemisphere July temperature evolution characterized by a maximum between 130–125 ka BP with temperatures 0.3 to 5.3 K above present day. A Southern Hemisphere July temperature maximum, −1.3 to 2.5 K at around 128 ka BP, is only found when changes in the greenhouse gas concentrations are included. The robustness of simulated January temperatures is large in the Southern Hemisphere and the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For these regions maximum January temperature anomalies of respectively −1 to 1.2 K and −0.8 to 2.1 K are simulated for the period after 121 ka BP. In both hemispheres these temperature maxima are in line with the maximum in local summer insolation.    In a number of specific regions, a common temperature evolution is not found amongst the models. We show that this is related to feedbacks within the climate system which largely determine the simulated LIG temperature evolution in these regions. Firstly, in the Arctic region, changes in the summer sea-ice cover control the evolution of LIG winter temperatures. Secondly, for the Atlantic region, the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific, possible changes in the characteristics of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are crucial. Thirdly, the presence of remnant continental ice from the preceding glacial has shown to be important when determining the timing of maximum LIG warmth in the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, the results reveal that changes in the monsoon regime exert a strong control on the evolution of LIG temperatures over parts of Africa and India. By listing these inter-model differences, we provide a starting point for future proxy-data studies and the sensitivity experiments needed to constrain the climate simulations and to further enhance our understanding of the temperature evolution of the LIG period	['SDG13']

10.1016/j.renene.2013.08.012	Refinements to the EFDC model for predicting the hydro-environmental impacts of a barrage across the Severn Estuary	This paper presents an investigation of the impacts of a Severn Barrage on the hydro-environment of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model with a recently developed Barrage module (EFDC_B). Details are given of a barrage module being implemented into the EFDC model to represent the various hydraulic structures, such as turbines and sluice gates, as deployed along the barrage line. Several cases, both with and without the barrage, have been simulated to investigate the potential changes on the peak water levels, minimum water depths and peak tidal currents arising from a barrage. The impacts of a barrage on the salinity concentration distribution have also been simulated in both 2D and 3D modes. The predicted results showed that the maximum water levels could be significantly reduced, especially downstream of the barrage and for much of the region in the Severn Estuary and that the minimum water depths would be changed so much that there would be 80.5 km2 loss of intertidal habitats due to the sitting of a barrage across the estuary. Likewise, the peak tidal currents would be considerably reduced, and by as much as a half in the middle of the main channel. The predicted salinity concentrations results indicated that at high water, the salinity concentrations would be reduced by 1–2 ppt downstream and upstream of the barrage and salinity concentrations in the region near Beachley would be reduced by up to 5 ppt, and that at low water, salinity concentrations would be reduced by 0.5–1 ppt in the middle of the Bristol Channel and by typically 0.5 ppt and 1 ppt downstream and upstream of the barrage, respectively. The predicted results also indicated that salinity concentrations downstream and upstream of the barrage would be under a stable state with slight oscillations all the time due to the effects of the barrage. A comparison between the salinity concentration distributions predicted by the 2D and 3D models indicated that the two models produced similar salinity distributions, especially in the Severn Estuary and in the region between the middle of the Bristol Channel and the seaward open boundary	['SDG13']

As this source reaches depletion, the search for alternative and renewable energy options has received much attention on a global scale. The two-pronged approach of renewable energy projects reducing global greenhouse gas emissions through substitution of fossil fuels and prolonging the lifespan of non-renewable energyis deemed as the key to our endeavour for sustainable development. The Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol can act as a tool to provide the financial and technological thrust necessary for effective implementation of renewable energy projects in developing nations. Malaysia, in all its potential, currently utilizes less than 1% of its potential renewable energy capacity despite its recent political and economical advancements in this respect. This paper will assess the untapped potential of renewable energy and status of the CDM in Malaysia, and discuss how the CDM can act as a driver for renewable energy projects in developing nations including Malaysia.</jats:p	['SDG13']

The results show a lower level of emissions under organic production (0.126 kg CO2e per kg of potatoes, compared with 0.145 kg CO2e per kg of conventionally grown potatoes). However, this benefit is cancelled out by higher emissions due to the transportation of organic products over long distances. </jats:p	['SDG13']

10.5194/cp-9-2451-2013	Tree-ring-inferred glacier mass balance variation in southeastern Tibetan Plateau and its linkage with climate variability	A large number of glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have experienced wastage in recent decades. And the wastage is different from region to region, even from glacier to glacier. A better understanding of long-term glacier variations and their linkage with climate variability requires extending the presently observed records. Here we present the first tree-ring-based glacier mass balance (MB) reconstruction in the TP, performed at the Hailuogou Glacier in southeastern TP during 1868–2007. The reconstructed MB is characterized mainly by ablation over the past 140 yr, and typical melting periods occurred in 1910s–1920s, 1930s–1960s, 1970s–1980s, and the last 20 yr. After the 1900s, only a few short periods (i.e., 1920s–1930s, the 1960s and the late 1980s) were characterized by accumulation. These variations can be validated by the terminus retreat velocity of Hailuogou Glacier and the ice-core accumulation rate in Guliya and respond well to regional and Northern Hemisphere temperature anomaly. In addition, the reconstructed MB is significantly and negatively correlated with August–September all-India monsoon rainfall (AIR) (r1871-2008 = &minus;0.342, p < 0.0001). These results suggest that temperature variability is the dominant factor for the long-term MB variation at the Hailuogou Glacier. Indian summer monsoon precipitation does not affect the MB variation, yet the significant negative correlation between the MB and the AIR implies the positive effect of summer heating of the TP on Indian summer monsoon precipitation	['SDG13']

10.1139/cjfr-2013-0196	Growth-climate relationships for six subalpine tree species in a Mediterranean climate	A better understanding of the growth–climate relationship for subalpine trees is key to improving predictions about their future distributions under climate change. In subalpine regions of Mediterranean mountains, drought is an annual event, yet many sites can have long-lasting snowpack. We analyzed the growth–climate relationship from 1896 to 2006 for the six most abundant subalpine tree species (red fir (Abies magnifica A. Murray bis), whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.), Sierra/Cascade lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murrayana (Balf.) Engelm.), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Balf.), western white pine (Pinus monticola Douglas ex D. Don), and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière)) of the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, a region with deep spring snowpack followed by strong summer drought. Chronologies for the six species exhibited a high degree of synchrony in their response to annual fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. For all six species, cool, wet conditions in the year prior to growth are conducive to good radial growth, as well as warm springs with sufficient moisture during the year of growth. For species more common on protected slopes, such as mountain hemlock, deep spring snowpack can limit growth. Although predictions of future precipitation trends in the region are uncertain, drought stress appears to already be increasing. If this trend continues, radial growth is likely to be inhibited for most or all species in our study. Trees growing where snowpack is deep may be least likely to suffer reduced growth. </jats:p	['SDG13']

10.5194/cp-9-2777-2013	The east asian winter monsoon variability in response to precession during the past 150 000 yr	The response of the East Asian winter monsoon variability to orbital forcing is still unclear, and hypotheses are controversial. We present a 150 000 yr record of sea surface temperature difference (ΔSST) between the South China Sea and other Western Pacific Warm Pool regions as a proxy for the intensity of the Asian winter monsoon, because the winter cooling of the South China Sea is caused by the cooling of surface water at the northern margin and the southward advection of cooled water due to winter monsoon winds. The ΔSST showed dominant precession cycles during the past 150 000 yr. The ΔSST varies at precessional band and supports the hypothesis that monsoon is regulated by insolation changes at low-latitudes (Kutzbach, 1981), but contradicts previous suggestions based on marine and loess records that eccentricity controls variability on glacial–interglacial timescales. Maximum winter monsoon intensity corresponds to the May perihelion at precessional band, which is not fully consistent with the Kutzbach model of maximum winter monsoon at the June perihelion. Variation in the East Asian winter monsoon was anti-phased with the Indian summer monsoon, suggesting a linkage of dynamics between these two monsoon systems on an orbital timescale	['SDG13']
10.1021/es403446m	The ozone-climate penalty: Past, present, and future	Climate change is expected to increase global mean temperatures leading to higher tropospheric ozone (O(3)) concentrations in already polluted regions, potentially eroding the benefits of expensive emission controls. The magnitude of the “O(3)-climate penalty” has generally decreased over the past three decades which makes future predictions for climate impacts on air quality uncertain. Researchers attribute historical reductions in the O(3)-climate penalty to reductions in NO(x) emissions, but have so far not extended this theory into a quantitative prediction for future effects. Here we show that a three-dimensional air quality model can be used to map the behavior of the O(3)-climate penalty under varying NO(x) and VOC emissions in both NO(x)-limited and NO(x)-saturated conditions in Central and Southern California, respectively. Simulations suggest that the planned emissions control program for O(3) precursors will not diminish the O(3)-climate penalty to zero as some observational studies might imply. The results further demonstrate that in a NO(x)-limited air basin, NO(x) control strategies alone are sufficient to both decrease the O(3)-climate penalty and mitigate O(3) pollution, while in a NO(x)-saturated air basin, a modified emissions control plan that carefully chooses reductions in both NO(x) and VOC emissions may be necessary to eliminate the O(3)-climate penalty while simultaneously reducing base case O(3) concentrations to desired levels. Additional modeling is needed to determine the behavior of the O(3)-climate penalty as NO(x) and VOC emissions evolve in other regions	['SDG13']

10.1175/jcli-d-13-00260.1	Balanced and coherent climate estimation by combining data with a biased coupled model	Abstract                Given a biased coupled model and the atmospheric and oceanic observing system, maintaining a balanced and coherent climate estimation is of critical importance for producing accurate climate analysis and prediction initialization. However, because of limitations of the observing system (e.g., most of the oceanic measurements are only available for the upper ocean), directly evaluating climate estimation with real observations is difficult. With two coupled models that are biased with respect to each other, a biased twin experiment is designed to simulate the problem. To do that, the atmospheric and oceanic observations drawn from one model based on the modern climate observing system are assimilated into the other. The model that produces observations serves as the truth and the degree by which an assimilation recovers the truth steadily and coherently is an assessment of the impact of the data constraint scheme on climate estimation. Given the assimilation model bias of warmer atmosphere and colder ocean, where the atmospheric-only (oceanic only) data constraint produces an overcooling (overwarming) ocean through the atmosphere–ocean interaction, the constraints with both atmospheric and oceanic data create a balanced and coherent ocean estimate as the observational model. Moreover, the consistent atmosphere–ocean constraint produces the most accurate estimate for North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), whereas NADW is too strong (weak) if the system is only constrained by atmospheric (oceanic) data. These twin experiment results provide insights that consistent data constraints of multiple components are very important when a coupled model is combined with the climate observing system for climate estimation and prediction initialization.</jats:p	['SDG13']

Suitable methods are required to assess emissions and fuel consumption reduction strategies that seek to improve energy efficiency and furthering decarbonization. This study describes the development and application of an improved modeling framework – the HERA (Highway EneRgy Assessment) methodology – that enables to assess the energy and carbon footprint of different highways and traffic flow scenarios and their comparison. HERA incorporates an average speed consumption model adjusted with a correction factor which takes into account the road gradient. It provides a more comprehensive method for estimating the footprint of particular highway segments under specific traffic conditions. It includes the application of the methodology to the Spanish highway network to validate it. Finally, a case study shows the benefits from using this methodology and how to integrate the objective of carbon footprint reductions into highway design, operation and scenario comparison	['SDG13']

10.1175/jcli-d-14-00214.1	Constraining transient climate sensitivity using coupled climate model simulations of volcanic eruptions	Abstract                Coupled climate model simulations of volcanic eruptions and abrupt changes in CO2 concentration are compared in multiple realizations of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, version 2.1 (GFDL CM2.1). The change in global-mean surface temperature (GMST) is analyzed to determine whether a fast component of the climate sensitivity of relevance to the transient climate response (TCR; defined with the 1% yr−1 CO2-increase scenario) can be estimated from shorter-time-scale climate changes. The fast component of the climate sensitivity estimated from the response of the climate model to volcanic forcing is similar to that of the simulations forced by abrupt CO2 changes but is 5%–15% smaller than the TCR. In addition, the partition between the top-of-atmosphere radiative restoring and ocean heat uptake is similar across radiative forcing agents. The possible asymmetry between warming and cooling climate perturbations, which may affect the utility of volcanic eruptions for estimating the TCR, is assessed by comparing simulations of abrupt CO2 doubling to abrupt CO2 halving. There is slightly less (~5%) GMST change in 0.5 × CO2 simulations than in 2 × CO2 simulations on the short (~10 yr) time scales relevant to the fast component of the volcanic signal. However, inferring the TCR from volcanic eruptions is more sensitive to uncertainties from internal climate variability and the estimation procedure.                The response of the GMST to volcanic eruptions is similar in GFDL CM2.1 and GFDL Climate Model, version 3 (CM3), even though the latter has a higher TCR associated with a multidecadal time scale in its response. This is consistent with the expectation that the fast component of the climate sensitivity inferred from volcanic eruptions is a lower bound for the TCR.</jats:p	['SDG13']

To identify the role of 5hmC in gene-environment interactions, we exposed both young (6-week-old) and aged (18-month-old) mice to both an enriched environment and a standard environment. Exposure to EE significantly improves learning and memory in aged mice and reduces 5hmC abundance in mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, we mapped the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC and found that the alteration of 5hmC modification occurred mainly at gene bodies. In particular, genes involved in axon guidance are enriched among the genes with altered 5hmC modification. These results together suggest that environmental enrichment could modulate the dynamics of 5hmC in hippocampus, which could potentially contribute to improved learning and memory in aged animals	['SDG13']

10.1104/pp.15.00110	Responses of arabidopsis and wheat to rising CO<inf>2</inf> depend on nitrogen source and nighttime CO<inf>2</inf> levels	A major contributor to the global carbon cycle is plant respiration. Elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations may either accelerate or decelerate plant respiration for reasons that have been uncertain. We recently established that elevated CO(2) during the daytime decreases plant mitochondrial respiration in the light and protein concentration because CO(2) slows the daytime conversion of nitrate (NO(3)(−)) into protein. This derives in part from the inhibitory effect of CO(2) on photorespiration and the dependence of shoot NO(3)(−) assimilation on photorespiration. Elevated CO(2) also inhibits the translocation of nitrite into the chloroplast, a response that influences shoot NO(3)(−) assimilation during both day and night. Here, we exposed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants to daytime or nighttime elevated CO(2) and supplied them with NO(3)(−) or ammonium as a sole nitrogen (N) source. Six independent measures (plant biomass, shoot NO(3)(−), shoot organic N, (15)N isotope fractionation, (15)NO(3)(−) assimilation, and the ratio of shoot CO(2) evolution to O(2) consumption) indicated that elevated CO(2) at night slowed NO(3)(−) assimilation and thus decreased dark respiration in the plants reliant on NO(3)(−). These results provide a straightforward explanation for the diverse responses of plants to elevated CO(2) at night and suggest that soil N source will have an increasing influence on the capacity of plants to mitigate human greenhouse gas emissions	['SDG13']

10.3402/tellusb.v67.26442	Geographically coherent patterns of albedo enhancement and suppression associated with aerosol sources and sinks	Earth's albedo is the primary determinant of the amount of energy absorbed by the Earth–atmosphere system. It is a function of the fractional cloud cover and the cloudy- and clear-sky albedos, and thereby of the aerosol loading of the atmosphere. Here, we introduce a method by which we can examine the spatial distribution of the albedo variability that is independent of variations in the two dominant factors of albedo: cloud fraction and liquid water path (LWP). The analysis is based on data simultaneously retrieved from the CERES and MODIS instruments carried on board the Aqua satellite. We analysed the daily overpass data between July 2002 and June 2014 and showed that perturbations in albedo, accounting for variations induced by cloud fraction and LWP, display a coherent geographical pattern. Positive deviations occur in proximity to known anthropogenic aerosol sources, and negative deviations coincide with areas of intense precipitation, acting as aerosol sinks. A simple multiplication of the observed positive perturbations in albedo with the solar flux of 340 W m−2 yields a magnitude of that effect of several watts per square meter locally. While the location and scale of the geographical pattern might suggest an anthropogenic contribution to the positive albedo perturbations, it is imperative to first carefully examine all other possible causal factors behind the perturbations. Finally, although we have not attempted a full calculation of detection limits, the analysis is capable of sensing very small changes in average albedo of the order of 0.003 out of a total albedo of the order of 0.3. Hence, the applied method might find utilisation in a variety of situations where there is a need to quantify small perturbations of a dependent variable in noisy global data sets	['SDG13']

10.1007/s00704-015-1606-8	Spatial interpolation of precipitation indexes in Sierra Nevada (Spain): comparing the performance of some interpolation methods	The objective of this paper is to examine the spatial distribution of several precipitation indexes in Sierra Nevada, Spain: mean annual number of wet days (R ≥ 1 mm), mean annual number of heavy rainy days (R ≥ 10 mm) and mean annual number of very heavy precipitation days (R ≥ 20 mm) and test the performance of several interpolation methods using these variables. In total, 17 univariate and multivariate methods were tested. A set of 36 metereological stations distributed in Sierra Nevada and neighbouring areas was analysed in this study. The original data did not followed the normal distribution; thus, a logarithm was applied to data meet normality purposes. Interpolator’s performance was assessed using the root mean square error generated from cross-validation. The results showed that the mean annual R ≥ 10 mm and R ≥ 20 mm have a higher variability than R ≥ 1 mm. While the elevation and longitude did not show a significant correlation with the studied indexes, the latitude (i.e. distance to the sea) showed a significant negative correlation. The regressions carried out confirmed that elevation was the covariate with higher capacity to explain the variability of the indexes. The incorporation of elevation and longitude slightly increased the explanation capacity of the models. The data of LogR ≥ 1 mm, LogR ≥ 10 mm and LogR ≥ 20 mm displayed a clustered pattern, especially the last two indexes that also showed a strong spatial dependency attributed to the effects of local topography, slope, aspect and valley orientation. The best fitted variogram model to LogR ≥ 1 mm was the linear one while for the LogR ≥ 10 mm and LogR ≥ 20 mm, the Gaussian was the most appropriate. The best interpolator for LogR ≥ 1 mm was the local polinomyal with the power of 1, whereas for LogR ≥ 10 mm and LogR ≥ 20 mm, regression kriging (ROK) using as auxiliary variables the elevation, latitude and longitude was the most accurate. ROK methods significantly improved the interpolations accuracy, especially in LogR ≥ 10 mm and LogR ≥ 20 mm. Nevertheless, the covariates, when used as auxiliary information in ordinary kriging, did not improve the precision of the interpolation.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio	['SDG13']
10.1098/rspb.2014.2930	Evaluating the metapopulation consequences of ecological traps	Ecological traps occur when environmental changes cause maladaptive habitat selection. Despite their relevance to metapopulations, ecological traps have been studied predominantly at local scales. How these local impacts scale up to affect the dynamics of spatially structured metapopulations in heterogeneous landscapes remains unexplored. We propose that assessing the metapopulation consequences of traps depends on a variety of factors that can be grouped into four categories: the probability of encounter, the likelihood of selection, the fitness costs of selection and species-specific vulnerability to these costs. We evaluate six hypotheses using a network-based metapopulation model to explore the relative importance of factors across these categories within a spatial context. Our model suggests (i) traps are most severe when they represent a large proportion of habitats, severely reduce fitness and are highly attractive, and (ii) species with high intrinsic fitness will be most susceptible. We provide the first evidence that (iii) traps may be beneficial for metapopulations in rare instances, and (iv) preferences for natal-like habitats can magnify the effects of traps. Our study provides important insight into the effects of traps at landscape scales, and highlights the need to explicitly consider spatial context to better understand and manage traps within metapopulations	['SDG13']

10.3390/rs70911821	Seasonal and inter-annual analysis of chlorophyll-a and inherent optical properties from satellite observations in the inner and mid-shelves of the south of Buenos Aires Province (Argentina)	International audienceThe aim of this study is to describe and understand the seasonal and inter-annual physical and biological dynamics of the inner and mid shelves of the Southwestern Buenos Aires Province (Argentina). We used chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations and inherent optical properties (IOPs), derived from ocean color products between 2002 and 2010, as a proxy for the physical and biological parameters of interest. This study focuses on the absorption by phytoplankton, aph(443), particulate backscattering, bbp(443), and absorption due to dissolved and particulate detrital matter, adg(443), and chl-a derived from a multiband quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA). A regionalization based on the coefficient of variation and the Census X-11 method were applied to define regions and to analyze the inter-annual and seasonal variability of the ocean color parameters, with regards to climate variability. The coastal zone presents the highest values of chl-a with two maxima in winter and autumn, while the mid-shelf shows a strong spring chl-a maximum. After 2009, all parameters under study shifted their seasonality and their magnitude changed over the entire area. In the coastal zone, mean values of aph(443) and bbp(443) increased, while in the mid-shelf, chl-a and aph(443) decreased. The observed inter-annual and seasonal behavior of the parameters is tightly related to climate variability of the study area	['SDG13']

10.1175/jcli-d-15-0040.1	Contrasting short- and long-term projections of the hydrological cycle in the southern extratropics	Abstract                Analysis of model output from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) reveals that, in the zonal mean, the near-term projections of summertime changes of precipitation in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) subtropics are very widely scattered among the models. As a consequence, over the next 50 years, the CMIP5 multimodel mean projects no statistically significant trends in the SH subtropics in summer. This appears to be at odds with the widely reported, and robust, poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones by the end of the twenty-first century.                This discrepancy between the shorter- and longer-term projections in SH summer, as shown here, rests in the recovery of the ozone hole in the coming decades, as a consequence of the Montreal Protocol. This is explicitly demonstrated by analyzing model experiments with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 4 (WACCM4), a high-top model with interactive stratospheric chemistry, and coupled to land, ocean, and sea ice components. Contrasting WACCM4 integrations of the representative concentration pathway 4.5 with and without trends in surface concentrations of ozone-depleting substances allows for demonstrating that stratospheric ozone recovery will largely offset the induced “wet gets wetter and dry gets drier” projections and the accompanying poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone in the SH. The lack of near-term statistically significant zonal-mean changes in the SH hydrological cycle during summer is of obvious practical importance for many parts of the world, and it might also have implications for the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic continent.</jats:p	['SDG13']

Pre-2000 aerial imagery for the Sabie River (catchment area 6320 km2) reveals downstream alternations from alluvial single thread or braided, to bedrock anastomosed or mixed anastomosed channel types, with pool-rapids also present locally. In 2000 and 2012, extreme floods resulted in significant alluvial erosion, widely exposing the underlying bedrock. Since the 2012 flood, aerial LiDAR surveys reveal the strong gradient control exerted by the bedrock and mixed anastomosed channel types, which influences hydraulic conditions and sediment dynamics. Two dimensional hydraulic modelling of moderate floods (3 s&minus;1) reveals reduced velocities upstream of bedrock or mixed anastomosed channel types, which promotes deposition. During more extreme floods (>3500 m3 s&minus;1), the bedrock or mixed anastomosed channel types are drowned out, resulting in dramatically increased velocities along the entire river and widespread alluvial stripping regardless of initial channel type or location	['SDG13']

ABSTRACT                Antarctic notothenioids dominate the fish fauna of the Southern Ocean. Evolution for millions of years at cold and stable temperatures has led to the acquisition of numerous biochemical traits that allow these fishes to thrive in sub-zero waters. The gain of antifreeze glycoproteins has afforded notothenioids the ability to avert freezing and survive at temperatures often hovering near the freezing point of seawater. Additionally, possession of cold-adapted proteins and membranes permits them to sustain appropriate metabolic rates at exceptionally low body temperatures. The notothenioid genome is also distinguished by the disappearance of traits in some species, losses that might prove costly in a warmer environment. Perhaps the best-illustrated example is the lack of expression of hemoglobin in white-blooded icefishes from the family Channichthyidae. Loss of key elements of the cellular stress response, notably the heat shock response, has also been observed. Along with their attainment of cold tolerance, notothenioids have developed an extreme stenothermy and many species perish at temperatures only a few degrees above their habitat temperatures. Thus, in light of today's rapidly changing climate, it is critical to evaluate how these extreme stenotherms will respond to rising ocean temperatures. It is conceivable that the remarkable cold specialization of notothenioids may ultimately leave them vulnerable to future thermal increases and threaten their fitness and survival. Within this context, our review provides a current summary of the biochemical losses and gains that are known for notothenioids and examines these cold-adapted traits with a focus on processes underlying thermal tolerance and acclimation capacity.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.11.038	Estimating the impact of climate change and local operational procedures on the energy use in several supermarkets throughout Great Britain	AbstractPossible changes in gas and electricity consumption in supermarkets throughout Great Britain have been investigated for the 2030s in order to assist decision makers with choices relating to energy use. In addition to this, two operational procedures, which vary between supermarkets, were investigated to see if a link between them and differences in energy consumption could be established. To achieve these aims, seven similar supermarkets were identified and their data analysed to derive their energy signatures through simple and change point regression analysis. These models were then combined with data from climate change prediction project UKCP09 for different probabilities (10%, 50% and 90%) of temperature increase in order to calculate changes in future energy use. In addition it was investigated if a linear regression model between the selected operational procedures and electricity use could be established.The results showed that, compared with the base period 1961–1990, the mean values of the annual average temperature for these seven supermarkets was predicted to rise by 2.0°C or 20% for the central estimate. This led to an estimate of an increase in average electricity consumption of 2% and an average drop in the gas usage of 10%. The result also showed that differences in operational practices seem to have little impact on the in-store energy use. Differences in gas use models between stores can be more credibly explained by the building volume	['SDG13']

10.1590/1519-6984.00614bm	Abundance of Harpy and crested eagles from a reservoir-impact area in the low- and mid-Xingu River	Abstract In the Brazilian Amazon, two monospecific genera, the Harpy Eagle and Crested Eagle have low densities and are classified by IUCN as Near Threatened due to habitat loss, deforestation, habitat degradation and hunting. In this study, we evaluate occurrence of these large raptors using the environmental surveys database from Belo Monte Hydroelectric Power Plant. Integrating the dataset from two methods, we plotted a distribution map along the Xingu River, including records over a 276-km stretch of river. Terrestrial surveys (RAPELD method) were more efficient for detecting large raptors than standardized aquatic surveys, although the latter were complementary in areas without modules. About 53% of the records were obtained during activities of wildlife rescue/flushing, vegetation suppression or in transit. Between 2012 and 2014, four Harpy Eagles were removed from the wild; two shooting victims, one injured by collision with power lines and one hit by a vehicle. Also, seven nests were mapped. The mean distance between Harpy Eagle records was 15 km along the river channel, with a mean of 20 km between nests near the channel, which allowed us to estimate 20 possible pairs using the alluvial forest, riverine forest and forest fragments. Territories of another ten pairs will probably be affected by inundation of the Volta Grande channel, which is far from the main river. The average distance between Crested Eagle records was 16 km along the river channel. The only nest found was 1.3 km away from a Harpy Eagle nest. The remnant forests are under threat of being replaced by cattle pastures, so we recommend that permanently protected riparian vegetation borders (APP) be guaranteed, and that forest fragments within 5 km of the river be conserved to maintain eagle populations.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.1007/s11367-015-0991-7	Mineral resources in life cycle impact assessment—defining the path forward	Purpose: Despite 20 years of research, there remains no robust, globally agreed upon method—or even problem statement—for assessing mineral resource inputs in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). As a result, inclusion of commonly used methods such as abiotic depletion potential (ADP) in life cycle assessment (LCA)-related evaluation schemes could lead to incorrect decisions being made in many applications. In this paper, we explore in detail how to improve the way that life cycle thinking is applied to the acquisition of mineral resources and their metal counterparts. Methods: This paper evaluates the current body of work in LCIA with regard to “depletion potential” of mineral resources. Viewpoints from which models are developed are described and analyzed. The assumptions, data sources, and calculations that underlie currently used methods are examined. A generic metal-containing product is analyzed to demonstrate the vulnerability of results to the denominator utilized in calculating ADP. The adherence to the concept of the area of protection (AOP) is evaluated for current models. The use of ore grades, prices, and economic availability in LCIA is reviewed. Results and discussion: Results demonstrate that any work on resource depletion in a life cycle context needs to have a very clear objective or LCIA will not accurately characterize mineral resource use from any perspective and decision-making will continue to suffer. New, harmonized terminology is proposed so that LCA practitioners can build better mutual understanding with the mineral industry and recommendations regarding more promising tools for use in life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) are given. Conclusions: The economic issue of resource availability should be evaluated in parallel with traditional LCA, not within. LCIA developers should look to economists, the market, and society in general, for broader assessments that consider shorter-time horizons than the traditional LCIA methods. To do so, the concept of the AOP in LCA needs to be redefined for LCSA to ensure that models estimate what is intended. Finally, recommendations regarding mineral resource assessment are provided to ensure that future research has a sound basis and practitioners can incorporate the appropriate tools in their work.</p	['SDG13']

Three interrelated questions motivate our analysis. First, how does the environmental risk perception of air pollution, water pollution, agricultural chemicals, climate change and nuclear power generation vary among specific categories of race and ethnicity? Second, to what degree are higher levels of perceived risk among immigrant-origin groups subject to change as a result of cultural assimilation over generations? And third, to what degree are race and ethnic differences in environmental risk perception a reflection of other possibly more significant factors such as education, income, gender and conservative political views? Though we find some evidence for attitude assimilation among generations of Mexican-origin people, the dominant pattern is greater perceived risks among non-whites than whites across generations in the U.S. Additionally, not only did race and ethnic groups show greater concern for the threats posed by climate change and nuclear power generation than whites, they also expressed more concern about these two topics than they did for more localized issues such as air pollution emanating from industry and transportation. Despite our statistical controls for socioeconomic status, race and ethnic categories remained strong independent predictors of perceived environmental threats. </jats:p	['SDG13']

10.5194/gmd-9-283-2016	The GEWEX LandFlux project: Evaluation of model evaporation using tower-based and globally gridded forcing data	Abstract. Determining the spatial distribution and temporal development of evaporation at regional and global scales is required to improve our understanding of the coupled water and energy cycles and to better monitor any changes in observed trends and variability of linked hydrological processes. With recent international efforts guiding the development of long-term and globally distributed flux estimates, continued product assessments are required to inform upon the selection of suitable model structures and also to establish the appropriateness of these multi-model simulations for global application. In support of the objectives of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Exchanges (GEWEX) LandFlux project, four commonly used evaporation models are evaluated against data from tower-based eddy-covariance observations, distributed across a range of biomes and climate zones. The selected schemes include the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) approach, the Priestley–Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model, the Penman–Monteith-based Mu model (PM-Mu) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Here we seek to examine the fidelity of global evaporation simulations by examining the multi-model response to varying sources of forcing data. To do this, we perform parallel and collocated model simulations using tower-based data together with a global-scale grid-based forcing product. Through quantifying the multi-model response to high-quality tower data, a better understanding of the subsequent model response to the coarse-scale globally gridded data that underlies the LandFlux product can be obtained, while also providing a relative evaluation and assessment of model performance.  Using surface flux observations from 45 globally distributed eddy-covariance stations as independent metrics of performance, the tower-based analysis indicated that PT-JPL provided the highest overall statistical performance (0.72; 61 W m−2; 0.65), followed closely by GLEAM (0.68; 64 W m−2; 0.62), with values in parentheses representing the R2, RMSD and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), respectively. PM-Mu (0.51; 78 W m−2; 0.45) tended to underestimate fluxes, while SEBS (0.72; 101 W m−2; 0.24) overestimated values relative to observations. A focused analysis across specific biome types and climate zones showed considerable variability in the performance of all models, with no single model consistently able to outperform any other. Results also indicated that the global gridded data tended to reduce the performance for all of the studied models when compared to the tower data, likely a response to scale mismatch and issues related to forcing quality. Rather than relying on any single model simulation, the spatial and temporal variability at both the tower- and grid-scale highlighted the potential benefits of developing an ensemble or blended evaporation product for global-scale LandFlux applications. Challenges related to the robust assessment of the LandFlux product are also discussed.                     </jats:p	['SDG13']

10.1007/s10530-015-1025-x	Non-native and native organisms moving into high elevation and high latitude ecosystems in an era of climate change: new challenges for ecology and conservation	International audienceCold environments at high elevation and high latitude are often viewed as resistant to biological invasions. However, climate warming, land use change and associated increased connectivity all increase the risk of biological invasions in these environments. Here we present a summary of the key discussions of the workshop ‘Biosecurity in Mountains and Northern Ecosystems: Current Status and Future Challenges’ (Flen, Sweden, 1–3 June 2015). The aims of the workshop were to (1) increase awareness about the growing importance of species expansion—both non-native and native—at high elevation and high latitude with climate change, (2) review existing knowledge about invasion risks in these areas, and (3) encourage more research on how species will move and interact in cold environments, the consequences for biodiversity, and animal and human health and wellbeing. The diversity of potential and actual invaders reported at the workshop and the likely interactions between them create major challenges for managers of cold environments. However, since these cold environments have experienced fewer invasions when compared with many warmer, more populated environments, prevention has a real chance of success, especially if it is coupled with prioritisation schemes for targeting invaders likely to have greatest impact. Communication and co-operation between cold environment regions will facilitate rapid response, and maximise the use of limited research and management resources	['SDG13']

10.1007/s00227-016-2844-8	Temperate predators and seasonal water temperatures impact feeding of a range expanding tropical fish	© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Range expansions of species due to climate change threaten the function and composition of marine ecosystems globally, yet factors constraining or facilitating this redistribution are poorly understood. Native predators may constrain prey shifting poleward through consumption, or by restricting their feeding activity. However, the extent that native predators impact range-expanders will likely be structured by physiological mismatches between these groups, associated with water temperatures. We examined how temperate predators and seasonal water temperature affected foraging of the planktivorous tropical reef fish, Abudefduf vaigiensis, within temperate southeastern Australian waters, an emerging new range. Foraging excursions of A. vaigiensis were compared between predator-rich marine reserves and predator-depauperate fished reefs during summer and winter (~18 and 22 °C water, respectively). A. vaigiensis foraged with shorter excursions in marine reserves than fished reefs and higher excursions during summer than winter. Effects of predation risk and water temperature on A. vaigiensis foraging were isolated in an aquarium experiment. Groups were held at 18 or 22 °C and visually exposed to a temperate predator, a predator control (temperate herbivore) and an empty tank. Foraging excursions and feeding rates were reduced when exposed to predators at 22 °C, but did not differ between predator and the predator control or empty tank at 18 °C. Results suggest temperate predators may restrict range expansions of A. vaigiensis by reducing its’ food intake during summer months. But winter water temperatures may limit feeding, independent of predation risk. Protection of predators from fishing should improve resistance of some marine ecosystems to impacts of range expanding prey	['SDG13']

10.1175/ei-d-15-0032.1	Narrowing the agronomic yield gaps of maize by improved soil, cultivar, and agricultural management practices in different climate zones of Northeast China	Abstract                Northeast China (NEC) is one of the major agricultural production areas in China, producing about 30% of China’s total maize output. In the past five decades, maize yields in NEC increased rapidly. However, farmer yields still have potential to be increased. Therefore, it is important to quantify the impacts of agronomic factors, including soil physical properties, cultivar selections, and management practices on yield gaps of maize under the changing climate in NEC in order to provide reliable recommendations to narrow down the yield gaps. In this study, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Maize model was used to separate the contributions of soil physical properties, cultivar selections, and management practices to maize yield gaps. The results indicate that approximately 5%, 12%, and 18% of potential yield loss of maize is attributable to soil physical properties, cultivar selection, and management practices. Simulation analyses showed that potential ascensions of yield of maize by improving soil physical properties PAYs, changing to cultivar with longer maturity PAYc, and improving management practices PAYm for the entire region were 0.6, 1.5, and 2.2 ton ha−1 or 9%, 23%, and 34% increases, respectively, in NEC. In addition, PAYc and PAYm varied considerably from location to location (0.4 to 2.2 and 0.9 to 4.5 ton ha−1 respectively), which may be associated with the spatial variation of growing season temperature and precipitation among climate zones in NEC. Therefore, changing to cultivars with longer growing season requirement and improving management practices are the top strategies for improving yield of maize in NEC, especially for the north and west areas.</jats:p	['SDG13']

Integrated assessments can identify and quantify vulnerability in order to recognize these adaptation needs. This study presents a geographic visualization approach to support the interactive assessment of agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We have identified requirements for increased transparency and reflexivity in vulnerability assessments, arguing that these can be met by geographic visualization. A conceptual framework to support the integration of geographic visualization for vulnerability assessments has been designed and applied for the development of AgroExplore, an interactive tool for assessing agricultural vulnerability to climate change in Sweden. To open up the black box of composite vulnerability indices, AgroExplore enables the user to select, weight, and classify relevant indicators into sub-indices of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. This enables the exploration of underlying indicators and factors determining vulnerability in Nordic agriculture.</p	['SDG13']

10.3389/fenvs.2014.00003	The impact of climate change on heat-related mortality in six major cities, South Korea, under representative concentration pathways (RCPs)	Background: We aimed to quantify the excess mortality associated with increased temperature due to climate change in six major Korean cities under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) which are new emission scenarios designed for the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Methods: We first examined the association between daily mean temperature and mortality in each during the summertime (June to September) from 2001 to 2008. This was done using a generalized linear Poisson model with adjustment for a long-term time trend, relative humidity, air pollutants, and day of the week. We then computed heat-related mortality attributable to future climate change using estimated mortality risks, projected future populations, and temperature increments for both future years 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5. We considered effects from added days with high temperatures over thresholds and shifted effects from high to higher temperature.Results: Estimated excess all-cause mortalities for six cities in Korea ranged from 500 (95% CI: 313-703) for 2041-2070 to 2,320 (95% CI: 1,430-3,281) deaths per year for 2071-2100 under two RCPs. Excess cardiovascular mortality was estimated to range from 192 (95% CI: 41-351) to 896 (95% CI: 185-1,694) deaths per year, covering about 38.5% of all-cause excess mortality. Increased rates of heat-related mortality were higher in cities located at relatively lower latitude than cities with higher latitude. Estimated excess mortality under RCP 8.5, a fossil fuel-intensive emission scenario, was more than twice as high compared with RCP 4.5, low to medium emission scenario.Conclusions: Excess mortality due to climate change is expected to be profound in the future showing spatial variation. Efforts to mitigate climate change can cause substantial health benefits via reducing heat-related mortality	['SDG13']

10.1175/jcli-d-15-0048.1	A climatology of multiple tropical cyclone events	Abstract                The present study provides a climatology of multiple tropical cyclone (TC) events (MTCEs) and the potential environmental factors responsible for triggering MTCEs in the North Atlantic (NATL), eastern North Pacific (EPAC), and western North Pacific (WPAC). While single TC events (STCEs) occur more frequently than MTCEs in each basin, a substantial fraction (34%–57%) of all TCs within each basin occur during MTCEs. Comparison of the total monthly number of MTCEs and STCEs reveals significant correlations (0.79 ≤ R ≤ 0.90), while nonsignificant correlations exist between the annual number of MTCEs and STCEs. New TCs that form during MTCEs occur in the eastern main development region east of the STCE formation location in the NATL and EPAC, while new TC formation locations are spread evenly throughout the WPAC during both MTCEs and STCEs. The spatiotemporal separation between TCs during MTCEs is consistent among basins with median zonal distances between TCs of ~(1640–2010) km and median temporal separation between TC formation of 3.00–3.25 days. Composites of EPAC MTCEs suggest the existence of significantly stronger large-scale intraseasonal anomalies compared to STCEs, which may favor EPAC MTCE occurrence. Eastward zonal group velocities and the agreement of the zonal wavelength of TC-induced Rossby waves with the observed zonal distance between TCs suggests that Rossby wave radiation may contribute to a substantial fraction of MTCEs in all basins. These results suggest remarkable similarity in MTCE characteristics among basins, while potentially indicating that the large-scale environment is preconditioned for EPAC MTCE occurrence.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.1071/an14771	A promising and simple method to quantify soil/manure mixing on beef feedlot pens	On beef cattle feed pen surfaces, fresh and decayed manure is mixed with base rock or soil (base). Quantifying this mixing has beneficial applications for aspects including nutrient and greenhouse gas budgeting. However, no practical methods exist to quantify mixing. We investigated if measuring element concentrations in: (A) fresh manure, (B) base material, and (C) pen manure offers a promising method to quantify manure/base mixing on pen surfaces. Using three operational beef feedlots as study sites, we targeted carbon (C), and silicon (Si), which are the two most abundant and easily measurable organic and inorganic elements. Our results revealed that C concentrations were strongly (&gt;15 times) and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher whereas Si concentrations strongly (&gt;10 times) and significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower in fresh manure than base material at all three sites. These relative concentrations were not significantly impacted by manure decay, as determined by an 18-week incubation experiment. This suggested that both of these elements are suitable markers for quantifying base/manure mixing on pens. However, due to the chemical change of manure during decay, C was shown to be an imprecise marker of base/manure mixing. By contrast, using Si to estimate base/manure mixing was largely unaffected by manure decay. These findings were confirmed by measuring C and Si concentrations in stockpiled pen surface manure from one of the sites. Using Si concentrations is a promising approach to quantify base/manure mixing on feed pens given that this element is abundantly concentrated in soils and rocks. </jats:p	['SDG13']

Here, ENSO is defined as the leading mode of seasonally varying canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between anomalies of tropical Pacific SST and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The CCA reveals that the strongest regions of coupling are mostly invariant as a function of season and correspond to an OLR region located in the central Pacific Ocean (CP-OLR) and an SST region in the eastern Pacific that coincides with the Niño-3 region. In a linear context, the authors explore whether the use of a combined index of these SST and OLR regions explains additional variance of North American temperature and precipitation anomalies beyond that described by using a single index alone. Certain seasons and regions benefit from the use of a combined index. In particular, a combined index describes more variability in winter/spring precipitation and summer temperature.</jats:p	['SDG13']

A field warming experiment was conducted in an alpine meadow at a low (4313 m), mid- (4513 m) and high elevation (4693 m) in the Northern Tibet since May 2010. Growing season vapor pressure deficit (VPD), soil temperature (Ts) and air temperature (Ta) decreased with increasing elevation, while growing season precipitation, soil moisture (SM), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), AGB and GPP increased with increasing elevation. The growing season Ta, Ts and VPD in 2015 was greater than that in 2014, while the growing season precipitation, SM, NDVI, SAVI, AGB and GPP in 2015 was lower than that in 2014, respectively. Compared to the mean air temperature and precipitation during the growing season in 1963-2015, it was a warmer and wetter year in 2014 and a warmer and drier year in 2015. Experimental warming increased growing season Ts, Ta,VPD, but decreased growing season SM in 2014-2015 at all the three elevations. Experimental warming only reduced growing season NDVI, SAVI, AGB and GPP at the low elevation in 2015. Growing season NDVI, SAVI, AGB and GPP increased with increasing SM and precipitation, but decreased with increasing VPD, indicating vegetation index and biomass production increased with environmental humidity. The VPD explained more variation of growing season NDVI, SAVI, AGB and GPP compared to Ts, Ta and SM at all the three elevations. Therefore, environmental humidity regulated the effect of experimental warming on vegetation index and biomass production in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau	['SDG13']

10.1016/j.cliser.2016.11.004	Identifying research priorities to advance climate services	Climate services involve the timely production, translation, and delivery of useful climate data, information, and knowledge for societal decision-making. They rely on a range of expertise and are underpinned by research in climate and related sciences, sectoral applications (e.g., agriculture, water, health, energy, disasters), and a number of social science fields, including political science, sociology, anthropology, and economics. Feedback and engagement between these research communities and the communities involved in developing and/or using climate services is thus critical, ensuring that climate services are built on the best available science and providing researchers with guidance regarding priority challenges in the development of climate services that should warrant their attention. This paper reports the results of an international survey to gauge community perspective on research priorities for climate services, highlighting several areas in which respondents agree on the need for future work. The survey results indicate an overarching interest in research that can better connect climate information to users, particularly around the communication of climate information, the mapping of climate information needs, and the evaluation and prioritization of capacity building efforts. They also reveal significant interest in climate research to advance the skill of forecasts at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales – considered more broadly useful to decision makers than information at the end-of-century timescale – and to identify the drivers of extreme events. To support climate-related research, survey respondents underscore the need to continually develop and maintain the observational network. In analyzing these results, the paper offers guidance to researchers and to other members of the climate services community that may find these priorities useful in directing their own work to address the challenges posed by climate variability and change	['SDG13']

We present a dataset of flowering and maturity dates, recorded each year for one tree when available, or the average of several trees for each cultivar, over a period of 37 years (1978-2015). Such a dataset is extremely valuable for characterizing the phenological response to climate change, and the plasticity of the different cultivars' behaviour under different environmental conditions. In addition, this dataset will support the development of predictive models for sweet cherry phenology exploitable at the continental scale, and will help anticipate breeding strategies in order to maintain and improve sweet cherry production in Europe	['SDG13']

AbstractBorder tax adjustments in the form of carbon taxes on products from countries with lax environmental production standards or in the form of a required participation in an emissions allowances' trading system have become a heavily debated issue under WTO law. Such an adjustment might be permissible if energy taxes as indirect taxes are applied on inputs during the production process. Compliance with the Most Favoured Nation principle has less practical importance than the not-yet settled likeness discussion under the National Treatment principle. Consequently, since the compatibility of carbon-related border tax adjustment measures is partly contested, potential justifications such as the conservation of exhaustible national resources or the protection of health (Art. XX GATT) become relevant. The application of the necessity and proportionality test requires that carbon measures are tailored so as to substantially contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives and do not create any arbitrary or unjustified discrimination.</jats:p	['SDG13']

The synoptic-scale environmental features of this event were examined based on Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) mesoscale model (MSM) datasets. A synoptic-scale dry environment was formed under the melting layer ahead of the surface warm front by an intense secondary circulation. Back-trajectory analysis suggested that dry air was located to the south of the precipitating area and was conveyed to the precipitating area by strong geostrophic winds. The surface air at Sapporo, Japan, originated from the ocean surface to the southeast and was cooled to almost the same temperature as that of the sea surface (+3°C); that is, the minimum temperature at 600 m progressively decreased to −3°C at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, during the ice pellet event. Sapporo and its surrounding areas, which were at the southern edge of the precipitating area until the passage of the low pressure center and continued to experience midlevel dry and low-level cold inflows maintained by persistent synoptic-scale structures, were identified as the favorable locations for long-lasting ice pellets. </jats:p	['SDG13']
10.1007/978-3-319-54229-4_3	Electricity trading agent for EV-enabled parking lots	The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is seen as an important step towards environmental sustainability. Perhaps not surprising, many governments all around the world are providing incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles (EVs). A positive response from consumers means that the demand for the charging infrastructure increases as well. We investigate how an existing traditional parking lot, upgraded with chargers, can suit the present demand for charging stations. In particular, a resulting EV-enabled parking lot is an electricity trading agent (i.e., broker) which acts as an energy retailer and as a player on a target electricity market. In this paper, we use agent-based simulation to present the EV-enabled parking lot ecosystem in order to model the underlying dynamics and uncertainties regarding parking lots with electricity trading agent functionalities. We instantiate our agentbased simulations using real-life data in order to perform the what-if analysis. Several key performance indicators (KPIs), including parking utilization, charging utilization and electricity utilization, are proposed. We also illustrate how those KPIs can be used to choose the effective investment strategy with respect to the number and speed of chargers.</p	['SDG13']

Automakers and policy makers need to investigate the lifecycle emissions of EVs in different regions and then governments should decide if it is safe to establish EV production facilities in their country or whether it is more appropriate to import finished products. The objective of this study is to evaluate the air pollutant emissions produced by EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) during their life cycles under two technology scenarios. Life cycle analysis (LCA) was applied to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) and non-GHG emissions. We assessed air pollution from vehicles in Japan, China, and the United Kingdom (UK). Results indicate that EVs do not necessarily decrease pollutant emissions. EVs can improve air quality and reduce emissions in countries where electricity is derived from clean energy resources.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.2166/nh.2017.199	Impact of calculation method, sampling frequency and Hysteresis on suspended solids and total phosphorus load estimations in cold climate	Abstract                Load calculations of nutrients and suspended solids (SS) transported by rivers are usually based on discrete water samples. Water quality changes in cold climate regions often occur very rapidly and therefore discrete samples are unrepresentative of the range of water quality occurring. This leads to errors of varying magnitude in load calculation. High-resolution turbidity data were used to determine the SS and total phosphorus (TP), and paired with discharge to determine loads from two small catchments in southern Finland. The effect of sampling frequency was investigated by artificially sub-sampling the high frequency concentrations. Regardless of the sampling frequency, the TP load was more likely underestimated while using discrete samples. To achieve ±20% accuracy compared with the reference load, daily sampling should be performed. Hysteresis was detected to have an impact on TP load. Hysteresis analysis also revealed the main source of the TP to be in the fields of the catchment. Continuous measuring proved to be a valuable method for defining loads and short-term fluctuations in water quality in small clayey watercourses in a boreal cold climate, where the climate change will increase the frequency of winter floods.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.1111/ddi.12609	Temporal resolutions in species distribution models of highly mobile marine animals: Recommendations for ecologists and managers	While ecologists have long recognized the influence of spatial resolution on species distribution models (SDMs), they have given relatively little attention to the influence of temporal resolution. Considering temporal resolutions is critical in distribution modelling of highly mobile marine animals, as they interact with dynamic oceanographic processes that vary at time-scales from seconds to decades. We guide ecologists in selecting temporal resolutions that best match ecological questions and ecosystems, and managers in applying these models. We group the temporal resolutions of environmental variables used in SDMs into three classes: instantaneous, contemporaneous and climatological. We posit that animal associations with fine-scale and ephemeral features are best modelled with instantaneous covariates. Associations with large scale and persistent oceanographic features are best modelled with climatological covariates. Associations with mesoscale features are best modelled with instantaneous or contemporaneous covariates if ephemeral processes are present or interannual variability occurs, and climatological covariates if seasonal processes dominate and interannual variability is weak	['SDG13']

The results showed that NDVI presented significant increase (0.0046/a) for all of China and all the regions over the last 16 years. Meanwhile, annual mean temperature of China presented a slightly increasing trend, while the annual precipitation showed a slightly decreasing trend over the last 16 years. Nevertheless, there were differences between temperature and precipitation in the subregions of China. The Annual NDVI had better relationships with precipitation (r=0.126) compared to temperature (r=-0.094), and NDVI also had a good correlation with precipitation rather than temperature in different subregions of China. Additionally, human activities also made a difference to the trends of NDVI in some regions. This study is conductive to the effects of climate change on vegetation activity in future research.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.1175/jamc-d-17-0217.1	A spatial and temporal analysis of 30-day heavy snowfall amounts in the eastern United States, 1900-2016	AbstractHeavy 30-day snowfall amounts were evaluated to identify spatial and temporal characteristics east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States during the period 1900–2016. An extensive data assessment identified 507 stations for use in this long-term climate study. The top 30-day heavy snowfall amount and the average of the top five 30-day heavy snowfall amounts were examined. Both amounts generally increased with latitude; however, much higher amounts were found downwind of the Great Lakes, at higher elevations, or in locations impacted by topographic features (e.g., Rockies, Black Hills, and Appalachians). When compared with the 1981–2010 average winter snowfall, the top 30-day amount was found to be greater than the winter average in most areas of the eastern United States. The number of stations experiencing a top-five 30-day heavy snowfall period in a winter ranged from 1 to 128 (1959/60), with a greater overall occurrence in the second half of the 117-yr period. Six episodes had 10% or more stations experiencing one of the top five 30-day snowfall amounts, with the February–March 1960 episode impacting 124 stations, and these episodes were associated with large negative 500-hPa height anomalies. The northern Great Plains, Great Lakes, Midwest, and Northeast experienced more top-five periods in the second half of the 117-yr period, whereas most of the southern states experienced top-five periods throughout the study’s time frame. Examining extremes at periods beyond the daily event and less than the season contributes to our knowledge of climate and provides useful information to snow-sensitive sectors.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.3390/en11051203	Impacts of decarbonisation on the water-energy-land (WEL) nexus: A case study of the Spanish electricity sector	Over the last decades, combating climate change has been an important concern for policy makers. As a result, many policies have been designed towards this direction. Being electricity generation the focus of climate change mitigation policies, important changes are expected in this sector over the next few years as a result of the implementation of such policies. However, electricity production also generates other impacts on the water, energy and land (WEL) nexus that must be further investigated. To shed some light to this issue, this paper presents and discusses the potential impacts on the water-energy-land nexus resulting from the decarbonisation of the Spanish electricity system impacts under two different long-term scenarios. Using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, a set of environmental impacts relevant for the nexus have been analysed for the current and future electricity generation technologies in Spain. Additionally, through the use of an optimization energy model&mdash;Times-Spain&mdash;the evolution of the electricity technologies in Spain until 2030, under two different scenarios and targets has been assessed. Taking into consideration such scenarios, the global warming, acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, water consumption, resource depletion and land use impacts have been estimated. Results show that, over time, together with the decrease of greenhouse gas emission, acidification and eutrophication tend to decrease in both scenarios. On the contrary, ecotoxicity and resource use impacts tend to increase	['SDG13']

10.1093/femsle/fny085	Climate change and One Health	The journal The Lancet recently published a countdown on health and climate change. Attention was focused solely on humans. However, animals, including wildlife, livestock and pets, may also be impacted by climate change. Complementary to the high relevance of awareness rising for protecting humans against climate change, here we present a One Health approach, which aims at the simultaneous protection of humans, animals and the environment from climate change impacts (climate change adaptation). We postulate that integrated approaches save human and animal lives and reduce costs when compared to public and animal health sectors working separately. A One Health approach to climate change adaptation may significantly contribute to food security with emphasis on animal source foods, extensive livestock systems, particularly ruminant livestock, environmental sanitation, and steps towards regional and global integrated syndromic surveillance and response systems. The cost of outbreaks of emerging vector-borne zoonotic pathogens may be much lower if they are detected early in the vector or in livestock rather than later in humans. Therefore, integrated community-based surveillance of zoonoses is a promising avenue to reduce health effects of climate change.ISSN:0378-1097ISSN:1574-6968ISSN:0168-6496ISSN:0920-8534ISSN:0168-644	['SDG13']

10.4314/jae.v22i2.15	Perceived effect of climate change on forest dependent livelihoods in Oyo State, Nigeria	The study investigated the perceived effect of climate change on forest dependent rural livelihoods in Oyo State, Nigeria with the view of identifying possible adaptation strategies. A total of 208 respondents were randomly sampled from Olokemeji and  Onigambari forest reserves in Oluyole and Ibarapa East Local Government Area (LGA), respectively. Data collected were analyzed using frequency distribution, percentages Chi square and PPMC. Result shows that major livelihood activities were farming (100.0%) and trading of forest products (92.8%). Respondents were vulnerable to climate change effects with respect to  undefined season (90.4%), shortage of food production (84.1%), reduction in crop yield (80.8%), pest and disease outbreak (77.9%) which affects their livelihood activities. Major adaptation strategies utilized were soil protection through tree planting (88.5%), planting of different varieties of NTFPs and TFPs (87.0%), practicing shifting cultivation (81.8%) and use of organic fertilizer (81.7%). Respondents’ use of weather insurance was sparing in the study area. Significant relationship existed between farm size (r=-0.257; p≤0.01), monthly income (r=-0.319; p≤0.01) and perceived effect of climate change. Adaptation strategies (r=0.309; p≤0.05) used was significantly related with perceived effect of climate change. Afforestation should be encouraged among forest dependent farmers in addition to adaptation  strategies utilised against climate change. The study recommends the need to educate farmers on the importance and benefit of weather insurance against financial loss due to climate change effects.Keywords: Climate change, livelihood activities, forest product	['SDG13']

10.1002/9781119276050	Microbes for Climate Resilient Agriculture	International audienceSoutheast Asia is well‐known for its species‐rich tropical rainforest, representing a “hotspot” of biodiversity. However, for the past several decades, the biodiversity of this region has been under severe threat due to rapid land use changes, including clearance of forests for agriculture. Soil microorganisms not only make up a large proportion of the biological diversity of the rainforest environment, but also are a fundamental component of nutrient cycling and productivity. The patterns of community composition and diversity of soil microorganisms are somewhat different from those observed in macro‐organisms in the tropics. Soil microbial community structure and diversity seem to be more strongly influenced by edaphic factors rather than by habitat types, with microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) appearing to have clearly defined environmental niches. However, the effects of the land use changes on soil microorganisms are still poorly understood in tropical regions, and in this book chapter, we discuss the effects that land use changes have on composition and diversity of microorganisms in soils of Southeast Asia	['SDG13']

10.1002/rse2.83	The importance of lakes for bat conservation in Amazonian rainforests: an assessment using autonomous recorders	Recent studies predict a future decrease in precipitation across the tropics, particularly the Amazon, likely causing significant droughts that have negative consequences for Amazonian freshwater biomes, especially lakes. Furthermore,  immediate consequences of global warming for terrestrial fauna associated with  tropical lakes are poorly understood as the vast majority of studies come from  temperate regions. Here, we assess the seasonal importance of lakes for the conservation of aerial insectivorous bats in the Central Amazon using passive bat  recorders. We compared richness, general bat activity and foraging activity  between lakes and adjacent forest. Of a total of 21 species/sonotypes recorded  in both habitats, all were detected over lakes, and 18 were significantly more  active over lakes than in forest. Only two species had significantly higher activity levels in the forest than at the lakes. Species richness and general bat activity  over the lakes were higher in the dry than in the rainy season. Foraging activity  was also greater over the lakes than within the forest in both seasons. Moreover, both variables were positively correlated with lake size, although the effect  on activity was species-specific. Climate change-driven shrinking of lakes may  have detrimental consequences for aerial insectivorous bats, especially for the  most water-dependent species. Compared to permanent water bodies of other  regions, the value of tropical lakes for functionally important taxa, such as bats,  has been understudied. Higher bat activity levels over lakes than in forest in  both seasons and comprising the whole ensemble of aerial insectivorous bats of  the study region, indicate that lakes embedded in Amazonian terra firme forests  deserve special attention for future bat conservation.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio	['SDG13']
10.3390/ijerph15102209	The epidemiological influence of climatic factors on shigellosis incidence rates in Korea	Research has shown the effects of climatic factors on shigellosis; however, no previous study has evaluated climatic effects in regions with a winter seasonality of shigellosis incidence. We examined the effects of temperature and precipitation on shigellosis incidence in Korea from 2002&ndash;2010. The incidence of shigellosis was calculated based on data from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC, Cheongju, Korea), and a generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the associations between the incidence and climatic factors. The annual incidence rate of shigellosis was 7.9 cases/million persons from 2002&ndash;2010. During 2007&ndash;2010, high incidence rates and winter seasonality were observed among those aged &ge;65 years, but not among lower age groups. Based on the GAM model, the incidence of shigellosis is expected to increase by 13.6% and 2.9% with a temperature increase of 1 &deg;C and a lag of two weeks and with a mean precipitation increase of 1 mm and a lag of five weeks after adjustment for seasonality, respectively. This study suggests that the incidence of shigellosis will increase with global climate change despite the winter seasonality of shigellosis in Korea. Public health action is needed to prevent the increase of shigellosis incidence associated with climate variations	['SDG13']

10.3390/app8112083	Evaluation of eco-efficiency of two alternative agricultural biogas plants	Implementation of the circular economy is one of the priorities of the European Union, and energy efficiency is one of its pillars. This article discusses an effective use of agri-food industry waste for the purposes of waste-to-energy in biogas plants. Its basic objective is the comparative assessment of the eco-efficiency of biogas production depending on the type of feedstock used, its transport and possibility to use generated heat. The environmental impact of the analysed installations was assessed with the application of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Cost calculation was performed using the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) method. The LCA analysis indicated that a biogas plant with a lower level of waste heat use where substrates were delivered by wheeled transport has a negative impact on the environment. The structure of distributed energy production cost indicates a substantial share of feedstock supply costs in the total value of the LCOE ratio. Thus, the factor affecting the achievement of high eco-efficiency is the location of a biogas plant in the vicinity of an agri-food processing plant, from which the basic feedstock for biogas production is supplied with the transmission pipeline, whereas heat is transferred for the needs of production processes in a processing plant or farm.</jats:p	['SDG13']

10.3390/su10124604	Spatial-temporal changes of soil respiration across China and the response to land cover and climate change	Soil respiration (Rs) plays an important role in the carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems. Quantifying the spatial and temporal variations in Rs in China at the regional scale helps improve our understanding of the variations in terrestrial carbon budgets that occur in response to global climate and environmental changes and potential future control measures. In this study, we used a regional-scale geostatistical model that incorporates gridded meteorological and pedologic data to evaluate the spatial Rs variations in China from 2000 to 2013. We analysed the relationship between Rs and environmental factors, and suggest management strategies that may help to keep the terrestrial carbon balance. The simulated results demonstrate that the mean annual Rs value over these 14 years was 422 g/m2/year, and the corresponding total amount was 4.01 Pg C/year. The Rs estimation displayed a clear spatial pattern and a slightly increasing trend. Further analysis also indicated that high Rs values may occur in areas that show a greater degree of synchronicity in the timing of their optimal temperature and moisture conditions. Moreover, cultivated vegetation exhibits higher Rs values than native vegetation. Finally, we suggest that specific conservation efforts should be focused on ecologically sensitive areas where the Rs values increase significantly.</jats:p	['SDG13']

These systems take advantage of existing superstructures such as offshore platforms, lightships, piers, breakwaters or are placed on specially designed buoys or underwater oceanographic structures. These systems commonly use various sensors to measure parameters such as dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, pH or fluorescence. Emphasis has to be put on the long term quality of measurements, yet sensors may face very short-term biofouling effects. Biofouling can disrupt the quality of the measurements, sometimes in less than a week. Many techniques to prevent biofouling on instrumentation are listed and studied by researchers and manufacturers. Very few of them are implemented on instruments and of those very few have been tested in situ on oceanographic sensors for deployment of at least one or two months. This paper presents a review of techniques used to protect against biofouling of in situ sensors and gives a short list and description of promising techniques	['SDG14']
10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00902.x	Microbial community structure of a heavy fuel oil-degrading marine consortium: Linking microbial dynamics with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon utilization	A marine microbial consortium obtained from a beach contaminated by the Prestige oil spill proved highly efficient in removing the different hydrocarbon families present in this heavy fuel oil. Seawater cultures showed a complete removal of all the linear and branched alkanes, an extensive attack on three to five-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs; including anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a) anthracene, chrysene, and benzo(a) pyrene] (30-100%), and a considerable depletion of their alkyl derivatives. Community dynamics analysis revealed that Alcanivorax species, known alkane degraders, predominated in the initial stages. This was followed by an increase in Alphaproteobacteria (i.e. Maricaulis, Roseovarius), which coincided with the depletion of low molecular PAHs. Finally, these were succeeded by Gammaproteobacteria (mainly Marinobacter and Methylophaga), which were involved in the degradation of the high molecular-weight PAHs. The role of these populations in the removal of the specific components was confirmed by the analysis of subcultures established using the aliphatic or the aromatic fraction of the fuel oil, or single PAHs, as carbon sources. The genus Marinobacter seemed to play a major role in the degradation of a variety of hydrocarbons, as several members of this group were isolated from the different enrichment cultures and grew on plates with hexadecane or single PAHs as sole carbon sources.status: publishe	['SDG14']

As articulated in many international and national ocean policies, conventions and agreements, there is widespread agreement that adaptive, ecosystem-based approaches are needed to manage climate risks and to adapt to the impacts of climate change on our environment. Design and implementation of such approaches requires routine and continuous provision of data and information that enable regular assessments of the states of marine and estuarine ecosystems, changes in states and likely future states in terms of their capacity to support goods and services. The provision of these data and information is a major goal of the climate and coastal modules of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), the oceans and coastal component of the Global Earth Observing System, which is coming into being through an international effort led by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) to integrate, improve and build on existing monitoring and modelling capabilities.    The objective is to establish sustained, integrated and interoperable approaches that efficiently link observations and models through data management and communications on national, regional and global scales. Initial requirements for the climate module have been completed and global implementation has begun. However, implementation of coastal GOOS has been slow and uneven geographically, especially in the coastal zones of developing countries and emerging economies. Challenges that must be addressed to move this process along more rapidly and effectively include (a) capacity building; (b) reaching international agreements that enable timely exchanges of data on the states and changing states of coastal ecosystems regionally and globally; (c) achieving international consensus on priorities for phased implementation of coastal GOOS strategic plans; (d) establishing mechanisms to transition advances in science and technology into operational modes as needed; (e) effecting regional and global coordination and collaboration among coastal nations and existing regional bodies with related goals and data requirements; and (f) coordinating the development of the climate and coastal modules of GOOS. Issues associated with these challenges are discussed and the current effort of the GOOS Scientific Steering Committee to document observing system requirements for the coastal ocean is described	['SDG14']

Needed for mitigation efforts and to guide scientific investigations was a system for tracking the oil, both at the surface and at depth. We report on such system, implemented immediately upon spill onset, by marshaling numerical model and satellite remote sensing resources available from existing coastal ocean observing activities. Surface oil locations inferred from satellite imagery were used to initialize the positions of the virtual particles in an ensemble of trajectory models, and the particles were tracked using forecast surface currents, with new particles added to simulate the continual release of oil from the well. Three dimensional subsurface tracking were also performed from the well site location at several different depths. Timely trajectory forecasts were used to plan scientific surveys and other spill response activities	['SDG14']

10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.356-360.903	Construction of an indicator system for integrated assessment of environmental quality of the Dianchi Basin	There are few indicator systems available for monitoring and assessing the environmental quality of large-scale regions. We constructed an indicator system for integrated assessment of the environmental quality of the Dianchi Basin. First, the definition of regional environmental quality is determined by both the supply of materials and energy in the region and the extent to which the region is polluted. Second, the indicator categories used for assessment mainly comprise vegetation biomass and the concentrations of various pollutants. Third, owing to spatial heterogeneity of a region, evaluation of the regional environment first requires division into sub-regions, each of which should be relatively homogeneous with regard to physical conditions (e.g. marine and terrestrial) and appearance (e.g. vegetation cover). Finally, the mathematical models for assessing regional environmental quality can be built according to the relationships between the various indicators, the sub-regions and regional environmental quality. The indicator system built using this approach can reflect environmental changes over time and identifies reasons for environmental variation.</jats:p	['SDG14']

10.1155/2012/981365	Effects of three types of oil dispersants on biodegradation of dispersed crude oil in water surrounding two Persian Gulf provinces	Objective. To determine the most effective and biodegradable dispersant of spilled oil in water surrounding two Persian Gulf provinces. Methods. This study compared the effects of three dispersants, Pars 1, Pars 2, and Gamlen OD4000 on removal of oil in two Persian Gulf provinces' water. Overall, 16 stations were selected. Using the Well method, the growth rate of isolated bacteria and fungi was identified. To specify the growth rate of microorganisms and their usage of oil in the presence of the above-mentioned dispersants, as exclusive sources of carbon, the bacteria were grown in culture medium for 28 days at 120 rpm, 30∘C, and their optical density was measured by spectrophotometry. Then, we tested biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in microorganisms. Results. The highest growth rate was documented for the growth of microorganisms on either Pars 1 or Pars 2 dispersants or their mixtures with oil. However, the culture having microorganisms grown on Pars 1 had higher BOD and COD than the other two dispersants (9200 and 16800 versus 500 and 960, P<0.05). Mixture of oil and Pars 2 as well as oil and Pars 1 dispersants showed the highest BODs and CODs, respectively. In the Bahregan province, microorganisms grown on Pars 2 had maximum amount of BOD and COD in comparison with Pars 1 and Gamlen dispersants (7100 and 15200 versus 6000 and 10560, P<0.05). Conclusion. Pars 1 and Pars 2 were the most effective dispersants with highest degradability comparing Gamlen. In each region, the most suitable compound for removing oil spill from offshores with least secondary contamination should be investigated	['SDG14']

10.1016/j.fishres.2013.01.002	Modeling the spatial distribution of commercially important reef fishes on the West Florida Shelf	Understanding the spatial distribution of a species is an important precondition to successfully managing marine populations. For reef fishes, this is of particular importance due to the patchy nature of reef communities. This study estimated the spatial distribution of five reef fish species on the West Florida Shelf: gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis), mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), red grouper (Epinephelus morio), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens). Estimation was done by combining large-scale fishery-dependent catch per unit of fishing effort with small scale fishery-independent video survey observation. Catch per unit of fishing effort was obtained from vessel logbook data while video observations of reef fish presence–absence and relative abundance were made by stratified random sampling on known reef and hard-bottom habitat in the Gulf of Mexico. Relative abundance estimates showed different abundance patterns for the five species depending on depth and geographical area. Variogram modeling suggested that gag grouper, mutton snapper, and red grouper were spatially autocorrelated on reef or hard-bottom habitats at short ranges of between 0.87 and 0.95 km, while red and vermilion snapper were found to be randomly distributed. Range estimates for gag grouper, mutton snapper and red grouper were supported by variograms of depth soundings in the Gulf which produced range estimates of between 1.56 and 6.34 km. Combining the relative estimates of abundance from catch per unit of effort with the spatial autocorrelation parameters from video surveys allowed us to provide stochastic fish abundance estimates at scales of about 2 km2	['SDG14']

10.1111/eva.12042	Oceanographic connectivity and environmental correlates of genetic structuring in Atlantic herring in the Baltic Sea	Marine fish often show little genetic structuring in neutral marker genes, and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in the Baltic Sea are no exception; historically, very low levels of population differentiation (F(ST) ≍ 0.002) have been found, despite a high degree of interpopulation environmental heterogeneity in salinity and temperature. Recent exome sequencing and SNP studies have however shown that many loci are under selection in this system. Here, we combined population genetic analyses of a large number of transcriptome-derived microsatellite markers with oceanographic modelling to investigate genetic differentiation and connectivity in Atlantic herring at a relatively fine scale within the Baltic Sea. We found evidence for weak but robust and significant genetic structuring (F(ST) = 0.008) explainable by oceanographic connectivity. Genetic differentiation was also associated with site differences in temperature and salinity, with the result driven by the locus Her14 which appears to be under directional selection (F(ST) = 0.08). The results show that Baltic herring are genetically structured within the Baltic Sea, and highlight the role of oceanography and environmental factors in explaining this structuring. The results also have implications for the management of herring fisheries, the most economically important fishery in the Baltic Sea, suggesting that the current fisheries management units may be in need of revision	['SDG14']

Samples were collected from the northern Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea, and the Scott Reef off Western Australia. Phylogenetic trees and a minimum spanning tree were developed from these data to elucidate evolutionary relationships. These data demonstrate significant evolutionary separation of each of the three populations into strongly supported discrete clades matching geographic stratification. Within each of the discrete populations, genetic variation is evident. Strong inter-population variation is evident, with discrete geographic clades being recognized for each extant group. The distinct spatial subdivision between east and west Australian populations of Nautilus are related to geographic and physical isolation over evolutionary time, and this has important fisheries management implications. The distinct geographic patterns of genetic structuring demonstrated by these data indicate the existence of discrete eastern and western Australian management units, and as such, these Nautilus populations should be managed discretely, as each has a high conservation value containing unique genetic variation	['SDG14']

10.1371/journal.pone.0086732	Food sources for Ruditapes philippinarum in a coastal Lagoon determined by mass balance and stable isotope approaches	The relationship between the food demand of a clam population (Ruditapes philippinarum (Adams & Reeve 1850)) and the isotopic contributions of potential food sources (phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, and organic matter derived from the sediment surface, seagrass, and seaweeds) to the clam diet were investigated. In particular, we investigated the manner in which dense patches of clams with high secondary productivity are sustained in a coastal lagoon ecosystem (Hichirippu Lagoon) in Hokkaido, Japan. Clam feeding behavior should affect material circulation in this lagoon owing to their high secondary productivity (ca. 130 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Phytoplankton were initially found to constitute 14-77% of the clam diet, although phytoplankton nitrogen content (1.79-4.48 kmol N) and the food demand of the clam (16.2 kmol N d(-1)) suggest that phytoplankton can constitute only up to 28% of clam dietary demands. However, use of isotopic signatures alone may be misleading. For example, the contribution of microphytobenthos (MPB) were estimated to be 0-68% on the basis of isotopic signatures but was subsequently shown to be 35 ± 13% (mean ± S.D.) and 64 ± 4% (mean ± S.D.) on the basis of phytoplankton biomass and clam food demand respectively, suggesting that MPB are the primary food source for clams. Thus, in the present study, the abundant MPB in the subtidal area appear to be a key food source for clams, suggesting that these MPB may sustain the high secondary production of the clam	['SDG14']

10.3354/cr01244	Observed changes and variability of atmospheric parameters in the Baltic Sea region during the last 200 years	The Baltic Sea is located in Northern Europe and exhibits significant climate variability, with influence of air masses from arctic to subtropical origin. By updating and discussing results described in the framework of the BACC project (BALTEX Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin), this study presents observed changes in atmospheric parameters during the last 200 yr. Circulation patterns show large decadal variability with a northward shift of storm tracks and increased cyclonic activity in recent decades with increased persistence of weather types. However, the wind climate shows no robust long-term trends, and is dominated by pronounced (multi-)decadal variability. Near-surface temperatures show continued warming, in particular during spring and winter; this is stronger over northern regions. Up to this point, no long-term trends are detectable for precipitation, although some regional indications exist for an increased length of precipitation periods, and possibly an increased risk of extreme precipitation events.</p	['SDG14']

10.1093/icesjms/fst230	Characterizing foodweb structure to identify potential ecosystem effects of fishing in the Ross Sea, Antarctica	AbstractThe potential ecosystem effects of fishing for Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Ross Sea region were investigated. Mixed trophic impact analysis was applied to a model of the Ross Sea foodweb and used to calculate the relative trophic importances of species and trophic groups in the system. The trophic impact of toothfish on medium-sized demersal fish was identified as the strongest top-down interaction in the system based on multiple-step analysis. This suggests a potential for a strong predation-release effect on some piscine prey of toothfish (especially grenadiers and ice-fish on the Ross Sea slope). However, Antarctic toothfish had moderate trophic importance in the Ross Sea foodweb as a whole, and the analysis did not support the hypothesis that changes to toothfish will cascade through the ecosystem by simple trophic effects. Because of limitations of this kind of analysis, cascading effects on the Ross Sea ecosystem due to changes in the abundance of toothfish cannot be ruled out, but for such changes to occur a mechanism other than simple trophic interactions is likely to be involved. Trophic importances were highest in the middle of the foodweb where silverfish and krill are known to have a key role in ecosystem structure and function. The six groups with the highest indices of trophic importance were (in decreasing order): phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, Antarctic silverfish, small demersal fish, Antarctic krill and cephalopods. Crystal krill and small pelagic fish also had high trophic importance in some analyses. Strengths and limitations of this kind of analysis are presented. In particular, it is noted that the analysis only considers trophic interactions at the spatial, temporal and ecological scale of the whole Ross Sea shelf and slope area, averaged over a typical year and in 35 trophic groups. Interference and density-dependent effects were not included in this analysis. Effects at smaller spatial and temporal scales, and effects concerning only parts of populations, were not resolved by the analysis, and this is likely to underestimate the potential risks of fishing to Weddell seals and type-C killer whales.</jats:p	['SDG14']

10.2110/jsr.2015.38	Mud-rich density-driven flows along an early Ordovician storm-dominated shoreline: Implications for shallow-marine facies models	Copyright © 2015, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology). Dynamic physical and biological seafloor processes shape the three-dimensional stratal architecture of modern and ancient mud-dominated continental shelves. When evaluating a mudstone unit as a potential source, reservoir, or seal, it is imperative to understand the physical, biological, and chemical seafloor processes that control mudstone depositional fabric and diagenesis. This study presents sedimentological, ichnological, and geochemical data of exceptionally preserved mudstone originating from hyperpycnal and possible combined-flow deposits in the Lower Ordovician (Tremadocian) Beach Formation, Bell Island Group, Newfoundland. Seven mudstone facies are described, based on textural, compositional, and ichnological characteristics. Mudstone deposits interpreted to originate from hyperpycnal flows are well cemented, exhibit high chlorite-:illite ratios, and contain sharp grain-size changes, commonly forming beds with tripartite subdivisions. Deposits of waveenhanced sediment gravity flows are, in contrast, poorly cemented illitic mudstone. These mudstone facies exhibit decimeter-thick wave or combined-flow structures within siltstone and very fine sandstone beds as well as laterally discontinuous, nonbioturbated mudstone layers. Beds of this facies have abundant mudstone-on-mudstone and mudstone-on-sandstone erosional contacts. Low organic carbon loading from the nonvegetated early Paleozoic hinterland, combined with a high reworking frequency on a shallow marine wave-dominated shelf, is inferred to have resulted in high remineralization efficiency, and low preservation potential of reactive organic carbon. Burial efficiency and bioavailability of organic matter are considered to be the critical variables controlling infaunal colonization and bioturbation in mud-dominated open-coastline paleoenvironments. This work demonstrates that ancient fine-grained coastal systems are incompletely incorporated into sequence stratigraphic models owing to their atypical proximal-to-distal facies relationships. It is proposed that the spatial organization of fine-grained sediment and facies architecture in such systems are controlled by: 1) frequency of sediment supply events, 2) direction of mud transport, 3) diagenetic reactivity of minerals and bioavailable organic carbon, and (4) residence time of mineral grains and organic matter close to the sediment-water interface	['SDG14']

10.1139/er-2014-0049	Beyond rhetoric: Navigating the conceptual tangle towards effective implementation of the ecosystem approach to oceans management	The ecosystem approach is widely considered the best paradigm for environmental management and oceans management. With such ample endorsement, one could expect that the concept has an unambiguous definition and that its implications for management are clear. That is not the case. The concept has provoked an extensive academic and practical debate over the last 30 years. Early work focused on debates about the concept of the ecosystem approach, its guiding principles, and consistent use of terminology. As those questions were progressively clarified, the work has focused on its implementation. This paper provides a three-part literature review of these developments. The first part analyzes the current understanding of the ecosystem approach, its consensual elements or principles, the differing terminology coined in the literature, and three sources of persisting confusion around the concept. The paper addresses in particular one of those sources of confusion: the goal of the ecosystem approach. The second part focuses on implementation frameworks and strategies, with particular focus on objective-based and adaptive management frameworks and the pivotal role of ecosystem indicators in understanding, assessing, and managing ecosystems. The third part reviews the recognition of ecosystems and the ecosystem approach in international law, including an analysis of nonbinding instruments, treaty law (with particular reference to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, and the Convention on Biological Diversity), and the practical regional implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries and oceans management. The literature review demonstrates that, despite some persisting differing interpretations, the ecosystem approach has moved from the theory of aspirational discourse to the practice of implementation. It has proven successful in enhancing the understanding of ecosystems’ structure, function, and dynamics; increasing awareness of environmental problems; and developing policy and research agendas and priorities. However, the jury is still out in relation to its capacity to influence human behavior through direct management actions. Many factors concur to this limitation, but two stand out: the inadequacy of traditional regulatory frameworks and institutional arrangements to capture the complexity, uncertainty, and variability of ecosystems; and the reluctance of the international community to embrace a global, comprehensive, and substantive international obligation that effectively protects the ecological systems on which life on Earth depends. </jats:p	['SDG14']

The causes of these changes are numerous and varied. All components of the Antarctic environment are linked – the hydrosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere and biosphere all respond to changes in any part of these systems, sometimes resulting in feedback mechanisms that amplify or accelerate changes that are underway. This complexity means that the causes and the consequences of climate change can be difficult to determine but some of the range of physical, biological and chemical impacts of climate change are starting to emerge or are already well established, and future effects can begin to be estimated. There is an extensive and wide-ranging literature on recent Antarctic climate change. In particular there is a comprehensive report by Turner et al. (Antarctic climate change and the environment. SCAR, Cambridge, pp 526, 2009), subject of an overview in Convey et al. (Antarct Sci 21:541–563, 2009)	['SDG14']
10.1111/maec.12277	Climate change and warm-water species at the north-western boundary of the Mediterranean Sea	International audienceThe effects of global change are particularly serious in areas where range shiftsof species are physically constrained such as the Ligurian Sea, which is one ofthe coldest sectors of the Mediterranean. In this basin, historical informationon water temperature (from the sea surface down to 75 m depth) dates backto the 1950s. Early studies also recorded warm-water species occurrence.Thanks to these data we provide the first detailed characterization of watertemperature variation from 1958 up to 2010 in the layer 0–75 m depth. Wecoupled this analysis with the available information on rocky reef epibenthiccommunities (literature review from 1955 to 1964 and field data from 1980 to2010). The analysis of water temperature revealed several patterns of variation:a cooling phase from 1958 to 1980, a phase of rapid warming from 1980 to1990 and a phase of slower warming from 1990 to 2010. Inter-annual variationin temperature increased over the entire period for the water layer down to20 m. Warm-water native and alien species richness increased during thewarming phases. Literature estimates suggest a decrease in warm-water nativespecies richness during the cooling phase. The analysis of quantitative data collectedin the early 1990s and late 2000s indicated a decrease in the cover ofwarm-water native species on shallow rocky reefs and an increase in deeperwaters. We argue that increased inter-annual variation in water temperaturemay disadvantage native warm-water species in shallow waters. Our resultsindicate that the effect of temperature rises in cold, constrained basins may bemore complex than the simple prediction of species changing their geographicalrange according to their thermal limits	['SDG14']

Organisms with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons are especially susceptible to increasing environmental acidity due to reduction in the saturation state of CaCO3 that accompanies ocean acidification. Creating a connection between human-mediated changes to our environment and the effect it will have on biota is crucial to establishing an understanding of the potential effects of global climate change. We outline two low-cost laboratory experiments that eloquently mimic the biochemical process of ocean acidification on two timescales, providing educators with hands-on, hypothesis-driven experiments that can easily be conducted in middle and high school biology or environmental science courses.</jats:p	['SDG14']

More specifically, parent lipids and some of their oxidation products were quantified in suspended (collected by filtration) and sinking (collected with sediment traps at 5 and 30 m) particles from Resolute Passage (Canada) during a period of spring ice melt in 2012 and the outcomes compared with those obtained from related sea ice samples analyzed previously. Our data show that suspended cells in the near surface waters appeared to be only very weakly affected by photooxidative processes, likely indicative of a community of unaggregated living cells with high seeding potential for further growth. In contrast, we attribute the strong photooxidation state of the organic matter in the sediment traps deployed at 5 m to the presence of senescent and somewhat aggregated sea ice algae that descended only relatively slowly within the euphotic zone, and was thus susceptible to photochemical degradation. On the other hand, the increased abiotic preservation of the sinking material collected in the sediment traps deployed at 30 m, likely reflected more highly aggregated senescent sea ice algae that settled sufficiently rapidly out of the euphotic zone to avoid significant photooxidation. This better-preserved sinking material in the deeper sediment traps may therefore contribute more strongly to the underlying sediments. A three-component conceptual scheme summarizing the abiotic behavior of Arctic sea ice algae in underlying waters is propose	['SDG14']

This study found that vessel visiting Malaysian ports observed the MARPOL 73/78 Annex V requirements; however, identified objects from shipping activity (1.3%; 2 items/km) found on the beaches indicate that there are vessels disposing of garbage illegally at sea. Therefore, there is a need to promote the use of biodegradable material and introduce environmental education to increase awareness on the vessel	['SDG14']

Diel catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates are examined from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl surveys conducted during autumn (1963-2009) and spring (1968-2009). Influential environmental variables on survey catchability are identified for Spiny Dogfish life history stages and five pelagic prey species: Butterfish Peprilus triacanthus, Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus, shortfin squid Illex spp., longfin squid Doryteuthis spp., and Atlantic Mackerel Scomber scombrus. Daytime survey catchability was significantly higher than nighttime catchability for most species during autumn and for mature male Spiny Dogfish, shortfin squid, and longfin squid during spring in the NES LME. For most stages and species examined, breakpoint analyses identified significant increases in CPUE in the morning, peak CPUE during the day, and significant declines in CPUE in the late afternoon. Seasonal probabilities of daytime catch were largely driven by solar zenith angle for most species, with stronger trends identified during autumn. Unadjusted CPUE estimates appear to overestimate absolute abundance, with adjustments resulting in reductions in absolute abundance ranging from 41% for Spiny Dogfish to 91% for shortfin and longfin squids. These findings have important implications for Spiny Dogfish regarding estimates of population consumption of key pelagic prey species and their ecological footprint within the NES LME	['SDG14']

10.1051/e3sconf/20160702004	Methodology to assess coastal infrastructure resilience to climate change	The section of railway which runs along the coastline of south Devon in United Kingdom, from Exeter to Newton Abbot, is one of the most photographed sections of railway in the world. It was opened in 1846 with embankments and seawalls protecting and supporting the railway, providing the route of an atmospheric railway. Despite regular maintenance however, there has been a history of storm damage, one of the most severe occurring in February 2014. This resulted in the collapse of the line, interruption of all rail traffic into and out of the far South- West of the United Kingdom (affecting parts of Devon and the whole of Cornwall) and significant damage to the region’s economy. In order to improve the resilience of the line, several options have been considered to evaluate and reduce climate change impacts to the railway. This paper describes the methodological approach developed to evaluate the risks of flooding for a range of scenarios in the estuary and open coast reaches of the line. Components to derive the present day and future climate change coastal conditions including some possible adaptation measures are also presented together with the results of the hindcasting analysis to assess the performance of the modelling system. An overview of the modelling results obtained to support the development of a long-term Resilience Strategy for asset management is also discussed	['SDG14']

10.1080/14486563.2017.1309694	Managing marine environments and decision-making requires better application of the physical sedimentary sciences	Effective management of marine environments requires a sound understanding of the relevant physical sedimentary sciences. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a key management and decision-making tool employed in Australia for coastal and marine developments. This article examines the veracity of the application of the marine physical sciences within the EIA process, using turbidity measurement and sediment transport pathways as examples. A review of EIA guidance reveals deficiencies in regulation. Turbidity measurement is poorly understood and performed in current practice, while a focus on protecting marine habitats largely ignores those physical sedimentary processes, such as long-term bed-sediment transport pathways, that create and maintain these habitats. Thus evaluations of impacts of offshore activities such as channel dredging and spoil emplacement at sea are fundamentally flawed. An extensive body of scientific knowledge is already available on marine physical processes, and equivalent information for assessments of terrestrial development is routinely taken into consideration. Perhaps practice for the marine environment lags behind that for terrestrial settings or is it a case of ‘out of sight – out of mind’? We call on environmental management professionals to increase engagement with the physical processes that determine the quality of marine environments	['SDG14']

10.1371/journal.pone.0184758	Characterisation of North American Brucella isolates from marine mammals	Extension of known ecological niches of Brucella has included the description of two novel species from marine mammals. Brucella pinnipedialis is associated predominantly with seals, while two major Brucella ceti clades, most commonly associated with porpoises or dolphins respectively, have been identified. To date there has been limited characterisation of Brucella isolates obtained from marine mammals outside Northern European waters, including North American waters. To address this gap, and extend knowledge of the global population structure and host associations of these Brucella species, 61 isolates from marine mammals inhabiting North American waters were subject to molecular and phenotypic characterisation enabling comparison with existing European isolates. The majority of isolates represent genotypes previously described in Europe although novel genotypes were identified in both B. ceti clades. Harp seals were found to carry B. pinnipedialis genotypes previously confined to hooded seals among a diverse repertoire of sequence types (STs) associated with this species. For the first time Brucella isolates were characterised from beluga whales and found to represent a number of distinct B. pinnipedialis genotypes. In addition the known host range of ST27 was extended with the identification of this ST from California sea lion samples. Finally the performance of the frequently used diagnostic tool Bruce-ladder, in differentiating B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis, was critically assessed based on improved knowledge of the global population structure of Brucella associated with marine mammals	['SDG14']

We describe a theory that allows us to understand and predict how marine species react to climate-induced changes in ecological conditions, how communities form and are reconfigured, and so how biodiversity is arranged and may respond to climate change. Our study shows that the responses of species to climate change are therefore intelligible—that is, they have a strong deterministic component and can be predicted	['SDG14']
10.1002/geo2.44	Smaller size-at-age menhaden with coastal warming and fishing intensity	The size-at-age of one million Brevoortia tyrannus and B. patronus, harvested from Maine to Texas over 65 years, were analysed to determine if there was evidence of changes consistent with the well documented temperature size rules. The average annual weight and length for age 3-, 4- and 5-year-old fish declined on both the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (GOM) coasts. For example, the average size of a 4-year-old fish captured in 2010 from the Atlantic and GOM, relative to an average 4-year-old fish captured in 1987, is 15 per cent and 11 per cent lighter, respectively. Small changes in the year-to-year size of same-aged fish were closely related to variations in the annual air temperature (used as a proxy for water temperature) for fish on both coasts. The size-at-age of GOM fish are also smaller during overfished periods compared with underfished periods by 10-24 per cent, and decrease by about the same proportion as indicated by temperature changes. The most plausible explanation for these size changes is that they are a consequence of recent coastal and oceanic warming. These reductions in size-at-age by temperature and fishing pressure affect egg production, oil yield and prey community for one-half of the US Atlantic and GOM fish harvest. The future of menhaden fish size-at-age will be, it seems, smaller as oceanic temperatures rise	['SDG14']

10.3354/meps12697	Ecosystem metabolism of benthic and pelagic zones of a shallow productive estuary: Spatio-temporal variability	Long-term deterioration of water quality is known to reduce the importance of benthic ecosystem metabolism in shallow coastal ecosystems, but drivers of spatial and short-term variability in ecosystem metabolism are poorly understood. We addressed this knowledge gap through detailed seasonal measurements of ecosystem metabolism across depth gradients from shallow (2 to 3 m) eelgrass-dominated to deeper (4 to 5 m) muddy regions of a shallow, productive estuary. Combined measurements of gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and, by difference, net ecosystem production (NEP) by the open-water diel oxygen technique and in situ chamber incubations showed high importance of shallow eelgrass habitats for metabolism at the system scale. Seasonal variations in GPP, R and NEP increased with light availability and temperature with highest NEP in all habitats during the warm and sunny mid-summer. The shallow eelgrass-dominated and neighboring habitats were seasonally net autotrophic (NEP = 0.54 and 0.31 mg O2 m-2 d-1, respectively), compared to net heterotrophy (NEP = -0.26 mg O2 m-2 d-1) at the deeper muddy site. Detailed studies along depth gradients further confirmed the role of eelgrass as a key driver of spatial differences in ecosystem metabolism across the estuary. Strong northerly winds (&gt;8 m s-1) caused short-term (&lt;24 h) periods of similar oxygen dynamics and similar apparent productivity in shallow and deeper waters, indicative of efficient lateral mixing, while calm periods (&lt;4 m s-1) enabled formation of ‘pockets’, i.e. water masses with limited connectivity, which exacerbated the metabolic differences between shallow and deep sites	['SDG14']

It does so by means of a mobilities perspective, which has its origins in sociology and geography. This perspective shifts the analytical focus toward mobilities and environmental problems to understand their governance, as opposed to starting with governance, as many global environmental governance studies do. We coin the term environmental mobilities to refer to the movements of human and nonhuman entities and the environmental factors and impacts associated with these. Environmental mobilities include movements impacting on the environment, movements shaped by environmental factors, and harmful environmental flows, as we illustrate by means of the three cases. We demonstrate how zooming in on the social, material, temporal, and spatial characteristics of these environmental mobilities can help illuminate governance gaps and emerging governance practices that better match their mobile nature. In particular, a mobilities lens helps to understand and capture environmental issues that move, change form, and fluctuate in their central problematique and whose governance is not (yet) highly or centrally institutionalized.</jats:p	['SDG14']
10.1080/08920753.2018.1498714	Factors Influencing Environmentally Responsible Behavior among Coastal Recreationists	An increasing threat to the marine environment is the presence of debris in the ocean, which is predominantly a result of land-based sources and increasing use of single-use packaging items. To begin reducing the amount of debris entering the ocean, human behavior must be addressed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how coastal recreationists behave towards the environment and whether their participation in recreation correlates to their reported behavior specific to marine debris control. Path analysis was used to determine how one’s attitudes, knowledge, recreational activity, and background characteristics influence behavior. Results showed that type of recreational activity had very little impact on behavior and other predictors. From the model, marine environmental concern, connection to the marine environment, and gender most directly influenced reported behavior. Therefore, to encourage change in recreationists’ relevant behavior, the results indicate social groups where behavior change efforts could initially be made. Additionally, the marine environmental concerns of different demographic groups should be considered and used in developing programs directed at increasing environmentally responsible behavior with emphasis on marine debris	['SDG14']

10.1139/x09-162	Temporal changes in species composition of mixedwood stands in northwest New Brunswick: 1946-2008	Patterns of softwood (SW) – hardwood (HW) change from 1946 to 2006 in 32 unharvested mixedwood (MW) stands in northern New Brunswick were analyzed using aerial photographs (1946, 1966, 1982, and 2006), sampled, and related to disturbance and stand conditions. Five stand development patterns were identified based on 1946 SW content (70%–80%, termed SW versus 30%–60%, termed MW) and change in SW content from 1946 to 2006 (SW-stable, SW-declining, MW-fluctuating, MW-stable, or MW-declining). Species composition was surprisingly changeable over this 60-year period, with change in SW content varying from +18% to –62%. High canopy cover reduction from 1946 to 1966 resulted from balsam fir ( Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) mortality due to old age and a 1950s spruce budworm ( Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreak plus birch ( Betula sp.) dieback. SW-stable stands that maintained SW composition from 1946 to 2006 (+7%) had more red spruce ( Picea rubens Sarg.) than all other classes in which SW declined by 15%–47%. SW-declining stands were located on southerly aspects (189°) and had higher mean elevations (423 m) than other classes. Results suggest that balsam fir – tolerant HW MW stands may be naturally transitional due to disturbance, species, and stand conditions, which has significant implications for forest management designed to maintain static proportions of MW and SW stands.</jats:p	['SDG15']

The analysis focuses on eight eco-innovation projects representing the Aquitaine wood filiere, and carried out under the aegis of the Industries and Maritime Pine of the Future 'competitiveness cluster.' We show that dependence on the wood natural resource can configure the limits, objectives and expected performance of such innovation systems. While previous approaches have considered similar innovation systems from territorial, sectoral or technological perspectives, we argue that centering the analysis on this natural resource better enables consideration of the technological and environmental tensions and risks that are likely to destabilize the system	['SDG15']
10.1614/wt-09-009.1	Environment and soil conditions influence pre- and postemergence herbicide efficacy in soybean	Deciding on the most efficacious PRE and POST herbicide options and their ideal application timing can be challenging for soybean producers. Climatic events during the 14 d before and after herbicide application can further complicate decisions because of their influence on herbicide effectiveness. Nine field trials were conducted at three locations in southwestern Ontario from 2003 to 2006, to determine the most effective PRE and POST soybean herbicides for control of common lambsquarters, common ragweed, green foxtail, and redroot pigweed. When precipitation was low at least 7 d before and after herbicide application weed control was reduced in treatments that included imazethapyr (PRE or POST) or flumetsulam/S-metolachlor (a premix formulation) (PRE). Cumulative precipitation during the 12 d after PRE application that exceeded the monthly average by at least 60% reduced common lambsquarters control when metribuzin was applied and green foxtail control when imazethapyr was applied. Delaying application of imazethapyr + bentazon to a later soybean growth stage decreased control of common lambsquarters and green foxtail; however, environmental conditions appeared to influence these results. Precipitation on the day of application decreased control of common ragweed and redroot pigweed more with quizalofop-p-ethyl + thifensulfuron-methyl + bentazon compared with imazethapyr + bentazon. Soybean yield varied among POST herbicide treatments because of reduced weed control. This research confirms that environmental conditions pre- and postapplication, as well as application timing, influence herbicide efficacy and should be considered by growers when selecting an herbicide program.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1068/a42265	Green lungs: Good firewood, healthy air, and embodied forest politics	In southern Chile a coalition of environmental, labor, and municipal leaders is rolling out a novel approach to environmental regulation. The National Firewood Certification System provides a seal of approval to firewood that is produced and sold according to standards of sustainability, transparency, and quality. Firewood certification is distinct from Fair Trade, organic, or other market-based programs to the extent that it blurs the lines between nature conservation (preserving native forest) and public health (improving indoor air quality, controlling urban smog). Certification's advocates are explicit about leveraging the public health dimension of ‘good’ (ie clean, dry) firewood to promote ‘good’ (ie sustainable, conservationist) management of native forest; they are quite literally networking lungs to forests. I had come to Chile to study forest certification in a very different register— an international NGO certifying million-hectare plantations for the global pulp market. The local and provisional quality of the firewood program made for a striking contrast, but not as striking as the immediacy and physicality of the product: the firewood itself. As I hacked and wheezed in front of my woodstove, as I considered that I was perhaps exposing my family's lungs to carcinogens and acute respiratory infections, I came to see the consumer–producer networks of certification in a different light. This paper examines firewood certification as a market-based social movement and as a visceral experiment in creating environmental consciousness. My ethnographic perspective is informed by heat, smoke, and aching lungs. </jats:p	['SDG15']

Uncertainty, moral hazard, and incomplete knowledge of NPPP make conventional policy instruments applied to point source pollution problems difficult addressing NPP problems. NPP regulatory policies should be designed to induce agricultural producers to change their production practices in ways that improve the environmental. The economic literature on NPP has not considered the possible use of both voluntary and mandatory approaches as complementary parts of a policy package. Factors influencing farmers’ cooperative action to conserve environmental public goods are critical in regulatory policy formation in transitional China with huge amount of small subsistence farmers. Under a changed political environment, a joint effort between government and farmers is the approach most favored to address NPP issues, under which relationships between environmental outcomes and agricultural production must be accounted for.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1371/journal.pone.0015734	Cross-scale analysis of the region effect on vascular plant species diversity in southern and northern european mountain ranges	Background: The divergent glacial histories of southern and northern Europe affect present-day species diversity at coarse-grained scales in these two regions, but do these effects also penetrate to the more fine-grained scales of local communities? Methodology/Principal Findings: We carried out a cross-scale analysis to address this question for vascular plants in two mountain regions, the Alps in southern Europe and the Scandes in northern Europe, using environmentally paired vegetation plots in the two regions (n = 403 in each region) to quantify four diversity components: (i) total number of species occurring in a region (total gamma-diversity), (ii) number of species that could occur in a target plot after environmental filtering (habitat-specific gamma-diversity), (iii) pair-wise species compositional turnover between plots (plot-to-plot beta-diversity) and (iv) number of species present per plot (plot alpha-diversity). We found strong region effects on total gamma-diversity, habitat-specific gamma-diversity and plot-to-plot beta-diversity, with a greater diversity in the Alps even towards distances smaller than 50 m between plots. In contrast, there was a slightly greater plot alpha-diversity in the Scandes, but with a tendency towards contrasting region effects on high and low soil-acidity plots. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that there are strong regional differences between coarse-grained (landscape-to regional-scale) diversity components of the flora in the Alps and the Scandes mountain ranges, but that these differences do not necessarily penetrate to the finest-grained (plot-scale) diversity component, at least not on acidic soils. Our findings are consistent with the contrasting regional Quaternary histories, but we also consider alternative explanatory models. Notably, ecological sorting and habitat connectivity may play a role in the unexpected limited or reversed region effect on plot alpha-diversity, and may also affect the larger-scale diversity components. For instance, plot connectivity and/or selection for high dispersal ability may increase plot alpha-diversity and compensate for low total gamma-diversity	['SDG15']
10.1051/mmnp/20116109	Modeling dryland landscapes	The discovery of nearly periodic vegetation patterns in arid and semi-arid regions           motivated numerous model studies in the past decade. Most studies have focused on           vegetation pattern formation, and on the response of vegetation patterns to gradients of           the limiting water resource. The reciprocal question, what resource modifications are           induced by vegetation pattern formation, which is essential to the understanding of           dryland landscapes, has hardly been addressed. This paper is a synthetic review of model           studies that address this question and the consequent implications for inter-specific           plant interactions and species diversity. It focuses both on patch and landscape scales,           highlighting bottom-up processes, where plant interactions at the patch scale give rise to           spatial patterns at the landscape scale, and top-down processes, where pattern transitions           at the landscape scale affect inter-specific interactions at the patch scale	['SDG15']

International audiencePurpose – Companiesthattrytobuildsustainablesupplychainsorthathavetoreengineertheirsupply chains to face sustainable development issues are confronted with such a complex and uncertain context that scanning their environment becomes more than ever necessary. This paper makes up the first stage of a research program. It aims to find an adequate scanning approach for sustainable supply chain design. Design/methodology/approach – The research follows a two-steps methodology. First, it looks for appropriate scanning frameworks by reviewing the dedicated literature. Second, it gathers ideas and knowledge combining an analysis of sustainable supply chain empirical studies with the collection of experts’ scanning know-how, by means of semi-structured interviews.Findings – This first stage of the research program suggests use of a multi-and interrelated levels scope for sustainable scanning with a network perspective. The renewed target approach it promotes results in modifying scanning priorities. The overall findings shape up the first draft of a sustainable scanning framework, including a multi-levels scope of analysis, a list of sustainable targets and a first contribution concerning scanning methods and attitudes.Research limitations/implications – The relevance of our scanning framework needs further testing to validate its usefulness and provide recommendations for managers.Practical implications – The paper proposes a scanning framework and a list of targets that could be implemented by professionals.Originality/value – The contribution in this paper is to link environmental scanning and sustainable development adding a supply chain orientation, and to propose a conceptual “sustainable scanning framework”. It is hoped that further research will prove that it has interesting managerial implications for companies challenged by sustainable development issues	['SDG15']

10.3106/041.036.0207	A morphological analysis of Malaysian Kerivoula (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae)	Recent identification of new species within the genus Kerivoula from the Southeast Asian region has indicated that this genus was understudied and currently underestimated in terms of its species diversity. Thus, this morphological study was carried out to record and analyse the morphological characters of available specimens of Malaysian Kerivoula from the Museum of Zoology, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. Thirty-one external, skull and dental characters were taken and analysed using the multivariate analysis, dicriminant function analysis. As the result, six groupings of Kerivoula was identified, namely K. intermedia, K. hardwickii, K. pellucida, K. lenis and K. papulosa which were divided into two distinctive groupings of K. papulosa type large (K. papillosa type L, hereafter) and K. papillosa type small (K. papillosa type S, hereafter). Variable dentary length was identified as the best predictor to characterize each group of Kerivoula. The separation of the K. papulosa specimens into two separate morphotypes were characterised by their different sizes whereby the former group was larger in size compared to the latter. It is suggested that each represents an independent species even though both morphotypes occur sympatrically. The homogenising effect of the previous environmental events might have been the primary factor of the sympatric occurrence of both morphotypes. Nevertheless, further study regarding ecology, morphology and genetics should be carried out to provide a better insight regarding the cryptic population of K. papillosa in Borneo and Malaysia	['SDG15']

Here, we show that restoration projects can be effective in enhancing both, but that conflicts can arise, especially if single services are targeted in isolation. Furthermore, recovery of biodiversity and services can be slow and incomplete. Despite this uncertainty, new methods of ecosystem service valuation are suggesting that the economic benefits of restoration can outweigh costs. Payment for Ecosystem Service schemes could therefore provide incentives for restoration, but require development to ensure biodiversity and multiple services are enhanced and the needs of different stakeholders are met. Such approaches must be implemented widely if new global restoration targets are to be achieved.Comunidad de MadridMinisterio de Ciencia y Educación, EspañaUK Centre for Ecology & Hydrolog	['SDG15']

10.1177/0309133311420941	Environmental decision making and an ecosystems approach: Some challenges from the perspective of social science	This paper explores issues of theoretical design and application arising from ecosystem service based approaches to natural resource management. Conserving ecosystem services is now a key normative goal of environmental decision making, but the implications of embracing this concept are still little understood. In this paper I highlight two recurring and cross-cutting aspects of an ecosystems approach around which credible treatments of ecosystem services can be realized, not only in theory, but also in practice: first, the need to think 'holistically' about how any given project, proposal or plan would impact on service provision and human well-being; and, second, the need to manage ecosystem services in relation to wider stakeholder values, needs and priorities. While thinking about decision making from the perspective of ecosystem services is no panacea for sustainability, the paper points to a number of social science issues that interdisciplinary researchers could usefully address in these two contexts if they are to harness this concept in creative and critically engaged ways.

10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.10.001	The mosaic of habitats in the high-altitude Brazilian rupestrian fields is a hotspot for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	The high diversity in rupestrian field vegetation has been attributed to the mosaic of environments formed by several soil classes, rugged relief and microclimatic variation. Although advances in the knowledge of some biological areas in rupestrian fields have been made, little is known about the relevance of soil microorganisms and their relationships with the vegetation. Symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is one of the most studied interactions between microorganisms and plants, because they are ubiquitous and contribute to the sustainability of ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and diversity of AMF species and to evaluate their relationship with soil physicochemical attributes and plant diversity in different habitats of the rupestrian fields from the Cadeia do Espinhaço, Serra do Cipó, Brazil. These rupestrian fields were delimited into five distinct habitats: rock outcrop, quartz gravel fields, sandy bogs, peat bogs and the Cerrado. Forty-nine AMF species were identified as belonging to nine families and twelve genera. Among them, Acaulospora colossica and Pacispora dominikii were found for the first time in Brazil. The results of this study suggest that the diversity of AMF is related to the heterogeneity of habitats and that the soil texture (coarse sand, gravel and silt) is better related to the structure of these fungi communities than to the soil chemical attributes. Plant species richness was related to AMF richness only in the quartz gravel field, rocky outcrop, and sandy bog habitats. Considering these habitats constitute one of the most menaced ecosystems on the planet, our survey provides information to improve knowledge about rupestrian field biodiversity, thus supporting policy actions for its conservation and preservation	['SDG15']

Taking advantage of this physical and economic handicap, an organized group of social and political activists called Left-Wing Extremists (LWE), perpetrating violence and keeping the people of this region under threat. Non-cooperation of local population being the prime obstacle, government security forces with all its intelligence network and muscle power had not been utterly succeed to stop these activities. This UGC (University Grant Commission - Govt. of India) sponsored ‘Minor Research Project’ plans for economic and social stabilization of this region through the promotion of alternate economic practices for underprivileged forest dwellers and involving them in anti-terrorism operations. Taking into account the severity of physical environment and minimum skill level of tribal people, implementation of ‘Ecotourism’ in these forest villages seems to be the most suitable income-generating and ecologically permissible activity. Due to essentially spatially distributed nature of tourism and terrorism related data and need of various types of spatial and statistical analysis GIS has proven to be a successful means in this study and based on spatial, non-spatial and attribute data overlay („Weighted Sum Overlay Analysis’- ARC-GIS 9.2), ecotourism potential zones were identified. The inputs in the form of arc-coverages were assigned relative weightages according to their influence/importance in ecotourism development. Cadastral level action plan maps have been prepared for ecotourism infrastructure development and sustainable land use practices. Spatial database created on last ten years extremist movements and terrorist attacks to identify the spatial pattern, association and causes of vulnerability of the hot spots.

10.1890/11-0758.1	Community occupancy responses of small mammals to restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests, northern Arizona, USA	In western North American conifer forests, wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity due to heavy fuel loads that have accumulated after a century of fire suppression. Forest restoration treatments (e.g., thinning and/or burning) are being designed and implemented at large spatial and temporal scales in an effort to reduce fire risk and restore forest structure and function. In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, predominantly open forest structure and a frequent, low-severity fire regime constituted the evolutionary environment for wildlife that persisted for thousands of years. Small mammals are important in forest ecosystems as prey and in affecting primary production and decomposition. During 2006–2009, we trapped eight species of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona and used occupancy modeling to determine community responses to thinning and habitat features. The most important covariates in predicting small mammal occupancy were understory vegetation cover, large snags, and treatment. Our analysis identified two generalist species found at relatively high occupancy rates across all sites, four open-forest species that responded positively to treatment, and two dense-forest species that responded negatively to treatment unless specific habitat features were retained. Our results indicate that all eight small mammal species can benefit from restoration treatments, particularly if aspects of their evolutionary environment (e.g., large trees, snags, woody debris) are restored. The occupancy modeling approach we used resulted in precise species-level estimates of occupancy in response to habitat attributes for a greater number of small mammal species than in other comparable studies. We recommend our approach for other studies faced with high variability and broad spatial and temporal scales in assessing impacts of treatments or habitat alteration on wildlife species. Moreover, since forest planning efforts are increasingly focusing on progressively larger treatment implementation, better and more efficiently obtained ecological information is needed to inform these efforts	['SDG15']

10.4028/www.scientific.net/kem.517.20	Application of non-conventional materials: Evaluation criteria for environmental conservation in brazil	The present worldwide socio economical system created the actual situation where almost two third of world population lives under the minimum living conditions which have been established by the United Nations criteria. To overcome these deficiencies, there is an urgent need to establish a new paradigm for promoting conservation and environmental sustainability. This paper presents the evaluation criteria for this major concern. The main variables considered are: sufficient availability, renewability, adequate physical-mechanical characteristics, cost efficiency, easy access, simple production, local technology adapted to local conditions, and durability. The non-conventional materials and technologies (NOCMAT) minimize adverse impacts into the environment and also provide adequate products for a market increasingly competitive. Thus, very strict norms and clean technologies should be implemented. Positive results in Brazilian research institutions have been developed on the use of NOCMAT (bamboo, vegetable fibers, bio-composites, recycled conventional materials, etc.) since 1979 at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio, Department of Civil Engineering). Nevertheless, these NOCMAT are not yet sufficiently disseminated and employed in the country due to the lack of sufficient investments. Thus, government incentives and private initiatives must be increased substantially to change this panorama in Brazil.</jats:p	['SDG15']

The trade in illegal timber and wood products creates market disadvantages for products from sustainable forestry. Although various measures have been established to counter illegal logging and the subsequent trade, there is a lack of practical mechanisms for identifying the origin of timber and wood products. In this study, six nuclear microsatellites were used to generate DNA fingerprints for a genetic reference database characterising the populations of origin of a large set of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King, Meliaceae) samples. For the database, leaves and/or cambium from 1971 mahogany trees sampled in 31 stands from Mexico to Bolivia were genotyped. A total of 145 different alleles were found, showing strong genetic differentiation (δGregorious = 0.52, FST = 0.18, GST(Hedrick) = 0.65) and clear correlation between genetic and spatial distances among stands (r = 0.82, P &lt; 0.05). We used the genetic reference database and Bayesian assignment testing to determine the geographic origins of two sets of mahogany wood samples, based on their multilocus genotypes. In both cases the wood samples were assigned to the correct country of origin. We discuss the overall applicability of this methodology to tropical timber trading. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd	['SDG15']
10.1073/pnas.1213199109	Estimating divergence times in large molecular phylogenies	Molecular dating of species divergences has become an important means to add a temporal dimension to the Tree of Life. Increasingly larger datasets encompassing greater taxonomic diversity are becoming available to generate molecular timetrees by using sophisticated methods that model rate variation among lineages. However, the practical application of these methods is challenging because of the exorbitant calculation times required by current methods for contemporary data sizes, the difficulty in correctly modeling the rate heterogeneity in highly diverse taxonomic groups, and the lack of reliable clock calibrations and their uncertainty distributions for most groups of species. Here, we present a method that estimates relative times of divergences for all branching points (nodes) in very large phylogenetic trees without assuming a specific model for lineage rate variation or specifying any clock calibrations. The method (RelTime) performed better than existing methods when applied to very large computer simulated datasets where evolutionary rates were varied extensively among lineages by following autocorrelated and uncorrelated models. On average, RelTime completed calculations 1,000 times faster than the fastest Bayesian method, with even greater speed difference for larger number of sequences. This speed and accuracy will enable molecular dating analysis of very large datasets. Relative time estimates will be useful for determining the relative ordering and spacing of speciation events, identifying lineages with significantly slower or faster evolutionary rates, diagnosing the effect of selected calibrations on absolute divergence times, and estimating absolute times of divergence when highly reliable calibration points are available	['SDG15']

Less attention has been given to mapping and analysing the emergence of policy responses. This paper contributes to that process. It summarises emerging policy development on nutrition and sustainability, and explores difficulties in their integration. The paper describes some policy thinking at national, European and international levels of governance. It points to the existence of particular policy hotspots such as meat and dairy, sustainable diets and waste. Understanding the environmental impact of food systems challenges nutrition science to draw upon traditions of thinking which have recently been fragmented. These perspectives (life sciences, social and environmental) are all required if policy engagement and clarification is to occur. Sustainability issues offer opportunities for nutrition science and scientists to play a more central role in the policy analysis of future food systems. The task of revising current nutrition policy advice to become sustainable diet advice needs to begin at national and international levels.</jats:p	['SDG15']
10.1017/s0376892912000227	Comparative assessment of different methods for using land-cover variables for distribution modelling of Salamandra salamandra longirotris	SUMMARYPredictive models are frequently used to define the most suitable areas for species protection or reintroduction. Land-cover variables can be used in different ways for distribution modelling. The surface area of a set of land-cover classes is often used, each land-cover presence/absence or the distance to them from any point of the study area can be preferred; multiple types of land-cover variables may be combined to produce a single model. This paper assesses whether different approaches to using land-cover variables may lead to different ecological conclusions when interpreted for conservation by focusing on the distribution of the salamader Salamandra salamandra longirostris, an endangered amphibian subspecies in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Twenty-eight land-cover classes and another 42 environmental variables were used to construct four different models. Three models used a unique type of land-cover variable: either the presence of each class, the surface area of each class or the distance to each class, with all three variable types jointly entered in a fourth model. All models attained acceptable scores according to some criteria (discrimination, descriptive and predictive capacities, classification accuracy and parsimony); however most of the assessment parameters computed indicated a better performance of the models using either the surface area of land classes or the distance to them from every sampled square, compared to the model using class presences. The best scores were obtained with the fourth model, which combined different types of land-cover variables. This model suggested that oak forest fragmentation in favour of herbaceous crops and pastures may have negative effects on the distribution of S. s. longirostris. This was only partially suggested by the first three models, which considered a single type of land-cover variable, demonstrating the importance of considering a multi-variable analysis for conservation planning.</jats:p	['SDG15']

Foram realizadas entrevistas presenciais com aplicação de questionário especifico registrando as espécies vegetais de uso medicinal e dados sócio-econômicos dos moradores em 132 quintais urbanos de Rio Branco entre 2009 e 2010. Os bairros selecionados para o estudo foram: Aeroporto Velho, Placas, e Novo Horizonte, todos situados na periferia do município. Foram detectadas 83 espécies vegetais de uso medicinal pertencente a 50 famílias botânicas com destaque para Lamiaceae (12,0%) e Asteraceae (6,0%), sendo 66,2% exóticas, e 28,9% e 16,8%, associadas ao uso alimentar e ornamental, respectivamente. A decocção das folhas visando à obtenção do chá foi o principal modo de preparo das plantas. A análise de regressão logística entre a riqueza de espécies e diversos fatores socioeconômicos dos entrevistados mostrou que a probabilidade de ocorrência de espécies é três vezes maior em quintais manejados por moradores com idade superior a 50 anos de idade. A análise de correlação não paramétrica de fatores quantitativos mostrou que a variável tempo de moradia está mais correlacionada com a riqueza de plantas medicinais do que a variável idade.

10.4039/tce.2013.9	Freezing cold yet diverse: Dissecting a high-Arctic parasitoid community associated with Lepidoptera hosts	AbstractDespite increasing worldwide interest in host–parasitoid food webs, the parasitoid communities of the high Arctic remain poorly explored. To allow analyses of global patterns, and to detect the effects of ongoing climate change, such data are urgently needed. In this paper, we describe a systematic effort to characterise the high-Arctic Hymenoptera and Diptera parasitoid community associated with Lepidoptera hosts of the Zackenberg Valley (74°30′N, 21°00′W), northeast Greenland. Here, we first sampled adult parasitoids by a combination of Malaise traps, pitfall traps, and, less extensively, yellow pan traps and sweep netting. We then identified the host use of individual parasitoid taxa by rearing a large number of host individuals and species across multiple years. We now describe our preliminary findings on the species diversity of the target community, on trophic links between hosts and parasitoids, and on the sampling effort and techniques needed to characterise the community. We report on 30 local parasitoid taxa representing four families, three of which are species new to Greenland. In describing the community, we make a specific effort to summarise what is known about the taxonomy, phenology, and host use of the component species, to the benefit of future research in the area.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1111/1365-2664.12093	Mapping ecosystem service and biodiversity changes over 70 years in a rural English county	1. Biodiversity and ecosystem services continue to be compromised by land-use change, which is often focussed on enhancing agricultural production. Assessment of losses would be aided by analyses of temporal changes in the extent and spatial pattern of services and biodiversity. To date, no studies have mapped long-term changes in ecosystem services using historical maps. 2. We mapped changes between the 1930s – before the considerable intensification of land use in the UK starting in the 1940s – and 2000 in climate change amelioration services (carbon storage), provisioning services (agriculture and forestry) and plant species richness (biodiversity) for Dorset, a rural English county.3. We combined land-use maps (1-ha resolution) with multiple proxies of service delivery for the 10 different Broad Habitats in the region. Biodiversity was mapped using plant survey data from the two time periods. We used bootstrapping to include uncertainty due to the different proxies and Gini coefficients to quantify statistical changes in spatial pattern. 4. Overall, we found significant increases in agricultural provisioning and large losses in biodiversity over the period, which reflect widespread conversion and intensification of land use. We found no change in Dorset’s carbon store, because carbon lost through land-use intensification was balanced by increases in woodland over the 20th century. 5. The carbon storage and the delivery of provisioning services both became more unequally distributed, indicating a change from relatively homogeneous delivery of services to concentration into hotspots. The maps from the year 2000 showed spatial dissociation of hotspots for carbon, provisioning and biodiversity, which suggests that, compared to the 1930s, modern, intensive land use creates conflicts in delivery of multiple services and biodiversity. 6. Synthesis and applications. Detailed maps of historical changes in location-specific service delivery and biodiversity provide valuable information for land-use planning, highlight trade-offs and help to identify drivers. Furthermore, historical maps provide an important baseline to indicate the suitability and potential success of suggested actions, such as habitat restoration, and their relevance to traditional land use. Various frameworks could be informed by our approach, including the ecosystem service aims of the EU biodiversity strategy and the newly created UK Nature Improvement Areas	['SDG15']

However, there is still substantial uncertainty about its absolute rate. This study presents a harmonized comparison of field weathering rates estimated with the mechanistic model PROFILE and the depletion method for 16 intensively sampled soil profiles across Sweden representing different site conditions. In general, a correspondence in total weathering rates was found between the two methods except in rare cases where either method yielded deviating results. The weathering rate was higher according to the depletion method than according to PROFILE for Mg, while PROFILE produced higher weathering rates for the other base cations. The Spearman rank correlation (rho) between the two methods indicated significant correlation for Ca (rho = 0.44, p = 0.04) and non-significant correlation for Mg (rho = 0.51, p = 0.09), Na (rho = 0.25, p = 0.34), K (rho = 0.07, p = 0.80), and the sum of the base cations (rho = 0.11, p = 0.67). The variation in weathering rates with depth showed opposite gradients in the upper 50 cm, which reflects the conceptual differences between the methods. This study shows the potential of using multiple methods to identify a probable weathering rate, if harmonized input data are used. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of making comparisons for individual elements in order to interpret differences between methods. Regardless of the method used, weathering rates were below or at the same level as the losses caused by whole-tree harvesting, particularly in southern Sweden, indicating a risk of negative effects on soils and waters.

10.1071/cp13040	Habitat and plant diversity of Trifolium tumens (Steven ex M. Bieb.) collected in Azerbaijan and its characterisation and field evaluation in Tasmania, Australia	Trifolium tumens (Talish clover) is a perennial legume species not previously domesticated for use in world agriculture. It is native to areas of the eastern Mediterranean, Caucasus and mountainous areas of the Middle East with a warm temperate or cool Mediterranean environment. The species has been identified by pasture researchers in Australia as a having sufficient drought and grazing tolerance to fill a gap created by the lack of a well adapted perennial legume for dryland pasture systems across low rainfall (450 to 750 mm annual average rainfall), temperate regions of Australia. The need to expand available genetic diversity of this species resulted in a germplasm collecting mission to Azerbaijan in 2004. The successful mission collected seed from 35 populations of T. tumens across 7 agro ecological zones, including 5 climatic zones. This collection increased the number of accessions held in ex situ local and international collections from 21 to 56. The range of adaptation and frequency of the collection of T. tumens was far greater than expected with accessions found at altitudes ranging from 12 to 1700 m above sea level, in soils with pH (1:5 H20) ranging between 5.0 and 9.0 and rainfall varying from 300 to 1300 mm. T. tumens was found growing alongside a diverse range of companion species in heavily grazed lowland pastures up to lightly grazed alpine meadows. This material has been characterised by the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture (TIA), with promising accessions contributing to a breeding program to develop a commercial cultivar adapted to temperate environments (&lt;750 mm rainfall). </jats:p	['SDG15']

Moreover, we assessed the extent to which by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century such hotspots will be exposed to average monthly temperature and precipitation patterns which can be regarded as extreme if compared to the climate experienced during 1950-2000. In particular, we considered the entire European sub-continent plus Turkey and a total of 1149 species of terrestrial vertebrates. For each species, we developed species-specific expert-based distribution models (validated against field data) which we used to calculate species richness maps for mammals, breeding birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Considering four global circulation model outputs and three emission scenarios, we generated an index of risk of exposure to extreme climates, and we used a bivariate local Moran’s <i>I</i> to identify the areas with a significant association between hotspots of diversity and high risk of exposure to extreme climates. Our results outline that the Mediterranean basin represents both an important hotspot for biodiversity and especially for threatened species for all taxa. In particular, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas host particularly high species richness as measured over all groups, while the eastern Mediterranean basin is particularly rich in amphibians and reptiles; the islands (both Macaronesian and Mediterranean) host the highest richness of threatened species for all taxa occurs. Our results suggest that the main hotspots of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrates may be extensively influenced by the climate change projected to occur over the coming decades, especially in the Mediterranean bioregion, posing serious concerns for biodiversity conservation.</p> </div	['SDG15']

10.1163/15685381-00002868	Habitat use of the common spadefoot toad (pelobates fuscus) in Estonia	Habitat loss and degradation are the most obvious and acute factors which influence amphibian decline. Fortunately, however, habitat deterioration is potentially reversible. Recognizing the factors critical for the species is therefore essential for successful habitat restoration and maintenance. In this study we explored the habitat requirements of the common spadefoot toad (Pelobates fuscus), a severely declining species in Europe. The toad is considered a typical representative of herpetofauna in open agricultural landscapes but at its northern and western range edge the species occurs also in forested areas. So far, studies on the habitat requirements of the common spadefoot toad have only focused on agricultural areas and the significance of forest habitats has remained indistinct. In order to determine the habitat characteristics vital for the species as well as the function of forests as possible sink or source habitats, we explored 34 water bodies and their surroundings comparatively in forested and open landscapes in Estonia. Our study demonstrated that land cover type did not influence the presence of the species – the limiting habitat factors were related to soil type and quality of the reproduction site only. Respectively, the species preferred large fish free sun exposed water bodies in areas with sandy soil. In our study sites such conditions were best met in old growth coniferous forest areas. Thus we suggest that these types of forests holding viable populations of the common spadefoot toad should be protected with large scale clear cuttings as well as altering of hydrology avoided.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.015	Function of small habitat elements for enhancing plant diversity in different agricultural landscapes	The extensive transformation of agricultural landscapes worldwide has led to a decrease in grassland species related to traditional low-intensive farming. To properly manage and protect species, habitats and ecosystems in any of these landscapes requires a better understanding of direct and indirect effects of the processes driving biodiversity decline. In this study, we investigated how small habitat elements, represented by mid-field islets and road verges, in different types of agricultural landscapes can sustain a regional species pool for plant diversity otherwise associated to semi-natural grasslands. Although semi-natural grasslands had higher total and specialist richness, we found that small habitat elements harboured relatively high plant species richness, especially in a landscape with many semi-natural grasslands left. In the most intensively managed landscape, total richness declined as distance to the nearest semi-natural grassland increased. In contrast, beta-diversity was highest in these landscapes indicating that small habitats are also negatively affected by distance to grassland. We found that species trait composition varied depending on habitat and landscape. The results confirm that fragmentation shape trait composition within plant communities, e.g. plant size, clonality, longevity, and dispersal traits. We conclude that small habitat elements increase the total area available to grassland species present in the landscape, boosting the spatio-temporal dynamics of grassland communities. Small habitat elements may hence function as refugia or stepping stone habitats, especially in intensively utilized agricultural landscapes, and should be regarded as a functional part of a semi-natural grassland network, analogous to a meta-population.</p	['SDG15']

10.1111/jbi.12233	Drivers of tree diversity in tropical rain forests: New insights from a comparison between littoral and hilly landscapes of Central Africa	Aim: Our aim was to document African rain forest tree diversity patterns to test whether they support one of the following hypotheses: the structure of tree species diversity is at equilibrium and mostly driven by neutral processes (H0); the structure of tree species diversity results from Pleistocene forest cover dynamics (H1); or the structure of tree species diversity results from ecological sorting along environmental gradients (H2). Location: West Central Africa: the hilly region of Gabon, a putative Pleistocene forest refuge, and the adjacent flat littoral region, putatively colonized by forests from the hilly region after the last glaciation. Methods: We used 103 standardized 0.1-ha tree plots distributed among five landscapes in the two regions. We partitioned the tree diversity within and among plots at a local and regional scale using the Hurlbert effective number of species framework. The explanatory power of geographical and elevational distances on species turnover was tested. At the landscape scale, we partitioned the beta diversity into nestedness and turnover components. Results: Mean alpha and gamma diversities were much higher in the hilly region, where differences in elevation explained a significant part of species turnover. Substantial species turnover correlated with geographical distance also occurred in the littoral region despite its low elevational heterogeneity. Floristic turnover between plots from different regions remained stable whatever the elevational/geographical distances. At the regional scale, species replacement remained the main contributor to beta diversity (low nestedness values). Main conclusions: The heterogeneous distribution of alpha and gamma diversity, similar levels of species turnover among plots and the low contribution of the nestedness component to beta diversity between hilly and littoral landscapes do not support hypotheses H0 and H1. The combined impacts of limited dispersal and ecological sorting along environmental gradients (H2) can explain patterns within regions. The marked floristic discontinuity between regions could reflect contrasting histories (two distinct refugia) although the role of contrasting environments cannot be discounted.

10.1155/2014/896453	Integrated monitoring and assessment framework of regional ecosystem under the global climate change background	Global changes are driving ecosystem alterations, and the effects are becoming more and more obvious. Ecosystem management clarifies the fundamental supporting functions of ecosystems for human survival and sustainable development. Integrated ecosystem monitoring and assessment has become a popular topic of ecology study. However, many scientific questions need to be addressed, including what assessment contents and methods are optimal for temporal and spatial measurements. Therefore, the development of a scientific evaluation framework that includes certain core contents and indicators is very important. This paper proposes a regional integrated ecosystem assessment framework involving comprehensive monitoring. Satellite images are the main data source for different ecosystem and ecological parameters, and these need to be supplemented with the help of surveys or field observation data. A healthy ecosystem is the basis of human survival and sustainable development, and ecological service should be taken as the core of integrated ecosystem assessment. This is decided by the spatial distribution, classification, and patterns of regional ecosystems. That is to say, ecological service, together with ecosystems distribution and pattern, ecological problem indicators, and ecological stress, needs to be integrated analyzed and evaluated	['SDG15']

A preference for nesting in the Northern Mistbelt Forest vegetation type was established and 82% of all nests were located in indigenous trees. Nest abandonment was less common when distances to the nearest neighbour were greater. The diet of this species was investigated by examination of prey remains beneath nests and verified by comparison with museum specimens. In total, 156 remains were found, representing a minimum of 75 prey individuals. The diet of African Crowned Eagles constituted almost entirely mammals (99%), which were predominantly antelopes (61%) and monkeys (25%). It was also found that the proportion of primates in the diet correlates with latitude: populations in equatorial latitudes have a higher proportion of primates in their diets, whereas further south antelopes are a much more common diet component	['SDG15']

We analyzed the effects of landscape composition (amount of surrounding forest cover) and farm management (conventional vs. organic) on the diversity and structure of woody plant species assemblages in Costa Rican coffee agroforestry systems. We utilized information from a GIS land-use database, surveys of 1-ha plots located in 14 coffee farms and 4 forest fragments, and farmer interviews on management practices. The coffee farms harbored over 100 tree species, including 19% of the native tree species found in the surrounding forests. The majority of tree species on the farms were native (82%) to the study area and originated from natural regeneration (73%). Among the tree species that regenerated naturally, 71% were dispersed by animals. On the other hand more than half of the individuals were non-natives (55%) and originated from planting, which resulted in low species similarity between farms and forests and a low density for most native species on the farms. Forest cover within a 1000 m radius around the farms varied between 4 and 38%. Increasing forest cover around the farms had a significant, positive effect on species richness; especially on tree species dispersed by animals, and on species similarity between farms and forests. This suggests that the connection to natural forests increases seed dispersal into adjacent farms. The number of regenerated species was higher on the organic farms, but tree species richness was not affected by management type. Although species assemblages on the coffee farms are strongly determined by natural regeneration, the number of individuals contributed by these processes is low. Tree species conservation in agricultural landscapes would greatly benefit from protecting remnant forests, from facilitating natural regeneration processes and promoting native trees on farms, with particular attention to rare species.The School for Field Studies/[]/SFS/Costa RicaUCR::Vicerrectoría de Docencia::Ciencias Básicas::Facultad de Ciencias::Escuela de Biologí	['SDG15']
10.1016/j.agee.2014.09.002	Shade tree diversity, carbon sequestration, and epiphyte presence in coffee agroecosystems: A decade of smallholder management in San Ramón, Nicaragua	Coffee smallholder management practices have received attention for their potential to conserve biodiversity and sequester carbon by maintaining structural complexity, high canopy diversity, and minimal external inputs. We conducted shade tree surveys on 95 1000 m2 research plots over a 10-year period to identify patterns of shade tree density and diversity, epiphyte presence, and carbon stocks within smallholder shade coffee systems of northern Nicaragua. We also analyzed each of these parameters with respect to management by comparing collectively- and individually-managed farms. Our results indicate that the overall shade tree density has decreased over time (F = 42.597, p \u3c 0.001), but that diversity remained constant. Carbon stocks in coffee systems also showed a decreasing trend over time (F = 2.981, p = 0.056), most likely due to the decreasing tree densities. Epiphytic plant presence increased over time despite decreased host tree densities, suggesting either a change in management or improved habitat conditions for epiphytes. Research plots on individually-managed coffee farms generally had higher shade tree densities than those on collectively managed farms (t = 2.141, p = 0.037), but we found no differences in shade tree species richness or carbon stocks (t = 0.573, p = 0.568). We conclude that smallholder coffee farmers continue to conserve both shade tree diversity and epiphyte communities	['SDG15']

10.1088/1748-9326/9/11/115004	Feed and manure use in low-N-input and high-N-input dairy cattle production systems	In most parts of Sub-Saharan Africa fertilizers and feeds are costly, not readily available and used sparingly in agricultural production. In many parts of Western Europe, North America, and Oceania fertilizers and feeds are relatively inexpensive, readily available and used abundantly to maximize profitable agricultural production. A case study, dairy systems approach was used to illustrate how differences in feed and manure management in a low-N-input dairy cattle system (Niger, West Africa) and a high-N-input dairy production system (Wisconsin, USA) impact agricultural production and environmental N loss. In Niger, an additional daily feed N intake of 114 g per dairy animal unit (AU, 1000 kg live weight) could increase annual milk production from 560 to 1320 kg AU ^−1 , and the additional manure N could greatly increase millet production. In Wisconsin, reductions in daily feed N intake of 100 g AU ^−1 would not greatly impact milk production but decrease urinary N excretion by 25% and ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions from manure by 18% to 30%. In Niger, compared to the practice of housing livestock and applying dung only onto fields, corralling cattle or sheep on cropland (to capture urinary N) increased millet yields by 25% to 95%. The additional millet grain due to dung applications or corralling would satisfy the annual food grain requirements of 2–5 persons; the additional forage would provide 120–300 more days of feed for a typical head of cattle; and 850 to 1600 kg ha ^−1 more biomass would be available for soil conservation. In Wisconsin, compared to application of barn manure only, corralling heifers in fields increased forage production by only 8% to 11%. The application of barn manure or corralling increased forage production by 20% to 70%. This additional forage would provide 350–580 more days of feed for a typical dairy heifer. Study results demonstrate how different approaches to feed and manure management in low-N-input and high-N-input dairy cattle systems impact milk production, manure N excretion, manure N capture, N recycling and environmental N loss	['SDG15']

10.1111/eva.12214	Hybridization facilitates evolutionary rescue	The resilience of populations to rapid environmental degradation is a major concern for biodiversity conservation. When environments deteriorate to lethal levels, species must evolve to adapt to the new conditions to avoid extinction. Here, we test the hypothesis that evolutionary rescue may be enabled by hybridization, because hybridization increases genetic variability. Using experimental evolution, we show that interspecific hybrid populations of Saccharomyces yeast adapt to grow in more highly degraded environments than intraspecific and parental crosses, resulting in survival rates far exceeding those of their ancestors. We conclude that hybridization can increase evolutionary responsiveness and that taxa able to exchange genes with distant relatives may better survive rapid environmental change	['SDG15']

We conducted transect surveys in central Nuristan and confirmed the presence of musk deer Moschus cupreus &gt; 60 years after the last documented observation of the species in Afghanistan. We found that, in summer, musk deer inhabit remote alpine scrub on scattered rock outcrops and in upper fringes of closed coniferous forests at c. 3,000–3,500 m. They invariably use steep slopes (≥ 20°), which makes them difficult to approach. We built a data-driven geographical model, which predicted that suitable habitat for musk deer in Afghanistan extends over c. 1,300 km2 in the contiguous provinces of Nuristan (75.5%), Kunar (14.4%) and Laghman (10.1%). Although relatively vast, the area of habitat potentially available to musk deer in Afghanistan appears to be highly fragmented. Despite indications of unsustainable hunting, this Endangered species persists in Afghanistan and targeted conservation programmes are required to protect it and its forest habitat.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.5194/bg-11-6633-2014	Pasture degradation modifies the water and carbon cycles of the Tibetan highlands	The Tibetan Plateau has a significant role with regard to atmospheric circulation and the monsoon in particular. Changes between a closed plant cover and open bare soil are one of the striking effects of land use degradation observed with unsustainable range management or climate change, but experiments investigating changes of surface properties and processes together with atmospheric feedbacks are rare and have not been undertaken in the world's two largest alpine ecosystems, the alpine steppe and the Kobresia pygmaea pastures of the Tibetan Plateau. We connected measurements of micro-lysimeter, chamber, 13C labelling, and eddy covariance and combined the observations with land surface and atmospheric models, adapted to the highland conditions. This allowed us to analyse how three degradation stages affect the water and carbon cycle of pastures on the landscape scale within the core region of the Kobresia pygmaea ecosystem. The study revealed that increasing degradation of the Kobresia turf affects carbon allocation and strongly reduces the carbon uptake, compromising the function of Kobresia pastures as a carbon sink. Pasture degradation leads to a shift from transpiration to evaporation while a change in the sum of evapotranspiration over a longer period cannot be confirmed. The results show an earlier onset of convection and cloud generation, likely triggered by a shift in evapotranspiration timing when dominated by evaporation. Consequently, precipitation starts earlier and clouds decrease the incoming solar radiation. In summary, the changes in surface properties by pasture degradation found on the highland have a significant influence on larger scales	['SDG15']

10.1128/aem.00038-15	Site history and edaphic features override the influence of plant species on microbial communities in restored tidal freshwater wetlands	ABSTRACT                        Restored wetland soils differ significantly in physical and chemical properties from their natural counterparts even when plant community compositions are similar, but effects of restoration on microbial community composition and function are not well understood. Here, we investigate plant-microbe relationships in restored and natural tidal freshwater wetlands from two subestuaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Soil samples were collected from the root zone of             Typha latifolia             ,             Phragmites australis             ,             Peltandra virginica             , and             Lythrum salicaria             . Soil microbial composition was assessed using 454 pyrosequencing, and genes representing bacteria, archaea, denitrification, methanogenesis, and methane oxidation were quantified. Our analysis revealed variation in some functional gene copy numbers between plant species within sites, but intersite comparisons did not reveal consistent plant-microbe trends. We observed more microbial variations between plant species in natural wetlands, where plants have been established for a long period of time. In the largest natural wetland site, sequences putatively matching methanogens accounted for ∼17% of all sequences, and the same wetland had the highest numbers of genes coding for methane coenzyme A reductase (             mcrA             ). Sequences putatively matching aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) were detected in all sites, suggesting that both aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation are possible in these systems. Our data suggest that site history and edaphic features override the influence of plant species on microbial communities in restored wetlands.           </jats:p	['SDG15']
10.2166/wp.2014.129	Closing the (widening) gap between natural water resources and water needs in the Jordan River Basin: A long-term perspective	The supply of renewable natural water available in a sustainable fashion in the Jordan River Basin, comprising Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, will soon drop below 100 m3/person/year. Drawing on recent technological progress and policy innovations, a comprehensive policy to address the region's water problems in the long run is offered. The policy has a dual goal: to satisfy the needs of a growing population (domestic, irrigation and industry) and to preserve important environmental amenities, including restoration of the Lower Jordan River and stabilization of the Dead Sea level. The gap between natural water supplies and the basic needs of the growing population will be closed by conservation and desalination; at the same time, all domestic water will be recycled and will be available for reuse in irrigation and environmental restoration. Over time the supply of recycled water that should be allocated for environmental restoration (accounting for the compensation of irrigators) will suffice to partially restore the Lower Jordan River and contribute to the stabilization of the Dead Sea. The analysis is relevant in a wide range of real-world situations, where satisfying the basic needs of a growing population and preserving environmental amenities become critical.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1017/s0030605314000969	Opportunistic behaviour or desperate measure? Logging impacts may only partially explain terrestriality in the Bornean orang-utan Pongo pygmaeus morio	AbstractThere is a lack of information on how the Endangered Bornean orang-utan Pongo pygmaeus morio moves through its environment. Here we report on a camera-trapping study carried out over 2.5 years to investigate the orang-utan's terrestrial behaviour in Wehea Forest, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. We set 41 camera trap stations in an area of secondary forest, 36 in recently logged forest immediately adjacent to Wehea Forest, and 20 in an area of primary forest in the heart of Wehea Forest. A combined sampling effort of 28,485 trap nights yielded 296 independent captures of orang-utans. Of the three study sites, orang-utans were most terrestrial in recently logged forest, which may be only partially explained by breaks in the canopy as a result of logging activity. However, orang-utans were also terrestrial in primary forest, where there was a closed canopy and ample opportunity for moving through the trees. Our results indicate that orang-utans may be more terrestrial than previously thought and demonstrate opportunistic behaviour when moving through their environment, including using newly constructed logging roads for locomotion, possibly indicating some degree of resilience to human disturbance. This finding is important because of the potential role of sustainably logged forests for orang-utan conservation.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1080/17508975.2014.970121	Human factors in the design of sustainable built environments	Scientific research provides convincing evidence that climate change is having significant impacts on many aspects of life. In the built-environment domain, regulatory requirements are pushing the challenges of environmental, economic, and social sustainability at the core of the professional agenda, although the aims of carbon reduction and energy conservation are frequently given a priority over occupants' comfort, well-being, and satisfaction. While most practitioners declare to embrace sustainability as a driver of their professional approach, a general lack of integrated creative and technical skills hinders the design of buildings centred on articulate and comprehensive sustainability goals, encompassing, other than energy criteria, also human-centred and ethical values founded on competent and informed consideration of the requirements of the site, the programme, and the occupants. Built environments are designed by humans to host a range of human activities. In response, this article aims to endorse a sustainable approach to design founded on the knowledge arising from scholarly and evidence-based research, exploring principles and criteria for the creation and operation of human habitats that can respond to energy and legislative demands, mitigate their environmental impacts, and adapt to new climate scenarios, while elevating the quality of experience and delight to those occupying them	['SDG15']

10.1556/0088.2015.64.1.4	Long-term effect of organic and mineral fertilization on the stability of soil aggregates on a brown forest soil	A talajok aggregátum-stabilitásának ismerete kulcsfontosságú a talajtermékenység fenntartásának és növelésének hatékony kivitelezése, valamint a talajok védelme szempontjából.         A talajaggregátumok kialakulása és végső soron a stabilitása is jórészt a szerves anyagok mennyiségének és minőségének függvénye. Találunk közöttük állandó, cementáló jellegű anyagokat, ill. átmeneti jellegű kötőanyagokat is. Mivel a talajok különböző mértékben tartalmazzák ezen anyagokat, és azok különböző ideig hatnak az aggregátumok szerkezetének stabilitására, indokolt lehet különböző szervesanyag-kiegészítésű hosszú távú tartamkísérletek mintázása az aggregátum-stabilitás értékek meghatározására.A tartamkísérletek bázisán már korábban is végeztünk a talaj agronómiai szerkezetére és szerkezeti stabilitásra irányuló vizsgálatokat. Ezekre alapozottan új tartamkísérleti parcellák vizsgálatával folytattuk aggregátum stabilitás vizsgálatainkat a növekvő adagú műtrágyázás és a különböző formájú szerves anyag visszapótlású kezelésekben.         Vizsgálatainkban a vízálló aggregátumok százalékos arányát határoztuk meg (Water-stable aggregates, WSA) egy Eijkelkamp (Hollandia) nedves szita segítségével. Vizsgálatainkhoz az 1–2 mm közötti talajfrakciót használtuk. A méréseket 250 mikronos szitákon végeztük.         A mintavétel után két héttel végzett vizsgálatok eredményeiből megállapítottuk, hogy a szervestrágya-kiegészítések közül a szár+zöldtrágya leszántás adta a legnagyobb stabilitás értéket. A N-adagok közül pedig a 140 kg·ha−1 kezelésben mértük a legnagyobb értéket. Utóbbi szignifikánsan nagyobbnak bizonyult minden más N-kezelésénél. A kombinációs hatások vizsgálatánál a szárleszántásos változat 140 kg·ha−1-os nitrogénadag melletti stabilitás értéke több mint kétszerese volt a nem szervestrágya-kiegészítésű kontroll N-parcellákénak.         A mintavétel után három hónappal végzett stabilitásvizsgálat eredményei alap-ján a trágyázási változatok makroaggregátum-stabilitás értékei kiegyenlítődtek. Az N-adagok hatását vizsgálva azonban a korábban legnagyobb stabilitású 140 kg·ha−1-os N-kezelés adta a legkisebb értéket. A két időpont eredményeit összehasonlítva megállapítható, hogy a stabilitás értékek minden trágyázási változatban és a 140·kg ha−1-os N-adag kivételével minden N-kezelésben jelentősen növekedtek.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1073/pnas.1502545112	Combining paleo-data and modern exclosure experiments to assess the impact of megafauna extinctions on woody vegetation	Until recently in Earth history, very large herbivores (mammoths, ground sloths, diprotodons, and many others) occurred in most of the World's terrestrial ecosystems, but the majority have gone extinct as part of the late-Quaternary extinctions. How has this large-scale removal of large herbivores affected landscape structure and ecosystem functioning? In this review, we combine paleo-data with information from modern exclosure experiments to assess the impact of large herbivores (and their disappearance) on woody species, landscape structure, and ecosystem functions. In modern landscapes characterized by intense herbivory, woody plants can persist by defending themselves or by association with defended species, can persist by growing in places that are physically inaccessible to herbivores, or can persist where high predator activity limits foraging by herbivores. At the landscape scale, different herbivore densities and assemblages may result in dynamic gradients in woody cover. The late-Quaternary extinctions were natural experiments in large-herbivore removal; the paleoecological record shows evidence of widespread changes in community composition and ecosystem structure and function, consistent with modern exclosure experiments. We propose a conceptual framework that describes the impact of large herbivores on woody plant abundance mediated by herbivore diversity and density, predicting that herbivore suppression of woody plants is strongest where herbivore diversity is high. We conclude that the decline of large herbivores induces major alterations in landscape structure and ecosystem functions	['SDG15']
10.1007/s11258-016-0565-1	Effects of road type and urbanization on the diversity and abundance of alien species in roadside verges in Western Siberia	The spread of alien plant species by vehicles profoundly affects the roadside vegetation. Roads with high traffic densities in urban regions may facilitate the invasion of alien plants. The present study examined the effects of road type and distance to the city centre on native and alien plant species in both the aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank of road verges in originally dry steppe grasslands in the surroundings of Pavlodar, Western Siberia, Kazakhstan. This region is characterized by a recent change of land use and rapidly expanding urbanization. Vegetation surveys were conducted at 12 sites in equal numbers distributed along roads with different traffic densities (national and local roads) and at two distances to the city centre (city edge and rural surroundings). The seedling-emergency method was used to examine the soil seed bank at each site. We found a larger proportion of alien species along national roads (42% in the aboveground vegetation, 57% in the soil seed bank) than along local roads (20% and 44%, respectively), which can be explained by differences in traffic density, origin of vehicles and habitat conditions. More alien species were found in road verges at the city edge than in the rural surroundings along both road types, probably due to the spread of propagules from residential areas. Our study demonstrates that national roads are important pathways for the introduction of alien species in this Western Siberian region	['SDG15']

10.1038/ismej.2016.10	Protistan community analysis: Key findings of a large-scale molecular sampling	Protists are perhaps the most lineage-rich of microbial lifeforms, but remain largely unknown. High-throughput sequencing technologies provide opportunities to screen whole habitats in depth and enable detailed comparisons of different habitats to measure, compare and map protistan diversity. Such comparisons are often limited by low sample numbers within single studies and a lack of standardisation between studies. Here, we analysed 232 samples from 10 sampling campaigns using a standardised PCR protocol and bioinformatics pipeline. We show that protistan community patterns are highly consistent within habitat types and geographic regions, provided that sample processing is standardised. Community profiles are only weakly affected by fluctuations of the abundances of the most abundant taxa and, therefore, provide a sound basis for habitat comparison beyond random short-term fluctuations in the community composition. Further, we provide evidence that distribution patterns are not solely resulting from random processes. Distinct habitat types and distinct taxonomic groups are dominated by taxa with distinct distribution patterns that reflect their ecology with respect to dispersal and habitat colonisation. However, there is no systematic shift of the distribution pattern with taxon abundance.ISSN:1751-7362ISSN:1751-737	['SDG15']

Forest concepts and definitions in the era of forest and landscape restoration	We present a historical overview of forest concepts and definitions, linking these changes with distinct perspectives and management objectives. Policies dealing with a broad range of forest issues are often based on definitions created for the purpose of assessing global forest stocks, which do not distinguish between natural and planted forests or reforests, and which have not proved useful in assessing national and global rates of forest regrowth and restoration. Implementing and monitoring forest and landscape restoration requires additional approaches to defining and assessing forests that reveal the qualities and trajectories of forest patches in a spatially and temporally dynamic landscape matrix. New technologies and participatory assessment of forest states and trajectories offer the potential to operationalize such definitions. Purpose-built and contextualized definitions are needed to support policies that successfully protect, sustain, and regrow forests at national and global scales. We provide a framework to illustrate how different management objectives drive the relative importance of different aspects of forest state, dynamics, and landscape context. © 2016, The Author(s)	['SDG15']

10.1186/s12862-016-0631-2	The plasmid-mediated evolution of the mycobacterial ESX (Type VII) secretion systems	BACKGROUND: The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains five copies of the ESX gene cluster, each encoding a dedicated protein secretion system. These ESX secretion systems have been defined as a novel Type VII secretion machinery, responsible for the secretion of proteins across the characteristic outer mycomembrane of the mycobacteria. Some of these secretion systems are involved in virulence and survival in M. tuberculosis; however they are also present in other non-pathogenic mycobacteria, and have been identified in some non-mycobacterial actinomycetes. Three components of the ESX gene cluster have also been found clustered in some gram positive monoderm organisms and are predicted to have preceded the ESX gene cluster. RESULTS: This study used in silico and phylogenetic analyses to describe the evolution of the ESX gene cluster from the WXG-FtsK cluster of monoderm bacteria to the five ESX clusters present in M. tuberculosis and other slow-growing mycobacteria. The ancestral gene cluster, ESX-4, was identified in several nonmycomembrane producing actinobacteria as well as the mycomembrane-containing Corynebacteriales in which the ESX cluster began to evolve and diversify. A novel ESX gene cluster, ESX-4(EVOL), was identified in some non-mycobacterial actinomycetes and M. abscessus subsp. bolletii. ESX-4(EVOL) contains all of the conserved components of the ESX gene cluster and appears to be a precursor of the mycobacterial ESX duplications. Between two and seven ESX gene clusters were identified in each mycobacterial species, with ESX-2 and ESX-5 specifically associated with the slow growers. The order of ESX duplication in the mycobacteria is redefined as ESX-4, ESX-3, ESX-1 and then ESX-2 and ESX-5. Plasmid-encoded precursor ESX gene clusters were identified for each of the genomic ESX-3, -1, -2 and -5 gene clusters, suggesting a novel plasmid-mediated mechanism of ESX duplication and evolution. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of the various ESX gene clusters on vital biological and virulence-related functions has clearly influenced the diversification and success of the various mycobacterial species, and their evolution from the non-pathogenic fast-growing saprophytic to the slow-growing pathogenic organisms.

10.1017/s0031182016000536	The diversity-disease relationship: Evidence for and criticisms of the dilution effect	SUMMARYThe dilution effect, that high host species diversity can reduce disease risk, has attracted much attention in the context of global biodiversity decline and increasing disease emergence. Recent studies have criticized the generality of the dilution effect and argued that it only occurs under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, evidence for the existence of a dilution effect was reported in about 80% of the studies that addressed the diversity–disease relationship, and a recent meta-analysis found that the dilution effect is widespread. We here review supporting and critical studies, point out the causes underlying the current disputes. The dilution is expected to be strong when the competent host species tend to remain when species diversity declines, characterized as a negative relationship between species’ reservoir competence and local extinction risk. We here conclude that most studies support a negative competence–extinction relationship. We then synthesize the current knowledge on how the diversity–disease relationship can be modified by particular species in community, by the scales of analyses, and by the disease risk measures. We also highlight the complex role of habitat fragmentation in the diversity–disease relationship from epidemiological, evolutionary and ecological perspectives, and construct a synthetic framework integrating these three perspectives. We suggest that future studies should test the diversity–disease relationship across different scales and consider the multiple effects of landscape fragmentation.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.7717/peerj.1694	Broad-scale sampling of primary freshwater fish populations reveals the role of intrinsic traits, inter-basin connectivity, drainage area and latitude on shaping contemporary patterns of genetic diversity	Background.Worldwide predictions suggest that up to 75% of the freshwater fish species occurring in rivers with reduced discharge could be extinct by 2070 due to the combined effect of climate change and water abstraction. The Mediterranean region is considered to be a hotspot of freshwater fish diversity but also one of the regions where the effects of climate change will be more severe. Iberian cyprinids are currently highly endangered, with over 68% of the species raising some level of conservation concern.Methods.During the FISHATLAS project, the Portuguese hydrographical network was extensively covered (all the 34 river basins and 47 sub-basins) in order to contribute with valuable data on the genetic diversity distribution patterns of native cyprinid species. A total of 188 populations belonging to 16 cyprinid species ofSqualius, Luciobarbus, Achondrostoma, Iberochondrostoma, AnaecyprisandPseudochondrostomawere characterized, for a total of 3,678 cytochromebgene sequences.Results.When the genetic diversity of these populations was mapped, it highlighted differences among populations from the same species and between species with identical distribution areas. Factors shaping the contemporary patterns of genetic diversity were explored and the results revealed the role of latitude, inter-basin connectivity, migratory behaviour, species maximum size, species range and other species intrinsic traits in determining the genetic diversity of sampled populations. Contrastingly, drainage area and hydrological regime (permanent vs. temporary) seem to have no significant effect on genetic diversity. Species intrinsic traits, maximum size attained, inter-basin connectivity and latitude explained over 30% of the haplotype diversity variance and, generally, the levels of diversity were significantly higher for smaller sized species, from connected and southerly river basins.Discussion.Targeting multiple co-distributed species of primary freshwater fish allowed us to assess the relative role of historicalversuscontemporary factors affecting genetic diversity. Since different patterns were detected for species with identical distribution areas we postulate that contemporary determinants of genetic diversity (species’ intrinsic traits and landscape features) must have played a more significant role than historical factors. Implications for conservation in a context of climate change and highly disturbed habitats are detailed, namely the need to focus management and conservation actions on intraspecific genetic data and to frequently conduct combined genetic and demographic surveys.</jats:p	['SDG15']
10.1098/rstb.2015.0280	How does the functional diversity of frugivorous birds shape the spatial pattern of seed dispersal? A case study in a relict plant species	Genetic markers used in combination with network analysis can characterize the fine spatial pattern of seed dispersal and assess the differential contribution of dispersers. As a case study, we focus on the seed dispersal service provided by a small guild of frugivorous birds to the common yew,Taxus baccataL., in southern Spain. We build the spatial networks of seed dispersal events between trees and seed-plots within the studied population—local network—and the spatial network that includes all dispersal events—regional network. Such networks are structured in well-defined modules, i.e. groups of tightly connected mother trees and seed-plots. Neither geographical distance, nor microhabitat type explained this modular structure, but when long-distance dispersal events are incorporated in the network it shows a relative increase in overall modularity. Independent field observations suggested the co-occurrence of two complementary groups, short- and long-distance dispersers, mostly contributing to the local and regional seed rain, respectively. The main long-distance disperser at our site,Turdus viscivorus, preferentially visits the most productive trees, thus shaping the seed rain at the landscape scale and affecting the local modular organization. We end by discussing how DNA barcoding could serve to better quantify the role of functional diversity.</jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1007/s00572-016-0714-3	Soil drying procedure affects the DNA quantification of Lactarius vinosus but does not change the fungal community composition	Drying soil samples before DNA extraction is commonly used for specific fungal DNA quantification and metabarcoding studies, but the impact of different drying procedures on both the specific fungal DNA quantity and the fungal community composition has not been analyzed. We tested three different drying procedures (freeze-drying, oven-drying, and room temperature) on 12 different soil samples to determine (a) the soil mycelium biomass of the ectomycorrhizal species Lactarius vinosus using qPCR with a specifically designed TaqMan® probe and (b) the fungal community composition and diversity using the PacBio® RS II sequencing platform. Mycelium biomass of L. vinosus was significantly greater in the freeze-dried soil samples than in samples dried at oven and room temperature. However, drying procedures had no effect on fungal community composition or on fungal diversity. In addition, there were no significant differences in the proportions of fungi according to their functional roles (moulds vs. mycorrhizal species) in response to drying procedures. Only six out of 1139 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) had increased their relative proportions after soil drying at room temperature, with five of these OTUs classified as mould or yeast species. However, the magnitude of these changes was small, with an overall increase in relative abundance of these OTUs of approximately 2 %. These results suggest that DNA degradation may occur especially after drying soil samples at room temperature, but affecting equally nearly all fungi and therefore causing no significant differences in diversity and community composition. Despite the minimal effects caused by the drying procedures at the fungal community composition, freeze-drying resulted in higher concentrations of L. vinosus DNA and prevented potential colonization from opportunistic species.This work was supported by a STSM Grant from COST Action FP1203 and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity (MINECO) through the project AGL 2012-40035-C03.

10.1177/0256090920140104	Measuring Environmental Performance across a Green Supply Chain: A Managerial Overview of Environmental Indicators	The concept of green supply chains is now accepted in many corporate organizations in Asia. Since the early nineties, when industry became aware of the increasing relevance of sustainable development, many business enterprises in Asia have adopted environmental initiatives as an integral part of their business practices. In time these organizations came to realize that the environmental initiatives needed to encompass not only the organization's own business practices but also the entire stretch of operations across the supply chain. In other words, they felt the need to include the employees, suppliers, customers, waste handlers, and other business partners in the greening process (Bacallan, 2000). Thus, an integrated supply chain approach was called for. Such an approach should be able to identify the environmental aspects at every stage, assess the environmental impacts associated with these aspects, prioritize them, and design action plans to mitigate their adverse effects on the environment if any. An integrated green supply chain approach would take into consideration the inbound logistics phase of the supply chain, the production or internal supply chain, the outbound logistics phase, and the reverse logistics phase (Rao &amp; Holt, 2005; Sarkis, 1999; Seuring &amp; Muller, 2007). For many organizations in Asia, the green supply chain approach has also emerged as a way to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability (Seuring et al., 2008).  However, there is a continuous need to measure and monitor the extent to which environmental performance is actually achieved. To assess this performance, a system of indicators across the supply chain is proposed, which is computationally easy to implement at the industry level. To demonstrate that the system of environmental indicators does measure performance, an empirical approach is adopted to test whether the system correlates with the four constructs of environmental sustainability: resource conservation, energy efficiency, reduction of hazardous waste, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Vachon &amp; Mao, 2008).  In order to check these linkages of environmental indicators to the constituents of environmental performance, four multiple regression models were run. In the first model, the dependent variable was resource conservation, the independent predictor variables being the 20 environmental indicators grouped under the four constructs: Inbound logistics, production or internal logistics, outbound logistics, and reverse logistics. In the second, third, and fourth models, the dependent variables were energy efficiency, reduction of hazardous waste, and minimization of emission of greenhouse gases, respectively.  Upon running the regression models, the models for resource conservation, reduction of hazardous waste, and reduction of emission of greenhouse gases were found to be significant at 5 percent significance level while the model for energy efficiency was significant at 10 percent level. </jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1071/sr15123	Effects of controlled traffic no-till system on soil chemical properties and crop yield in annual double-cropping area of the North China Plain	A controlled traffic no-till system is a cropping system that has a significant potential to improve soil health, sustainability and crop yield. A pilot experiment was conducted to compare soil chemical properties and crop yields between controlled traffic no-till and random traffic in an annual double-cropping area of the North China Plain from 2005 to 2010. The experiment was performed using three treatments: (1) controlled traffic no-till (NTCT); (2) random traffic no-till (NTRT); and (3) conventional tillage (CT). The NTCT treatment significantly improved soil organic matter and total N compared with both NTRT and CT treatments and remarkably increased available P compared with CT treatment in the surface soil layer (0–10cm), but no significant differences were found in soil pH compared with both NTRT and CT treatments. However, in the 10–20- and 20–30-cm soil profiles, soil organic matter, total N and available P were reduced after NTCT treatment when compared with those obtained after CT treatment. At 0–10cm soil depths, soil bulk density under NTCT and NTRT was higher than in CT, whereas the opposite was true at soil depths of 10–30cm. Overall, it was found that the 6-year mean maize yield of NTCT and NTRT treatments was 10.9% and 1.1% higher respectively than the CT treatment, whereas the winter wheat yield was 1.1% and 3.0% higher respectively compared with the CT treatment. NTCT appears to be an improvement over current farming systems in an annual double-cropping area of the North China Plain. </jats:p	['SDG15']

10.1108/tqm-09-2014-0079	Model based integration of management systems (MSs)-case study	Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a case study regarding the deployment of a previously developed model for the integration of management systems (MSs). The case study is developed at a manufacturing site of an international enterprise. The implementation of this model in a real business environment is aimed at assessing its feasibility. Design/methodology/approach – The presented case study takes into account different management systems standards (MSSs) progressively implemented, along the years, independently. The implementation of the model was supported by the results obtained from an investigation performed according to a structured diagnosis that was conducted to collect information related to the organizational situation of the enterprise. Findings – The main findings are as follows: a robust integrated management system (IMS), objectively more lean, structured and manageable was found to be feasible; this study provided an holistic view of the enterprise’s global management; clarifications of job descriptions and boundaries of action and responsibilities were achieved; greater efficiency in the use of resources was attained; more coordinated management of the three pillars of sustainability – environmental, economic and social, as well as risks, providing confidence and added value to the company and interested parties was achieved. Originality/value – This case study is pioneering in Portugal in respect to the implementation, at the level of an industrial organization, of the model previously developed for the integration of individualized MSs. The case study provides new insights regarding the implementation of IMSs including the rationalization of several resources and elimination of several types of organizational waste leveraging gains of efficiency. Due to its intrinsic characteristics, the model is able to support, progressively, new or revised MSSs according to the principles of annex SL (normative) – proposals for MSSs – of the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission, that the industrial organization can adopt beyond the current ones.neste artigo faz-se uma compilação dos modelos adotados para a integração de sistemas de gestão.

Typical post-natural disaster reconstruction (PDR) projects are different from routine construction projects due to certain additional challenges. Understanding the wide range of individuals and groups that have direct or indirect stakes, interests and expectations from a PDR project is vital for its success. However, research on PDR with special emphasis on stakeholders and their significance in success and sustainability of the projects is limited. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) to amalgamate and synthesise research in this area. It focuses on the identification of the stakeholders and significance of their engagement in PDR activities for a more sustainable and resilient built environment. Research papers published in peer reviewed academic journals from 2000 to 2014 were identified through three major research databases, using T/A/K search options. The selected research papers were reviewed and critically analysed to identify the stakeholders and mechanism of their identification. This research revealed that contemporary research is unable to identify a commonly agreeable scientific method for identification of stakeholders and their interests. This research has outlined an exhaustive list of stakeholders that have been identified by the researchers. Based upon systematic review, this research has also provided background information, recent trends and a future direction for research in the specific field of stakeholder engagement in PDR projects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p"	['SDG15']

10.1016/j.actao.2016.09.004	Weed communities of rain-fed lowland rice vary with infestation by Rhamphicarpa fistulosa	The facultative hemiparasitic plant Rhamphicarpa fistulosa (Orobanchaceae) thrives in seasonally wet soils in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly in marginal lowland rice growing environments where weeds are already a major constraint for rice production. Because lowland rice production is increasing in tropical Africa, it is important to ascertain the influence of R. fistulosa on weed plant communities in these rice growing habitats. We investigated weed plant community richness and composition at four different levels of R. fistulosa infestation across two years of surveys from lowland rice fields in northern Togo (West Africa). Despite a lack of significant differences in community richness among sites with different R. fistulosa infestation levels, there were significant differences in community composition, both when estimated from presence-absence data and from relative abundance data, after controlling statistically for geographic proximity among sites. Rhamphicarpa fistulosa infestation, therefore, may influence the competitive balance between rice and its weeds and shape weed community structure. However, experimental studies are required to elucidate the weed host range of R. fistulosa and the direct and indirect effects of this hemiparasite in rice fields in order to predict its net impact on rice and its weed species	['SDG15']

10.1007/s00267-016-0802-3	Understanding Land System Change Through Scenario-Based Simulations: A Case Study from the Drylands in Northern China	The drylands in northern China are expected to face dramatic land system change in the context of socioeconomic development and environmental conservation. Recent studies have addressed changes of land cover with socioeconomic development in the drylands in northern China. However, the changes in land use intensity and the potential role of environmental conservation measures have yet to be adequately examined. Given the importance of land management intensity to the ecological conditions and regional sustainability, our study projected land system change in Hohhot city in the drylands in northern China from 2013 to 2030. Here, land systems are defined as combinations of land cover and land use intensity. Using the CLUMondo model, we simulated land system change in Hohhot under three scenarios: a scenario following historical trends, a scenario with strong socioeconomic and land use planning, and a scenario focused on achieving environmental conservation targets. Our results showed that Hohhot is likely to experience agricultural intensification and urban growth under all three scenarios. The agricultural intensity and the urban growth rate were much higher under the historical trend scenario compared to those with more planning interventions. The dynamics of grasslands depend strongly on projections of livestock and other claims on land resources. In the historical trend scenario, intensively grazed grasslands increase whereas a large amount of the current area of grasslands with livestock converts to forest under the scenario with strong planning. Strong conversion from grasslands with livestock and extensive cropland to semi-natural grasslands was estimated under the conservation scenario. The findings provide an input into discussions about environmental management, planning and sustainable land system design for Hohhot.</p	['SDG15']

10.1515/rtuect-2016-0010	Developing an agro-ecological zoning model for tumbleweed (Salsola kali), as energy crop in drylands of Argentina	Salsola kali is considered extremely valuable as an energy crop worldwide because it adapts easily to environments with strong abiotic stresses (hydric, saline and alkaline) and produces large amounts of biomass in drylands. This species is categorized as an important weed in Argentina. The aim of this work was to design an agro-ecological zoning model for tumbleweed in Argentina, employing a Geography Information System. Based on the bioclimatic requirements for the species and the climatic data for Argentina (1981–2010 period), an agro-climatic suitability map was drawn. This map was superimposed on the saline and alkaline soil maps delineated by the Food and Agriculture Organization for dry climates, generating the agro-ecological zoning on a scale of 1 : 500 000. This zoning revealed very suitable and suitable cultivation areas on halomorphic soils. The potential growing areas extend from N of the Salta province (approximately 22° S) to the Santa Cruz province (50° S). The use of tumbleweed on halomorphic soils under semi-arid to arid conditions, for the dual purpose of forage use and source of lignocellulosic material for bioenergy, could improve agricultural productivity in these lands. Furthermore, it could also contribute to their environmental sustainability, since the species can be used to reclaim saline soils over the years. Based on international bibliography, the authors outlined an agro-ecological zoning model. This model may be applied to any part of the world, using the agro-ecological limits presented here	['SDG15']

10.1371/journal.pone.0154573	Ecosystem Services Modeling as a Tool for Defining Priority Areas for Conservation	Conservationists often have difficulty obtaining financial and social support for protected areas that do not demonstrate their benefits for society. Therefore, ecosystem services have gained importance in conservation science in the last decade, as these services provide further justification for appropriate management and conservation of natural systems. We used InVEST software and a set of GIS procedures to quantify, spatialize and evaluated the overlap between ecosystem services-carbon stock and sediment retention-and a biodiversity proxy-habitat quality. In addition, we proposed a method that serves as an initial approach of a priority areas selection process. The method considers the synergism between ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Our study region is the Iron Quadrangle, an important Brazilian mining province and a conservation priority area located in the interface of two biodiversity hotspots, the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. The resultant priority area for the maintenance of the highest values of ecosystem services and habitat quality was about 13% of the study area. Among those priority areas, 30% are already within established strictly protected areas, and 12% are in sustainable use protected areas. Following the transparent and highly replicable method we proposed in this study, conservation planners can better determine which areas fulfill multiple goals and can locate the trade-offs in the landscape. We also gave a step towards the improvement of the habitat quality model with a topography parameter. In areas of very rugged topography, we have to consider geomorfometric barriers for anthropogenic impacts and for species movement and we must think beyond the linear distances. Moreover, we used a model that considers the tree mortality caused by edge effects in the estimation of carbon stock. We found low spatial congruence among the modeled services, mostly because of the pattern of sediment retention distribution.Laboratório de Ecologia e Conservação, Departamento de Biologia Geral, Instituto de Ciências Biológicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, BrazilLaboratório de Ecologia Espacial e Conservação (LEEC), Departamento de Ecologia, Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita (UNESP), Rio Claro, São Paulo, Brazi	['SDG15']

10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.111	The contribution to climate change of the organic versus conventional wheat farming: A case study on the carbon footprint of wholemeal bread production in Italy	Despite many studies in literature demonstrate the environmental sustainability of organic food, a debate is still open in the scientific community on the effect of organic farming on global warming and climate change mitigation. This paper aims to contribute to a more informed debate on the actual contribution to climate change in terms of GHG emissions of organic and conventional agriculture. For this purpose, the production process of an organic vs conventional wholemeal bread locally produced in central Italy by a small-medium bakery enterprise was compared and the carbon footprint (CF) was assessed by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology.We found that the CF of 1 kg of the conventional wholemeal bread was 24% less respect to the same organic bread, with 1,18 and 1,55 kg CO(2)eq respectively. On the contrary, if the CF is assessed per unit of cultivated area (hectare), wheat organic cultivation showed a better performance in terms of GHG emissions than conventional by 60%, with 1,15 and 2,87 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) respectively. The higher CF per unit of organic product is due to the lower yield per unit of area cultivated with organic farming and to the consequent attribution to a smaller amount of products of the GHG emissions generated in the field phase of the life cycle. Whereas, the CF per hectare is higher when conventional practices are applied due to the higher use of raw materials (higher seed density, agrochemicals for fertilization and plant protection) respect to the same organic system.Results of the study demonstrate that organic farming for wheat cultivation in Italy is a low-carbon agriculture with a lower contribution to climate change in terms of GHG emissions per hectare respect to the conventional wheat cultivation, although implications of the reduced productivity and the consequent need of more cultivated land should be considered. However, more research is needed to better explore the potential of organic farming and to improve organic food production, optimizing the balance between the use of resources and yields, to ensure sufficient organic food supply at global level.A more comprehensive assessment of the actual GHG emitted in the atmosphere from both organic and conventional agricultural systems can be provided when the CF is assessed per unit of area, in addition to the CF per product unit, especially if also the carbon sink of the agrosystem is included.

10.1071/pc16030	Where to survey? Spatial biodiversity survey gap analysis: A multicriteria approach	The aim of this study was to quantify the relative effort for biodiversity surveys across the public forest estate in the south-west of Western Australia. We collated information on historical surveys into a metadatabase and recorded locations where surveys had been conducted in a spatial geodatabase. We then used multicriteria modelling to rank land conservation units on the basis of relative survey effort. The results indicated that the western, particularly the south-western, parts of the study area were relatively well surveyed while eastern parts were relatively poorly surveyed. This is likely to reflect greater habitat loss and fragmentation of vegetation on the eastern margins of the forest estate where it adjoins the extensively cleared Western Australian wheatbelt. There was also an emphasis on monitoring biodiversity in forest habitats closer to the main population centres of the south-west. The results of this analysis provide a basis for assessing future survey needs for the region, which should also consider: patterns of distribution in species richness; the extent, connectivity and conservation status of native vegetation; and the relative risks posed to biodiversity by infrastructure and industrial land uses. We discuss the potential limitations of the multicriteria modelling approach in the context of our study. </jats:p	['SDG15']

This is dramatically true in the Atlantic Forest, where occurrence of this large felid is now restricted to very few remaining areas. We used a non-invasive DNA analysis to search through felid scats collected in the Santa Virginia Unit (SVU) of the Serra do Mar State Park, to test for the potential presence of jaguar there. Our results indicated at least three individuals (two females and one male) inside SVU, thus confirming at least temporary presence of this top predator in this important protected area. It is now crucial to intensify studies in that area and surroundings, to evaluate the status of these individuals and identify conservation needs to urgently improve the prospects for the establishment of a resident population, allowing it to expand to adjoining units of the Serra do Mar State Park and Serra da Bocaina National Park.</jats:p	['SDG15']

Diversity of antibiotic-producing actinomycetes in mangrove forest of Torosiaje, Gorontalo, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 1453-1461. Actinomycetes for antibiotic production have been studied at various extreme environments. Mangrove forest of Torosiaje in Gorontalo Province, Indonesia has unique geomorphological conditions where the forest is surrounded by karst ecosystem consisting of fringe and overwash types. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the distribution and diversity of antibiotic-producing Actinomycetes in various rhizosphere including different locations and mangrove species. Samples of rhizosphere soil were collected in the depth of 0-10 cm, which was then subjected to detailed physicochemical analysis. Actinomycetes were collected through heating pre-treatment (60oC for 15 min) followed by culturing in the Starch Casein Agar medium supplemented with cycloheximide and nystatin. The screening process of antibiotic-producing Actinomycetes was based on Agar block method against pathogenic microorganisms. Grouping of Actinomycetes was determined by ARDRA fingerprinting analysis. The diversity of Actinomycetes was analyzed based on sequencing of 16S rDNA. The results showed that the distribution of Actinomycetes was found in overwash type, middle zone and upper zone of fringe type including rhizosphere of 7 species of mangrove. The highest population of Actinomycetes was found in rhizosphere of R. mucronata at the overwash type, and the lowest one found in rhizosphere of R. apiculata at the middle zone of fringe type. A total of 77 isolates amongst 167 isolate collection showed antibacterial activities. Forty seven representatives from 77 antibacterial-activities isolates were selected using ARDRA for partial characterization according to their phylogenetic diversity. Sequencing and analysis of 16S rDNA from selectedrepresentative isolates displayed the presence of members associated with Actinomycetes genera such as Streptomyces, Amycolatopsis, Saccharomonospora, and Nocardiopsis. The member of genus Streptomyces such as Streptomyces qinglanensis and Streptomyces champavatii were distributed across locations. Genus Saccharomonospora and Nocardiopsis were mostly found at the overwash type, while Amycolatopsis was found at the upper zone of fringe type.</jats:p	['SDG15']

Results indicate that these farm households are willing to adopt improved biomass cookstove innovations if this leads to economic savings. Moreover, results suggest significant positive environmental externalities. On a per household basis, we found that adopters collect about 70 kg less wood and about 20 kg less dung each month. The adoption of improved biomass cookstoves reduces harvest pressure on local forest stands: assuming an average of 120 metric tons of biomass per ha, we find the potential reduction in deforestation amounts to some 1400 ha per year – an important saving. Further, the reduced use of dung as a fuel has a positive impact on soil productivity in agriculture	['SDG15']

In line with environmentally sustainable palm oil certification, targeted grazing can minimize the dependency on herbicides for controlling weeds in plantations. Here, we show for the first time that targeted grazing would control weeds and improve biodiversity of desired animal species. We sampled birds at 45 oil palm plantations in Peninsular Malaysia that were systematically grazed, non-systematically grazed, or herbicide-controlled plantations without cattle grazing. We found that bird species richness increased with size of grazing area, but decreased with number of cattle. Bird abundance was higher in the systematic grazing system, but negatively related to number of cattle. These factors explained 18.41 and 25.34% of the observed variations in bird species richness and abundance, respectively. Our findings suggest that targeted cattle grazing can be instrumental for transforming conventional oil palm agriculture into more biodiversity-friendly agroecosystems. Targeted grazing is likely to be practical under field conditions in major palm oil producing countries. In addition, the use of targeted grazing as a biological control method for weeds would be welcomed by palm oil consumers and encouraged by sustainable palm oil certification bodies such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)	['SDG15']

10.1139/cjfr-2017-0196	Use of shrub willows (Salix spp.) to develop soil communities during coal mine restoration	Afforestation or reforestation in highly degraded environments (e.g., surface mines) is often complicated by the total removal of vegetation and severe soil degradation that occurs during mining operations, necessitating revegetation to be undertaken in tandem with the re-establishment of soil developmental processes. Shrub willows (Salix spp.) are effective as colonizer species initiating revegetation dynamics; however, it is unclear if they also serve as nurse plants facilitating the establishment of soil communities such as those of nematodes. We established a study in a former coal mine site in New Brunswick, Canada, to assess whether the presence of willows on otherwise bare, poorly developed soil contributed to nematode community development and to what degree landform design (e.g., slope) may influence these dynamics. Our results demonstrate that willows can facilitate nematode communities at this site, but that slope strongly influences these effects, likely as a consequence of hydrology and overland water flow. These results confirm the beneficial role that willows can play in reforestation of highly degraded environments both for revegetation and for the re-initiation of soil ecosystem processes. </jats:p	['SDG15']

10.3389/fpls.2017.02196	Vegetation cover dynamics and resilience to climatic and hydrological disturbances in seasonal floodplain: The effects of hydrological connectivity	Floodplain wetlands are valuable ecosystems for maintaining biodiversity, but are vulnerable to hydrological modification and climatic extremes. The floodplain wetlands in the middle Yangtze region are biodiversity hotspots, particularly important for wintering migratory waterbirds. In recent years, extremely low winter water level events frequently occurred in the middle Yangtze River. The hydrological droughts greatly impacted the development and distribution of the wet meadows, one of the most important ecological components in the floodplains, which is vital for the survival of many migratory waterbirds wintering in the Yangtze region. To effectively manage the wet meadows, it is critical to pinpoint the drivers for their deterioration. In this study, we assessed the effects of hydrological connectivity on the ecological stability of wet meadow in Poyang Lake for the period of 2000 to 2016. We used the time series of MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) as a proxy for productivity to infer the ecological stability of wet meadows in terms of resistance and resilience. Our results showed that (1) the wet meadows developed in freely connected lakes had significantly higher resilience; (2) wet meadows colonizing controlled lakes had higher resistance to water level anomalies; (3) there was no difference in the resistance to rainfall anomaly between the two types of lakes; (4) the wet meadow in freely connected lakes might approach a tipping point and a regime shift might be imminent. Our findings suggest that adaptive management at regional- (i.e., operation of Three Gorges Dam) and site-scale (e.g., regulating sand mining) are needed to safeguard the long-term ecological stability of the system, which in term has strong implications for local, regional and global biodiversity conservation	['SDG15']

10.3390/su10030856	Restoration plan for degraded forest in the democratic people's republic of Korea considering suitable tree species and spatial distribution	The ecosystem across the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is threatened by deforestation. However, there is very little attention being given to government efforts for afforestation and rehabilitation plan. The most significant barriers to addressing this problem are technique limitations, availability of information, and lack of a stepwise forest management plan. This study identifies spatially suitable tree species, and establishes a stepwise restoration plan to support decision making for restoring degraded forest in the DPRK throughout a suitable restoration map. First off, target species were chosen from reference data, and spatial distribution maps for each tree species were prepared based on social needs as well as natural conditions in the DPRK. The suitable restoration map was calculated by two priorities in a weighting method; suitable priority, and distributional clustering level. Finally, the 23 afforestation species were selected for the suitable restoration map, including 11 coniferous and 12 deciduous tree species. We introduced a stepwise afforestation/restoration plan of degraded forest in the DPRK; general (long-term), detailed (medium-term), implementation (short-term) plans. Maps with different spatial resolutions were prepared for each of the plans. A restoration map with 12.5 km spatial resolution can be used for the general plan at the national level, and maps with 5 km and 1 km spatial resolutions can be used for detailed plan at the local level and implementation plan at the site level, respectively	['SDG15']

10.1071/wf17132	An analysis of Southeastern US prescribed burn weather windows: Seasonal variability and El Niño associations	Fire plays an important role in wildland ecosystems, critical to sustaining biodiversity, wildlife habitat and ecosystem health. By area, 70% of US prescribed burns take place in the Southeast, where treatment objectives range widely and accomplishing them depends on finding specific weather conditions for the effective and controlled application of fire. The climatological variation of the preferred weather window is examined here using two weather model reanalyses, with focus on conditions critical to smoke dispersion and erratic fire behaviour. Large spatial gradients were evident in some months (e.g. 3× change across the Appalachian Mountains in winter). Over most of the Southeast, availability of preferred conditions in summer was several (up to 8) times less than in autumn or winter. We offer explanation for this variability in terms of the mean seasonal changes of key weather conditions (especially mixing height and transport wind). We also examine the interannual variability of the preferred weather window for linkage to the tropical Pacific (1979–2010). Associations with the subset of El Niño events identified by outgoing-longwave-radiation suggest skilful seasonal fire weather forecasts are feasible. Together, these findings offer a predictive tool to prioritise allocation of scarce prescribed fire resources and maximise annual area treated across this landscape.</jats:p	['SDG15']

It is mainly focused in solutions using living organisms (in particular plants and microorganisms) to perform functions such as those of soil- and water-bioengineering interventions in order to ensure the safety of human infrastructures and constructions in contexts of conflict between natural processes and human needs. Further it handles the problematic of reintroducing natural processes and functions in the built environment (urban, industrial, infrastructures etc.) in order to recover, recreate or reinvent nature in humanized landscapes and developing a more creative relation between humans and natural elements, processes and functions. It presents, furthermore, the contribution of natural solutions to a wide variety of decontamination processes and prevention and recovery of degraded land and natural resources. Finally, it discusses the way these solutions can be implemented and the cultural, organizational, administrative and governance paradigmatic and practice changes it implies.

10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.06.006	Species extinctions strengthen the relationship between biodiversity and resource use efficiency	Evidence from terrestrial ecosystems indicates that biodiversity relates to ecosystem functions (BEF), but this relationship varies in its strength, in part, as a function of habitat connectivity and fragmentation. In primary producers, common proxies of ecosystem function include productivity and resource use efficiency. In aquatic primary producers, macroecological studies have observed BEF variance, where ecosystems with lower richness show stronger BEF relationships. However, aquatic ecosystems are less affected by habitat fragmentation than terrestrial systems and the mechanism underlying this BEF variance has been largely overlooked. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation of BEF variance using a trait-based, numerical model parameterized for phytoplankton. Resource supply in our model fluctuates recurrently, similar to many coastal systems. Our findings show that following an extinction event, the BEF relationship can be driven by the species that are the most efficient resource users. Specifically, in species-rich assemblages, increased redundancy of efficient resource users minimizes the risk of losing function following an extinction event. On the other hand, in species-poor assemblages, low redundancy of efficient resource users increases the risk of losing ecosystem function following extinctions. Furthermore, we corroborate our findings with what has been observed from large-scale field studies on phytoplankton	['SDG15']
10.1002/ecs2.2227	Risk of vector tick exposure initially increases, then declines through time in response to wildfire in California	Abstract Identifying the effects of human‐driven perturbations, such as species introductions or habitat fragmentation, on the ecology and dynamics of infectious disease has become a central focus of disease ecologists. Yet, comparatively little is known about how the ecology of zoonotic disease systems responds to catastrophic disturbance events such as wildfires or hurricanes. In California, wildfire disturbance is centrally important to the ecology of forests and oak woodlands and is projected to increase in severity and extent under future climate change. Here, taking advantage of a recent wildfire as a natural experiment, we investigate the effects of wildfire disturbance on the ecology of tick‐borne disease in California oak woodlands. We find that wildfire leads to elevated abundance of questing adult and nymphal western blacklegged ticks (Ixodes pacificus) in the year following fire, relative to unburned control plots, but that vector tick abundance declines sharply in the following two years. We find that the abundance of non‐competent hosts (western fence lizards) for the Lyme disease bacterium is unaffected by fire, but that the abundances of important reproductive hosts (deer) for ticks and reservoir hosts (dusky‐footed woodrats) for tick‐borne pathogens are significantly negatively affected by fire. We found ticks and hosts infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato only within the burn extent and only in the year following the wildfire, though rates of infection were exceedingly low representing little risk to humans. In aggregate, due to the differential effects of this catastrophic disturbance event on different key host species and vector tick life stages in the transmission of tick‐borne pathogens, we conclude that wildfire may potentially increase risk of exposure to vector ticks in the first year following wildfire in California, but that risk is dampened substantially in following years due to tick population declines and loss of key reservoir hosts from the system	['SDG15']

10.11144/javeriana.sc23-2.aado	Abundance and diversity of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) in rivers of the Andean Eastern Hills of Bogotá (Colombia), and its relationship with water stream physicochemical variables	Black flies are abundant benthic organisms in well-oxygenated running water and are considered effective bioindicators of water quality. Information on the ecology of these organisms at the species level is important, since up to now information has mainly been available on a family level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of black flies and their relationships to a group of physical and chemical factors in four small rivers of the Eastern Hills around Bogotá, Colombia. These headwaters are protected by the Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogotá. Black fly larvae and pupae were collected during four sampling periods during the dry season to the early rainy season of 2012. Multivariate methods were used to determine the presence of each species in relation to dissolved oxygen, nitrates, pH, temperature, and water velocity. PCA ordination revealed a physicochemical environment with a tendency towards a certain homogeneity in the fourrivers studied. The DCA ordination confirmed that in La Vieja River the G. ortizi complex dominated while S. muiscorum was dominant in the other three rivers. Similarly, according to the NMDS, the composition of black flies in Arzobispo and Chorro de Padilla rivers was similar, while that of El Delirio and La Vieja rivers were different, especially in this last river. The rivers hadlow species richness (four species and one species complex). Simulium muiscorum was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen, temperature and current velocity while S. ignescens was associated with slightly more oxygenated waters and S. furcilatum with fastercurrents.The low species diversity and richness for the four rivers is consistent with previous report sof low Neotropical diversity of black flies. Results showed that simuliid species could possibly be good indicators of the environmental conditions of Eastern Hills rivers around Bogotá.</jats:p	['SDG15']

In 2009, the president of CYUT signed the Talloires Declaration to show his commitment for promoting environmental sustainability on campus. In 2012, CYUT and many other universities in Taiwan cofounded the Green University Union of Taiwan (GUUT) to collaboratively promote the concept of environmental sustainability. Following the announcement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations in 2015, CYUT has been putting a lot of effort into converting itself into a green university. Four different fields of management, which are energy and resources management, accident prevention and rescue management, occupational safety and health management, and environmental management, have been promoted in the campus of CYUT for this cause. Furthermore, four management practices including implementing management systems, organizing green courses, promoting green activities and creating green environment, have been applied to improve the effectiveness of the campus management. In the case of energy and resources management in particular, not only ISO 50001 and 14001 management systems were implemented but also an intelligent energy network (iEN) was established for maintaining effective usage of the campus energy. For years of striving in creating a green university, CYUT had several remarkable accomplishments. The green open space ratio in campus is 94.43%. Water-saving equipment was installed in the whole campus and reclaimed water is collected for urban reuse. Garbage reduction and classification have been enforced to make ease for later treatments. For issues related to energy and climate change, strategies, such as renewal of high energy consuming facilities, installation of green roofs, utilization of recycle energy and education of staffs were enacted and the consumed energy in campus gradually decreased in recent years. For example, the electricity and oil (including gasoline and diesel) consumption in campus of 2017 were 7.59% and 14% lower than those of 2016, respectively. In order to overcome the challenges from climate change, CYUT will continue on its process of creating a low-carbon campus focusing on energy sustainability.</jats:p	['SDG15']

This paper assessed the overall productivity of cultivated land in Yuanjiang city from the perspectives of quantitative structure, spatial distribution and correlation with national land use. We applied statistical and GIS (geographic information system) spatial analysis methods to 16 secondary indicators of productivity. The results showed that the productivity index of cultivated land ranged from 1642.79 to 4140.09, concentrated in classes 2&ndash;6, among the most productive of 15 classes in total. The cultivated productivity indexes of most towns showed quantitative structural patterns of &ldquo;inverted pyramid&rdquo; and &ldquo;dumbbell&rdquo; types. Cultivated lands with high productivity showed a spatial distribution that decreased from the north to the south and increased from the center to the periphery. The spatial distribution of the higher-level classes in the cultivated land productivity index and the national cultivated land use index was similar. The correlation coefficient between the indexes for cultivated land productivity and the annual standard crop yield was 0.8817, implying that the index reflected local grain production capacity very well. In general, the research offered a reference and technical support for the sustainable use of cultivated land resources and enhanced regional cultivated land production capacity	['SDG15']

10.1071/mf18065	An angled rack with a bypass and a nature-like fishway pass Atlantic salmon smolts downstream at a hydropower dam	Hydropower dams disrupt longitudinal connectivity and cause fragmentation of river systems, which has led to declines in migratory fish species. Atlantic salmon smolts rely on intact longitudinal connectivity to move downstream from rearing habitats in freshwater to feeding grounds at sea. Smolts often suffer increased mortality and delays when they encounter hydropower plants during their downstream migration. Currently, there are few examples of downstream passage solutions that allow safe and timely passage. We assessed the performance of two passage solutions at a hydropower dam, namely, an angled 15-mm rack with a bypass and a large nature-like fishway. The performance of these new fish passage solutions was evaluated by tracking radio-tagged Atlantic salmon smolts as they encountered the facilities. The radio-tagged smolts passed the dam 9.5h after release (median) and exhibited a dam-passage efficiency of 84%, with passage rates increasing with body length. Fish passage occurred through both the rack bypass and the nature-like fishway. The passage efficiencies were 70–95% for the rack bypass and 47% for the nature-like fisway. The new fish passage facilities resulted in improved passage conditions at the site, confirming that angled racks with bypasses as best-practise solutions for downstream passage, but also that large nature-like fishways may act as downstream passage routes for salmon. </jats:p	['SDG15']

10.3390/s18113869	Predicting profile soil properties with reflectance spectra via Bayesian covariate-assisted external parameter orthogonalization	In situ, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) profile soil sensors have the potential to provide both rapid and high-resolution prediction of multiple soil properties for precision agriculture, soil health assessment, and other applications related to environmental protection and agronomic sustainability. However, the effects of soil moisture, other environmental factors, and artefacts of the in-field spectral data collection process often hamper the utility of in situ DRS data. Various processing and modeling techniques have been developed to overcome these challenges, including external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) transformation of the spectra. In addition, Bayesian modeling approaches may improve prediction over traditional partial least squares (PLS) regression. The objectives of this study were to predict soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and texture fractions using a large, regional dataset of in situ profile DRS spectra and compare the performance of (1) traditional PLS analysis, (2) PLS on EPO-transformed spectra (PLS-EPO), (3) PLS-EPO with the Bayesian Lasso (PLS-EPO-BL), and (4) covariate-assisted PLS-EPO-BL models. In this study, soil cores and in situ profile DRS spectrometer scans were obtained to ~1 m depth from 22 fields across Missouri and Indiana, USA. In the laboratory, soil cores were split by horizon, air-dried, and sieved (&lt;2 mm) for a total of 708 samples. Soil properties were measured and DRS spectra were collected on these air-dried soil samples. The data were randomly split into training (n = 308), testing (n = 200), and EPO calibration (n = 200) sets, and soil textural class was used as the categorical covariate in the Bayesian models. Model performance was evaluated using the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). For the prediction of soil properties using a model trained on dry spectra and tested on field moist spectra, the PLS-EPO transformation dramatically improved model performance relative to PLS alone, reducing RMSEP by 66% and 53% for SOC and TN, respectively, and by 76%, 91%, and 87% for clay, silt, and sand, respectively. The addition of the Bayesian Lasso further reduced RMSEP by 4&#8315;11% across soil properties, and the categorical covariate reduced RMSEP by another 2&#8315;9%. Overall, this study illustrates the strength of the combination of EPO spectral transformation paired with Bayesian modeling techniques to overcome environmental factors and in-field data collection artefacts when using in situ DRS data, and highlights the potential for in-field DRS spectroscopy as a tool for rapid, high-resolution prediction of soil properties	['SDG15']

Rio Grande basin evaluation was performed by using this following database: soil classes, land use classification, water quality index, and economic ecological index. It was performed multi-criteria decision analysis based on analytic hierarchy process methodology. 52.5% of the studied area was classified as “good” preservation condition. Alto Grande (GD1), Mortes/Jacaré (GD2) and Furnas (GD3) units did not contain significant percentages of their areas corresponding to the preservation class “very good”. In the studied area, 34.51% was classified as “medium” preservation condition, thus indicating the need for effective measures for the river basin conservation. These findings highlight the potential importance of including the SEA in the decision-making process for plans, policies and programs related to the integrated management of water resources	['SDG15']
10.11118/actaun201866061543	Land degradation in the calorie model: Dynamics of the stationary state	The environmental aspects play more and more important role in an economic life of the society. One aspect the Classics did not see clearly in the context of the stationary state. This paper explores implications of the introduction of the land degradation into the concept of the classical stationary state. The calorie model is used to model the dynamics of the stationary state. Several new theorems are derived in the paper. The variables of interest are interdependent. The dynamics of the stationary state is, hence, conditional. The stationary state is more sensitive to the land degradation under contemporary conditions than to the population growth. This explains its increasing role in economic policy and economic discussions	['SDG15']

10.1080/17440571003669175	Experience versus perception of corruption: Russia as a test case	Corruption is important because it undermines bureaucratic predictability and is a potential threat to support for a political regime. The perception of corruption is the most commonly used measure of the actual incidence of corruption. This article marshals the New Russia Barometer survey data to challenge this assumption. Even though most Russians perceive a variety of everyday public services as corrupt, this assessment is not based on first-hand experience. Only a minority pays bribes. We test four hypotheses about differences in individual perception and experience of paying bribes: the ability to pay, contact with public services, normative acceptability and political awareness. Contact is most important for paying bribes whereas political awareness is most important for the perception of corruption. We also test how much the perception and experience of corruption, as against other forms of political and economic performance, affect support for the regime. Support is driven by the substantive performance of government, especially its management of the economy, rather than by the perception or experience of corruption	['SDG16']

10.1177/0020852310372450	In what we trust? A multi-level study into trust in parliament as an evaluation of state characteristics	A basic level of trust in the political system is considered to be the cornerstone of modern-day democracy. Consequently, scholars and politicians have been concerned with low or declining levels of trust in political institutions. This article focuses on trust in parliament. Many theories have been offered to explain cross-national differences or longitudinal changes in trust, but they have not been subject to systematic empirical tests. This article aims to fill that theoretical and empirical gap. I conceptualize trust in parliament as citizens’ rather rational evaluations of the state—citizen relationship along four dimensions: competence, intrinsic care, accountability, and reliability. Next, I relate state characteristics to each of these four aspects, and hypothesize how they might affect political trust. These hypotheses are tested simultaneously by multi-level analysis on stapled data from the European Social Survey 2002—06. The tests show that three factors explain very well the cross-national differences in trust: corruption, the electoral system, and former regime type. Somewhat surprisingly, economic performance is not related to trust in parliament. Although the analyses do not explain changes in trust across time very well, they at least dismiss some of the existing explanations. Points for practitionersThis article describes to what extent levels of trust in parliament differ across countries and change across time, and tests several explanations for comparatively low or longitudinally declining levels of trust. It offers practitioners a theoretical approach to make sense of trust issues by distinguishing four trust aspects. Moreover, it shows that objective state characteristics are crucial in explaining cross-national differences. Widespread perceptions of corruption are most harmful to trust in parliament, while democratic rule and a proportional electoral system are beneficial. Equally important, actual economic performance is unrelated to trust. Institutional designs that emphasize care and integrity appear to be more beneficial than ones that emphasize competence and performance	['SDG16']

10.1017/s1742058x10000159	Learning race, socializing blackness: A Cross-Generational Analysis of Black Americans' Racial Socialization Experiences	AbstractContemporary discourse about Black Americans questions the loyalties of younger Blacks to the advancement of the Black racial group. This discourse often compares the commitment of Black Americans who came of age during the Civil Rights Movement era to those who came of age during the post-Civil Rights Movement era. Fueling this discourse is a working assumption that somehow younger Black Americans have a different understanding about race and its role in Blacks' political interests. This begs the question whether there are generational differences in the ways that Black Americans learn about race, or racial socialization, perhaps with implications for distinct value orientations about Black politics. Using public opinion data from an original survey, the 2007 National Politics and Socialization Survey (NPSS), this paper compares the racial socialization experiences of four generations of Black Americans—(1) World War II generation (age 67 and older, born in and before 1940); (2) civil rights generation (ages 54–66, born 1953–1941); (3) mid-civil rights generation (ages 43–53, born 1964–1954); and (4) post-civil rights generation Black Americans (age 42 and under, born 1965 and after). Results of ordered probit regression analyses indicate minimal generational differences. Differences emerge in emphases on racial socialization messages about Black public behavior, Black intraracial relations, Black interracial relations, and composite factor loadings of Black consciousness and Black protectiveness messages.</jats:p	['SDG16']

This governmentalisation produces powerful incentives to conform to the rule-bound and institutionalised knowledge practices that institutions, government departments, corporations, and NGOs understand as being capable of telling truths about young people and about risk. I argue that knowledge practices in the social sciences should trouble what counts as truth, as evidence, and the ways in which these truths can be produced.These interests will be examined through a discussion of the ways in which Tim Winton\u27s novel Breath can be read as an allegorical tale about the terror of being ordinary: and of the teenage years as being a time in a life in which the fear of being ordinary compels Winton\u27s key characters to seek out, sometimes stumble upon that which promises to make their\u27s a life less ordinary. Here risk is something that breathes energy and purpose into lifeworlds that are dominated by the institutionalised ordinariness of family, school, and work. As an allegorical tale told from the vantage point of hindsight, Breath unsettles what it is that the social sciences can tell us about youth (as becoming) and risk (as mitigated by prudential foresight)	['SDG16']

10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.7	National study of suicide in all people with a criminal justice history	Context: Previous research has focused on suicide among male prisoners and ex-prisoners, but little is known about risk in the wider offender population. Objective: To examine suicide risk over 3 decades among all people processed by a national criminal justice system. Design: Nested case-control study. Setting: The whole Danish population. Participants: Interlinked national registers identified all adult suicides during 1981 to 2006 according to any criminal justice system contact since 1980. Exposure was defined according to history of criminal justice adjudication, up to and including each subject's last judicial verdict before suicide (or date of matching for controls). There were 27 219 suicides and 524 899 controls matched on age, sex, and time, ie, controls were alive when their matched case died. Main Outcome Measure: Suicide. Results: More than a third of all male cases had a criminal justice history, but relative risk against the general population was higher for women than men. Independent effects linked with criminal justice exposure persisted with confounder adjustment. Suicide risk was markedly elevated with custodial sentencing, but the strongest effects were with sentencing to psychiatric treatment and with charges conditionally withdrawn. Risk was raised even in people with a criminal justice history but without custodial sentences or guilty verdicts. It was especially high with recent or frequent contact and in people charged with violent offenses. Conclusions: We examined a section of society in which major health and social problems frequently coexist including offending, psychopathology, and suicidal behavior. The need for developing more far-reaching national suicide prevention strategies is indicated. In particular, improved mental health service provision is needed for all people in contact with the criminal justice system, including those not found guilty and those not given custodial sentences. Our findings also suggest that public services should be better coordinated to tackle co-occurring health and social problems more effectively. ©2011 American Medical Association.

10.1177/0032329211415504	Waves of change within civil society in latin america: Mexico city and são paulo	For the past half a century, Latin American scholars have been pointing toward the emergence of new social actors as agents of social and political democratization. The first wave of actors was characterized by the emergence of novel agents—mainly, new popular movements—of social transformation. At first, the second wave, epitomized by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), was celebrated as the upsurge of a new civil society, but later on, it was the target of harsh criticism. The literature often portrays this development in Latin American civil society as a displacement trend of actors of the first wave by the second wave—“NGOization”—and even denounces new civil society as rootless, depoliticized, and functional to retrenchment. Thus, supposedly, NGOization encumbers social change. The authors argue that NGOization diagnosis is a flawed depiction of change within civil society. Rather than NGOization related to the depoliticization and neoliberalization of civil society, in Mexico City and São Paulo, there has been modernization of organizational ecologies, changes in the functional status of civil society, and interestingly, specialization aimed at shaping public agenda. The authors argue that such specialization, instead of encumbering social change, brings about different repertoires of strategies and skills purposively developed for influencing policy and politics. Their argument relies on comparative systematic evidence. Through network analysis, they examine the organizational ecology of civil society in Mexico City and São Paulo. </jats:p	['SDG16']

However, actions by the Obama administration have further accelerated that reeducation machine by maintaining legislation like NCLB and support for educational corporations. This paper describes how this hypercapitalist conservative machine continues to use forms of signification and resource redistribution as mechanisms of power, masks cultural and intellectual diversity, co-opts identities, and corporatizes all aspects of education (including the ways we construct and understand learning) to interpret them as competition, privatization, and profiteering. Politicians from both (or all) political parties may be so attached to the tentacles of hypercaptialism that radical thought and actions are necessary to save and construct education that is socially just, equitable, and democratic. </jats:p	['SDG16']

Studies exploring unacknowledged victimizations have found that individuals are more likely to acknowledge victimization when the experience meets certain, often stereotypical criteria. This study addressed this issue by integrating literature on victim acknowledgment and stalking victimization to identify correlates of victimization acknowledgment among stalking victims. Data were drawn from the 2006 stalking supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), and the sample included both female and male victims of stalking. Findings revealed support for a “classic stalking script,” which included a reliance on stereotypical types of stalking behavior (i.e., being spied on) that were shown to increase acknowledgment for victims of stalking. Results also described gender based correlates of victimization acknowledgment.</jats:p	['SDG16']
10.1057/jbr.2011.17	The monetary impact of regulating banking and financial sectors by FATF on non-cooperative countries and territories	This article analyzes the monetary consequences of the banking and financial regulatory restrictions imposed in February 2000 by the Financial Action Task Force on money laundering (FATF) on 23 nations placed on the list of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCTs) for not meeting many of the 25 criteria established to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Countries introducing new measures to meet several of the criteria related to banking regulation and additional tightening of financial secrecy were de-listed from the list of NCCTs in as early as 2001 with the last country being de-listed in October 2006. The regulatory measures may have had money, banking and other economic implications motivating an empirical investigation of the issue. Evaluating the experience of the NCCTs with the international regulation of banking and financial sectors aims at determining the monetary impact of the measures. The impact, if any, could possibly require a change in current and future monetary policy conduct in each of these countries. Additionally, the process of identifying what is now known as countries with AML/CFT (anti-money laundering/ counter financing of terrorism) deficiencies is an ongoing declared strategy requiring deriving policy lessons for future regulation. The results reached show that unlike some results in the literature, the measures did not seem to have significantly impacted the monetary variables in the NCCTs. This serves to shed additional light on the monetary policy conduct after introducing these measures and allows further regulation by FATF of banking and financial sectors in countries with AML/CFT deficiencies without concerns about necessarily impacting monetary variables.PublishedN/	['SDG16']

Serbian integral nationalism refers to the strain of Serbian nationalism that called for the integration of all Serb-populated lands into one national state. The author shows how a line of continuity can be traced from military and political elites in the pre-1918 Serbian nationalizing state through nationalist circles in interwar Yugoslavia and finally to the ideology of the Yugoslav army in the Homeland (the Chetniks) in the Yugoslav civil war of 1941-5. The existence of this nationalist impulse, and of its opponents, most notably those in the Austro-Hungarian army during 1903-18 and in the Croatian Ustasha fascist organization, created a ‘dynamic of destruction’ in the South Slav lands which led to repeated instances of mass violence during the period in question.</jats:p	['SDG16']

In this way, FBOs have been represented as merely being co-opted as inexpensive resource providers into the wider governmentalities of neoliberal politics. In this paper we critically question how the concept of neoliberalism has been put to work in accounts of voluntary sector cooption, and argue instead for a recognition of different manifestations of secularism and religion, and their connections to changing political—economic and social contexts. Using the illustration of one particular FBO in the UK, we trace how neoliberalism can be co-constituted through the involvement of FBOs, which can offer various pathways of resistance in and through the pursuit of alternative philosophies of care and political activism	['SDG16']

10.1093/swr/svs012	The significance of animal cruelty in child protection investigations	The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency with which child protection workers (CPWs) in Ontario, Canada, seek information about animal cruelty during investigations of child maltreatment and the extent to which they consider information about animal cruelty when making decisions about whether intervention is required. The CPWs (N = 78) responded to an online survey about their experiences with animal cruelty during child protection investigations in the previous year. Few CPWs routinely asked questions about animal cruelty during investigations, but those who did ask questions were significantly more likely to report disclosures of animal cruelty by children and caregivers than those who did not ask questions. Many CPWs had directly observed children and caregivers physically harming animals. Almost all respondents indicated that animal cruelty was an important factor to consider when making intervention decisions. The results suggest that CPWs should consider routinely asking children and caregivers questions about animal cruelty and observe the behavior and living conditions of family pets when conducting risk assessments. Future research should determine whether animal cruelty is a reliable indicator of exposure to family violence	['SDG16']
10.1017/s0922156512000507	Stability and change in times of fragmentation: The limits of pacta sunt servanda revisited	AbstractStability versus change is one of the fundamental debates of the law of treaties. The limits of pacta sunt servanda – under which conditions a state may derogate from treaty obligations when circumstances change – appears as a constant throughout the history of international law. This article examines the limits of pacta sunt servanda in times of fragmentation. It first discusses the mechanisms of general international law – supervening impossibility of performance and fundamental change of circumstances (Articles 61 and 62 VCLT) in the law of treaties and force majeure and the state of necessity (Articles 23 and 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility) in the law of state responsibility. It is argued that they provide only insufficient means to accommodate change. Against that background, derogation is examined in specific treaty regimes, including international human rights law, the law of the sea, and international investment law. Treaty-based termination/withdrawal clauses and emergency exceptions are analysed accordingly. Especially the latter are formulated in a regime-specific way, adapting derogation from treaty obligations to the requirements of the respective treaty regimes. On the basis of an empirical analysis of relevant state practice it is argued that this regime-specificity – a sign of fragmentation – is especially important since there is an increased need for temporary derogation in contemporary international law.</jats:p	['SDG16']
10.1163/15736121-12341246	Belief in a just world, religiosity and victim blaming	This study investigates the relations between “Belief in a Just World” (BJW), religiosity and victim-blaming attitudes. In particular, the influence of BJW and religiosity on social attitudes is probed. Recent theoretical and psychometric developments in the BJW construct are considered. Thus, 176 Turkish subjects completed measures for BJW-Self (BJW-S)/BJW-Other (BJW-O), “Belief in Immanent/Ultimate Justice,” attitudes towards the poor, and religiosity. Results show that Belief in Ultimate Justice and BJW-S are uniquely related to religiosity. As hypothesized, BJW-O and Belief in Immanent Justice are strongly related to harsh attitudes towards the poor. However, contrary to our expectation, results do not indicate a positive link between religiosity and negative attitudes towards the poor. Study findings also provide strong cross-cultural support for the conceptual and psychometric revisions of the Just-World construct (BJW-S/BJW-O and Immanent/Ultimate Justice). </jats:p	['SDG16']

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to report and analyse a recent case, in which the safeguarding procedure adopted by one local authority was criticised by the High Court. It also seeks to identify the key lessons to be learned.Design/methodology/approachThe paper considers the judgment handed down in the case, sets out its key points and seeks to place the proceedings, and the concerns they reveal, in their context.FindingsIn its conduct of one safeguarding enquiry, West Sussex County Council acted unlawfully, in a manner that breached natural justice and a legitimate expectation to which it had itself given rise. The case raises a number of concerns. It is also consistent with a suspicion that some practitioners, and even some judges, have begun to express: that on occasions, the safeguarding process itself might constitute a form of abuse.Originality/valueThis is believed to be the first time the case has been analysed in such detail, and also the first time it has been placed in the context of those concerns.</jats:sec	['SDG16']

10.1215/00382876-2020181	James Baldwin and the unhistoric life of race	In his essays, James Baldwin emphasizes that white supremacy is a historical trap, which legally and socially debases both whites and blacks. Baldwin claims, however, that if whites recognize it, they can release themselves. In reconsidering Baldwin as a spokesperson of the 1960s civil rights era, it is important to focus on the concept of being trapped in history, which for Baldwin is not just about transforming laws but making manifest a “change of heart” for whites. Being historically “trapped” is the locus for what prevents the social transformation necessary to create just and equal social relations and citizenship in the United States. This essay evaluates Baldwin as a civil rights actor by examining his prescriptions of social change that involve civil rights law and necessary changes in whites’ moral consciousness, as well as the postsegregation vision that Baldwin suggests can occur once whites move beyond being “trapped in history.” To this point, whites escaping from the trap of history, in the legal and moral sense, is the end of whiteness. The final question this essay considers is, what does escaping the trap of history for whites do to black collective racial politics created to combat white abuses?</jats:p	['SDG16']
10.2478/s13374-013-0140-6	Social trust, norms and morality	Abstract                The article approaches the topic of social trust from an evolutionary perspective. It begins by summarising the most influential approaches that have defined specific and social trust and ascertains what causes differences in degrees of trust and how the potential risk of deception might be lowered. It then notes that the basis of morality had already been formed during the era of prehistoric man, who was able to create coalitions against aggressors and to socially control the behaviour of deviants. It points out, however, that having a certain predisposition to behaving cooperatively or an increased sensitivity to recognising and not tolerating behaviour aimed at abusing cooperation is not a sufficient guarantee of the fact that people will always (or at least in the majority of situations) favour cooperation over deception. One of the reasons for this is a tendency to favour short-term gains over long-term ones. The article argues that establishing norms (moral, social and legal) produces a higher level of social trust because it not only “encourages” individuals to behave in certain ways in particular situations but also works as a sanction which “discourages” the individual from socially deviant behaviour. The article then focuses on a debate about the causal relationship between social trust and social capital. It discusses the suggestion that political institutions, government and the judiciary may reduce rather than raise levels of social capital and consequently also the level of social trust. This is partly because of their powerful position and the consequent scope for corruption and partly because of the fact that even when attempting to act honestly, representatives of these institutions cannot sufficiently reflect upon dynamic change at the local level. Finally, the article ends by adopting the position that social trust is built primarily from bottom up and so it is risky to continually doubt the very existence and usefulness of social norms and morality and to be governed simply by legal norms.</jats:p	['SDG16']

This paper considers only two of them: the need for a specific international convention on human rights for older people and the importance of developing a legal branch or specialty promptly referred to the status of the person in old age, called “Elder Law”, including, among other things, tools and institutions, principles, rules, laws, judicial practices and/or specific courts of this matter. Over 30 years ago, Law joined to Gerontology through a “symbolic” document in legal world: Resolution of the United Nations World Assembly on Aging, held in Vienna 1982, Madrid 2002, among others international documents. Ever since, studies slowly began to be developed setting the question about the responsibility and liability we have towards old people, and problems fraught with significance for the Law have emerged, such as: legal capacity, empowerment and autonomy; freedom and civil rights; integrity and health; elder abuse and violence as well as property rights; family legal issues, social rights and social security, access to justice. So, Elder Law is based on five principal issues: Age discrimination, vulnerability and legal capacity in the elderly. Self Determination Human Rights, autonomy and freedom in old age. Participation Human Rights (in family, social and political matters). Social Security Rights, equality and social inclusion. Warranty protection systems and access to justice for old people.Fil: Dabove, Maria Isolina. Universidad de Buenos Aires. Facultad de Derecho.

10.3138/cjccj.2011.e24	"""Criminals are inside of our homes"": Intimate partner violence and fear of crime"	Based on findings that suggest women are more afraid of crime than men despite their overall lower rates of victimization, some scholars have suggested that personal experience plays, at best, a limited role in our feelings of personal safety. Feminist scholars have countered by arguing that many women are abused by their male intimate partners, yet this type of victimization is rarely considered in studies measuring fear of crime. Women’s greater levels of fear, they argue, are therefore justified. This study draws on a nationally representative sample of Canadian women age 15 years or more to examine the relationship between intimate partner violence and fear of crime. The results of regression and cross-tabular analyses lend support to the feminist perspective, finding that physical and emotional abuse and severe physical abuse committed by male intimates generally increases women’s fear of crime. The results demonstrate the importance of considering partner violence when studying women’s fear of crime so as to not misrepresent women’s fear as being “unrealistic.” </jats:p	['SDG16']

10.1177/0022343313503179	The inequality-conflict nexus re-examined: Income, education and popular rebellions	The impact of inequality on the outbreak of intrastate armed conflicts or civil wars has recently attracted considerable interest in conflict research. In contrast to previous studies that have focused on inequality in the total population (vertical inequality), recent studies have analysed inequality between certain groups of people (horizontal inequality), and found that inequality significantly increases the likelihood of conflict onset. However, most of the recent studies on the inequality–conflict nexus have focused on conflicts fought between ethnic groups. The relation between inequality and other (non-ethnic) categories of conflicts has attracted less attention. The present study aims to address this gap: it implements a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relation between inequality and popular rebellions, a subset of conflicts where mobilization transcends ethnic boundaries and hostilities involve popular participation. Based on a sample of 77 popular rebellions and new global data on vertical inequality in income and education, this study shows that inequality significantly increases the likelihood of popular rebellion onset. In addition, the study reveals that inequality proxies (income and education Gini indices) outperform proxies of the absolute level of income (GDP per capita) in the model of popular rebellion onset, suggesting that it is relative, not absolute, well-being that ultimately motivates people to rise up in arms. </jats:p	['SDG16']

In both strategies, advocates “foreground” and criticize norms supporting the institutional status quo before either promoting an alternative existing norm via normative reframing of the issue, or creating and promoting an entirely new norm via normative innovation to build support for new institutional arrangements. Drawing on examples of institutional change addressing the problems of climate change and violence against women, the analysis illustrates how these strategies are especially effective in the face of opposition from vested interests or problematic existing norms.</jats:p	['SDG16']

ABSTRACTThis commentary reviews Maruyama's article ‘Japan's post-war Ainu policy: why the Japanese Government has not recognised Ainu indigenous rights?’ (Maruyama 2013a), published in this journal. Maruyama criticises the government for its reluctance to enact a new Ainu law to guarantee indigenous rights, even after Japan's ratification of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). However, in actuality, the government is searching for the foundation of new Ainu policies in the existing legal frameworks and trying to guarantee some elements of indigenous rights. Japan's case suggests the possibility of realising indigenous rights without the enactment of a specific law.</jats:p	['SDG16']

Based on qualitative research among South African inmates and ex-inmates, we propose that prison gangs be considered adaptation strategies to the extremely coercive and oppressive environments of prisons. We focus on the relationship between gang involvement in prison, violent acts among inmates, and the risk of being subjected to violence during incarceration. By providing emic perspectives, we aim to demonstrate how inmates negotiate three types of social roles, largely defined by their ability and willingness to use violence: franse, gangster, and wyfie. Our findings suggest that prison gangs may jeopardize the personal safety of inmates, but can also paradoxically offer some inmates the opportunity to establish a sense of safety and agency by avoiding random violence.</jats:p	['SDG16']

The article starts by reviewing the various ‘models of disability’ prevailing in the past and the respective ideas of justice underlying them. The charity model, for instance, was rooted in ideas of divine justice and human beneficence, where care for the disabled led in practice to their being segregated from the rest of society, while the medical model saw justice in terms of treatments or compensations for individual pathologies rather than of positive enablement for active living. The CRPD overturns these models and the related conceptions of justice by emphasising society's obligations towards persons with disabilities and, above all, their human right to full inclusion and participation in society. The key concepts are empowerment and capability. In Italy these concepts and this new conception of justice have started to be applied by the Osservatorio nazionale sulla condizione delle persone con disabilità, the body created to monitor the effective application of the CRPD in Italy, and they are included in the two-year action programme on disability, approved by the Italian government in October 2013.</jats:p	['SDG16']

10.4324/9780203117866	Global terrorism, risk and the state	Something is rotten in the body of criminology. At a time when evidence of corporate harm, white-collar criminality and corruption abound, our discipline finds itself in a state of paralysis; a state in which we seem unable to offer credible explanations for developing forms of crime and criminality, precisely when such explanations are urgently required. We do not appear to possess the theoretical tools to respond to crucial contemporary events such as the ongoing global economic crisis, the endemic criminality in the News International empire, the explosion and subsequent haemorrhaging of oil from the Deepwater Horizon, or the seemingly unending series of international financial frauds which have emerged over the past quarter of a century (see Levi, 2008). Moreover, not only have we failed to generate adequate critical insights into the genesis of these harmful activities and events, we have also failed to theorise the contexts in which they are reproduced and virtually given up suggesting alternative forms of social and economic organisation which may reduce their incidence (Dean, 2009). If this latter aspiration is thought to lie outside the remit of the criminological discipline (see Loader and Sparks, 2011), it is our contention that we must re-incorporate broader political aims and ideals into the criminological enterprise	['SDG16']

Explaining ethnic fractionalization	Ethnic fractionalization (EF) is frequently used as an explanatory tool in models of economic development, civil war and public goods provision. However, if EF is endogenous to political and economic change, its utility for further research diminishes. This turns out not to be the case. This paper provides the first comprehensive model of EF as a dependent variable. It contributes new data on the founding date of the largest ethnic group in each state. It builds political and international variables into the analysis alongside historical and geoclimatic parameters. It extends previous work by testing models of politically relevant EF. In addition, this research interprets model results in light of competing theories of nationalism and political change. Results show that cross-national variation in EF is largely exogenous to modern politico-economic change. However, the data are inconclusive with respect to competing geoclimatic, historical institutional and modernist theories of ethnogenesis	['SDG16']

10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.10.056	Moving beyond the historical quagmire of measuring infant mortality for the First Nations population in Canada	AbstractInfant mortality is a metric influenced by societal, political and medical advances. The way vital events are collected and reported are not always uniform. A lack of uniformity has disadvantaged some groups in society. In Canada, a multi-jurisdictional vital statistics system has truncated our ability to produce infant mortality rates for the Indigenous population. To understand how this evolved, this paper outlines the history of infant mortality, generally and internationally, and then documents the efforts to harmonize the collection and reporting of vital statistics (births and deaths) in Canada. Following this analysis is a historical review of vital event reporting for Canada's Indigenous population. A major finding of this paper is that racism, reframing, and jurisdictional posturing has limited our ability to accurately estimate live births and infant deaths for the Indigenous population. To improve Indigenous infant mortality estimation, Canada's governments need to transcend multijurisdictional challenges and fulfill international reporting obligations to Indigenous communities	['SDG16']

In this article we assess the moral dimension of the targeted killing of Islamist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011. An analysis of the case concludes that the episode was based on a Dirty Hands judgement by President Obama. The ‘Problem of Dirty Hands’ entails that, for a political actor, sometimes it is right to do what is wrong. Established by Michael Walzer in 1973, the problem was applied to the policy of the targeted killing of terrorist associates by political philosopher Stephen de Wijze. It is believed to provide a viable agent-centric framework to assess intractable moral conflicts while neither allowing for ruthless amoralism nor ignoring the nature of the political office. The conditions outlined by de Wijze are holistically fulfilled and, thus, it is concluded that, from a Dirty Hands’ perspective, the targeted killing of al-Awlaki was a justified breach of important moral standards.</jats:p	['SDG16']

It allows us to suggest that one of the transition channels through which corruption has impacted growth is entrepreneurship. The main channels in which corruption impacts entrepreneurship is through reduced incentives for entrepreneurial activity and reduced trust within the system. The authors present evidence that the negative impact of an incremental increase in the level of corruption on entrepreneurship is more harmful in developed countries than in developing countries. Thus, they stress the need for more research in this area with the aim of establishing appropriate frameworks for the fight of corruption in both developing and developed countries and suggest significant gains from anti-corruption efforts, especially in developed countries.</jats:p	['SDG16']
10.1080/02589346.2015.1104465	Regionalism Revised: A Critical-reflectivist Framework for Engaging the Changing Nature of Developing Regionalisms in Africa	The purpose of this article is a theoretical one, namely to make the case for a critical-reflectivist approach to the study of regionalism in Africa and beyond. We argue that contemporary changes in the global political economy require political economists to reconsider how we study regional processes and actors. The article provides insights into the sociology of the field of study by recounting its evolution, reviewing key debates and tracing the dominance of rationalist theories on regional integration and regionalism. Subsequently, the article questions the ontological premises of state-centrism and market logics in conventional regional theorization that does not take account of the complexities and multidimensionality of regions and regional processes. Traditional approaches to regionalism fail to do justice to regional manifestations and the repercussions of Africa's changing transnational relations as well as to crucial dynamics within regional civil societies. In this respect, the analytical value of both Robert W. Cox's World Order Approach (WOA) and the New Regionalism(s) Approach (NRA) for challenging the theoretical hegemony in the field of study is elaborated on. The theoretical framework proposed in this article points to neglected dimensions of regionalization and stresses both structural factors as well as the myriad of regional actors and their respective regional strategies as drivers of the changing nature of developing regionalisms in Africa. The authors' claim that regionalism is everything but a ‘states only’ domain is substantiated by the proposed conceptualization of regional civil society, a persistent analytical ‘blind spot’ in the study of regionalism. Drawing eclectically on the WOA and the NRA, the article provides a theoretical ‘entry-point’ for the analytical incorporation of regional civil societies into the political economy of African regionalisms. The article concludes by arguing that analytical and theoretical sensitivity to potentially transformative societal actors and processes at the regional level becomes increasingly relevant in the context of shared experiences of neoliberal globalization/regionalization as well as of Africa's new ‘partnerships’ with emerging powers	['SDG16']

10.1017/cbo9781139871440	Leo strauss man of peace	Leo Strauss is known to many people as a thinker of the right, who inspired hawkish views on national security and perhaps advocated war without limits. Moving beyond gossip and innuendo about Strauss's followers and the Bush administration, this book provides the first comprehensive analysis of Strauss's writings on political violence, considering also what he taught in the classroom on this subject. In stark contrast to popular perception, Strauss emerges as a man of peace, favorably disposed to international law and skeptical of imperialism - a critic of radical ideologies who warns of the dangers to free thought and civil society when intellectuals ally themselves with movements that advocate violence. Robert Howse provides new readings of Strauss's confrontation with fascist/Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, his debate with Alexandre Kojève about philosophy and tyranny, and his works on Machiavelli and Thucydides and examines Strauss's lectures on Kant's Perpetual Peace and Grotius's Rights of War and Peace.</jats:p	['SDG16']
10.1111/1468-2346.12502	The unintended consequences of emergency food aid: Neutrality, sovereignty and politics in the Syrian civil war, 2012-15	This is the author accepted manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2346.12502This paper dissects the role of emergency food aid during the current Syrian conflict.  Drawing on Autesserre’s concept of frames and Agamben’s theory of sovereignty, we argue that the neutrality frame, which undergirds the majority of humanitarian relief efforts in Syria, obfuscates emergency food aid’s impact, both on sovereign power relations and local political dynamics. Through close scrutiny of various case studies, we trace how humanitarian efforts reinforce the bases of sovereign politics while contributing to a host of what Pandolfi (1998) terms “mobile sovereignties.” We then analyze how and why ostensibly neutral emergency food aid has unintentionally assisted the Assad regime by facilitating its control over food, which it uses to buttress support and foster compliance. The article concludes by examining the political and military impact of emergency food aid during Syria’s war before discussing possible implications for the humanitarian enterprise more broadly	['SDG16']

Situated in human rights and utilizing the lens of transnational feminist discourse which addresses globalization and the hegemonic, monolithic portrayals of “third world” women as passive and in need of the global North's intervention, the authors explore the ways in which the use of digital media provides increased access to books, and other texts and applications in both English and native languages for people in developing countries. However, while advances in combating illiteracy through the use of e-readers, mobile phones and other mobile learning initiatives are promising, the tensions and power imbalances of digital literacies, which resources are available by whom, for whom and why, must also be examined. </jats:p	['SDG16']
10.3390/rel7020016	Religious groups as interest groups: The united states catholic bishops in the welfare reform debate of 1995–1996 and the health care reform debate of 2009–2010	The United States has a long history of religious influence on public policy: the anti-slavery movement, progressivism, prohibition, civil rights, abortion, school vouchers, school prayer and nuclear disarmament are all issues that have involved religion and religious groups in policymaking. In recent decades, the number of religious interest groups (as well as interest groups in general) has greatly expanded, but the role that the religious organizations play as interest groups in the policy arena has received relatively little attention. How are they similar to and different from other interest groups? What tactics do they use? How successful are they? Under what conditions is success or failure more likely? This article examines Roman Catholic religious groups as interest groups in the congressional policymaking process. First, it places Catholic interest groups in the context of the interest group literature, and second, it examines Catholic interest groups’ activity in the passage of welfare reform in 1996 and in the passage of health care reform in 2010. In both cases, they played a greater role in context-setting than in actually changing provisions	['SDG16']

Local community perceptions of recreational activities in peri-urban national parks	Increased pressure to allow more recreational activities in peri-urban national parks may impact local communities. We surveyed residents living in local communities near six peri-urban national parks (IUCN Category II) in Queensland, Australia. We assessed their sense of place, their perceptions of different types of visitors’ activities, and interactions between attitudes and perceptions. Most respondents, including national park users and non-users, perceived non-motorised recreational activities as appropriate but perceived motorised activities negatively. Overall, negative perceptions were related to a respondent's sense of place. Respondents with a stronger sense of place had more positive perceptions of non-motorised activities but more negative perceptions of motorised activities than respondents reporting a weaker sense of place. Results suggest that people identifying with their local national park may have a small ‘latitude of acceptance’ for motorised activities. We found limited displacement due to recreational conflicts; most respondents still visited these parks. The methods used here, if applied to other peri-urban national parks, could help determine a local community's recreational activity thresholds, offering park managers a way to potentially diminish conflict and enhance visitors’ experiences.Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentFull Tex	['SDG16']

10.4324/9781315879871	Characterization and systemic gender violence: The example of Laundry and the figure of the mother in Irish culture	Following the breakdown of Yugoslavia, in the early 1990s, the besieged city of Sarajevo, pieced together through news reports and images, entered our living rooms and our imaginations. Sarajevo became a synecdoche of the conflict in Bosnia and the iconic site of war and suffering. Theatrical terminology was frequently used in the local media to describe the war as ‘theatre of cruelty’ and ‘theatre of the absurd’, while ‘Waiting for Godot’ became the favourite metaphor for the position of citizens in the besieged city. These performance metaphors have seldom been further explored, hence they did not do much more than contribute to the framing of Sarajevo as a site of passive suffering, mute and frozen in its historical paralysis (Wertenbaker 2001), while mediated through voices of politicians, journalists and Western intellectuals. Nevertheless, there was something intuitively correct in this toying with performance metaphors to describe the various dimensions of the war	['SDG16']

10.1007/s40802-016-0055-0	General Principles of Public Order and Morality and the Domain Name System: Whither Public International Law?	This article discusses the dispute settlement procedure set up by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to assess whether applied-for generic top-level domain names (gTLDs) are contrary to accepted legal norms of morality and public order that are recognised under general principles of international law. The standard of general principles of international law for morality and public order exemplifies the introduction of a legal yardstick to assess gTLDs. First, the article argues that this standard was carefully crafted to fulfil, in theory, the goals of the settlement procedure. In practice, however, it is unclear whether such general principles are apt to articulate, in a legal form, the norms of public order and morality. Second, the article demonstrates that the expert panels adopted different approaches in deciding the cases brought before them either by prioritising the protection of the users' health online over freedom of expression or by focusing on preserving freedom of expression under the human rights paradigm. The expert panels construed their mandates differently and implicitly applied different concepts and bodies of public international law into their framing of a new area of regulation. The analysis underlines that one should be cautious when conceptualising and balancing competing interests in the domain name space, such as, on the one hand, the availability of information online and economic considerations and, on the other, the accommodation of public interest concerns in the Internet's root zone. The article concludes by emphasising that international law is not a panacea for highly debatable policy issues in Internet governance.Scopu	['SDG16']

The article reflects on the tensions that arise as a result of the growing influence of business norms within health funding alongside what critics have termed the ‘scientization’ of global health, and it considers the gendered implications of these developments. It is argued that it is due to the under-valuation and marginalization of community-based work that provides spaces for women's voices in the design and delivery of health interventions that large-scale ‘technical’ interventions receive priority. The article examines what this means in terms of NGOs’ ability to work towards producing transformative change around gender — and indeed racial — equality	['SDG16']

10.1080/09540121.2016.1178954	Access for all: contextualising HIV treatment as prevention in Swaziland	This article explores how notions of the individual and population are evoked in two ongoing HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) implementation studies in Swaziland. By contrasting policy discourses with lived kinship experiences of people living with HIV, we seek to understand how TasP unfolds in the Swazi context. Data collection consisted of eight focus group discussions with people living with HIV who were members of support groups to examine their perspectives about TasP. In addition, 18 key informant interviews were conducted with study team members, national-level policy-makers and NGO representatives involved in the design of health communication messages about TasP in Swaziland. Thematic analysis was used to identify recurrent themes in transcripts and field notes. Policy-makers and people living with HIV actively resisted framing HIV treatment as a prevention technology but promoted it as (earlier) access to treatment for all. TasP was not conceptualised in terms of individual or societal benefits, which are characteristic of international public health debates; rather its locally situated meanings were embedded in kinship experiences, concerns about taking responsibility for one’s own health and others, local biomedical knowledge about drug resistance, and secrecy. The findings from this study suggest that more attention is needed to understand how the global discourse of TasP becomes shaped in practice in different cultural contexts	['SDG16']

10.1080/13691457.2016.1206850	Social work and the penal state	The Criminal Justice System (CJS) has historically been a key site of social work intervention. Wacquant (2008, 2009a and 2009b) argues that the growth of social insecurity and the expansion of the penal state are endogenous features of the neo-liberal political project.  The key premises of neo-liberalism have been accepted by parties of both the left and the right. Wacquant identifies that the “doxa” of the penal state such as “prison works” “zero tolerance” and “broken windows” have been widely accepted in an uncritical fashion. This shift alongside an increase in inequality had led to increasing social anxiety and mistrust. One manifestation of these trends is the “decline of the rehabilitative ideal” (Garland, 2001).  Offenders, who were once generally viewed as marginalised individuals in need of social and welfare support are now regarded as sites of risk. The USA has led a penal arms race, in which, the use of imprisonment has grown significantly. In Europe, England and Wales has followed this trend most closely. Whilst acknowledging that penal policy is the result of a complex inter-relationship between social, cultural and historical factors, there are lessons to be learnt from the US experience. These include the impact of race and class inequalities as manifest in the CJS. The act of imprisonment is arguably an act of state violence and alongside the impact on individuals, communities and families, it has huge symbolic significance and value. The expansion of the penal state: the increasing numbers, poor conditions and the over-representation of minority groups mean that it should be a core social work concern.  The paper outlines the ways, in which, risk and managerialism have sidelined core social work values in the CJS. It concludes that developments in the USA, particularly the decision in Brown v. Plata  highlight a way out of the current impasse. Penal policy and conditions can only be reformed if the inherent dignity of offenders is rediscovered and placed at its centre	['SDG16']

Little is known regarding men’s perspectives of approaches that challenge inequitable gender norms, particularly in settings impacted by armed conflict. This article describes men’s experiences with a women’s empowerment program and highlights men’s perceptions of gender norms, poverty and armed conflict, as they relate to achieving programmatic goals. Data are from 32 Ivorian men who participated in indepth interviews in 2012. Interviews were undertaken as part of an intervention that combined gender dialogue groups for both women and their male partners with women’s only village savings and loans programs to reduce IPV against women. Findings suggested that in the context of armed conflict, traditional gender norms and economic stressors experienced by men challenged fulfillment of gender roles and threatened men’s sense of masculinity. Men who participated in gender dialogue groups discussed their acceptance of programming and identified improvements in their relationships with their female partners. These men further discussed increased financial planning along with their partners, and attributed such increases to the intervention. Addressing men’s perceptions of masculinity, poverty and armed conflict may be key components to reduce men’s violence against women in conflict-affected settings	['SDG16']

PurposeStrategic race‐blindness (purposely avoiding mention of a target's ethnicity to appear unprejudiced) potentially hinders eyewitness testimony.Design/methodology/approachThe current study examined whether participant and interviewer race affected the recollection of black, white or Western Asian individuals, where it was indicated the targets were criminal or not. Data were gathered using a cognitive interview‐type methodology whereby stimulus questioning was open, rather than prompted. After a short interval participants spontaneously described the targets and the point at which race was used as a descriptor was noted.FindingsThere was a clear effect of differential race mentioning in free recall by participants. However, multi‐level ordinal logistic regression found neither race of the interviewer nor race of the participant (or their interaction) influenced the mentioning of the race of the face in the photograph. This remained irrespective of the guilt of the person in the stimulus picture.Originality /valueExtending the paradigm to persons of Western Asian heritage enabled strategic race bias to be considered in the context of persons sometimes regarded as being sympathetic to terrorism. Gathering information using the cognitive interview makes out study closer to the process by which the police in the UK are trained to gather information.</jats:sec	['SDG16']
10.1017/s2047102516000236	The Use of 'Macro' Legal Analysis in the Understanding and Development of Global Environmental Governance	AbstractThis article examines the manner in which ‘macro’ legal analysis can potentially assist in overcoming some of the issues that are faced in the understanding and development of global environmental governance (GEG). It argues that the analysis of law through separate and distinct disciplines – such as environmental law, trade law, corporate law, and human rights law – results in what this article refers to as ‘micro’ legal analysis. As such, it contends that this can have the effect of creating obstacles in the development of coherent and effective legal and policy choices related to the protection of the environment. It illustrates these arguments with examples of practical problems that have arisen from the separation of legal issues in practice and provides the theoretical underpinnings, based on the critique of international lawyers, for the application of ‘macro’ legal analysis. In other words, it argues for a form of analysis that would consider the entire range of relevant legal disciplines in a unitary process. It then provides a methodology for the development and application of ‘macro’ legal analysis in relation to environmental issues. Finally, it considers the potential that this approach could have within the field of GEG and comments on the implications that it could have for the way in which lawyers are trained in the future.</jats:p	['SDG16']

In order to do so, it analyses Schiller’s arguments through the lenses of two ideas which are usually exposed to misinterpretations, namely “abstraction” and “violence”. Rather than signalling a basic opposition, these two ideas turn out to be the best key to understanding Schiller’s core agreement with Kant as far as the role of natural feelings in moral life is concerned. A moral agent must abstract from human drives and cannot but exert violence back on them. Nor can even taste change any of this, for taste itself ultimately rests on the violence of civility	['SDG16']

Critics (e.g., Foucault 1977) have concentrated their efforts on demonstrating that the ends achieved in the design of prisons and methods of correction have had effects outside of the prison walls in the daily lives of free and innocent citizens, both in the loss of privacy due to increased police surveillance and in the creation of a population of criminals and personnel of the criminal justice system in an integrated culture. Whether we view a society regimented by a uniform ideology like the Soviet Union or one with a less systematic one like the USA, the effects are clear. This paper examines the practice and ideology of prisons, in historical context and in cross-cultural analysis. Worldwide incarceration of people takes up an increasing amount of state budgets and targets in many cases minorities or ethnic groups. This has economic effects on society at large and specifically those minorities as well as repressing the incomes of sectors of cities. Public health is impacted as is education and inequality enhanced. Prisons and punishment differ historically in the same culture and between cultures. The goal of punishment and discipline in society has many forms, to control certain populations, to enrich others and to define certain behaviors and people as dangerous. Inevitably we want to know, can we do without prisons in complex society? Is our system of punishment accelerating the collapse of social capital in America and social cohesion	['SDG16']

Building on the understanding of social justice in adult education as a complex phenomenon, two indicators are developed: an index of inclusion and an index of fairness in participation in adult education. The article analyses social justice separately in formal and nonformal education for two social groups—people with low and high education. Using data from the Adult Education Survey from 2007 and 2011 for 25 countries, it is shown that in most of the countries, there are signs of improvement in the fairness aspect of social justice as a result of a decrease in the overrepresentation of people with high education and in the underrepresentation of people with low education. However, the inclusion of people with low education in adult education remains considerable lower in comparison with the inclusion of people with high education	['SDG16']

The article analyzes three specific areas: the state’s attitude to regulating German business, meeting international anticorruption commitments, and doing justice to the rising transparency agenda. High-profile examples of corruption in multinational businesses prompted significant changes to these companies’ compliance regimes. This critical juncture, however, did not prompt reform across much of the Mittelstand. Germany’s preparedness to fulfill international commitments, meanwhile, has been strongly dependent on correspondence with the internal logic of German politics and law. Where this was not so and in the absence of any critical junctures, change has been infrequent. Finally, the rise of an international transparency agenda has not fit with the logics of German public life, and change has been minimal. Thus, despite a strong anticorruption record, German elites would benefit from proactively thinking about where corruption lurks and what could be don	['SDG16']

Three theoretically relevant patterns of institutional adaptation are unearthed: first, limited resources for state capture do indeed trigger self-limitation initiatives as expected, but these initiatives replace costly benefits with less costly ones. Second, different forms of capture have different implications for the terms of political competition. Third, there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between clientelism and corruption, which becomes pronounced in the creative ways by which strategies of capture adjust to shifting opportunities and constraints. Clients are appointed in state offices and extract bribes directly from citizens. ‘Client corruption’ replaces extraction from the state with extraction through the state, which is less costly for the public finances: the benefit the governing party gives to its clients is the ‘right’ to extract rents for themselves	['SDG16']
10.1415/84929	Immigration and the State: An ethical issue	In the last decades, an ethical debate on the question of the state's power to regulate immigration has taken place in the Anglo-Saxon academic world. In this article, I expose the different positions held in that debate and make some remarks on the open borders position. My points are the following: the arguments for the open borders position imply the illigitimacy of the state, and the actualization of such a position would probably cause the weakening and, eventually, the collapse of either the state or democracy; at present, economical and financial global power - instead of supranational institutions able to provide global justice and to protect human rights - are taking advantage from the weakening of states	['SDG16']
10.1177/0032321716647401	Compensating for Climate Change Loss and Damage	With the adoption of the Warsaw International Mechanism in 2013, the international community recognised that anthropogenic climate change will result in a range of adverse effects despite policies of mitigation and adaptation. Addressing these climatic ‘losses and damages’ is now a key dimension of international climate change negotiations. This article presents a normative framework for thinking about loss and damage designed to inform, and give meaning to, these negotiations. It argues that policies addressing loss and damage, particularly those targeting developing countries, should respect norms of compensatory justice which aim to make victims of unwarranted climatic disruptions ‘whole again’. The article develops a typology of different kinds of climate change disruption and uses it to (1) explain the differences between ‘losses’ and ‘damages’, (2) assign priorities among compensatory measures seeking to address loss and damage and (3) explore a range of equitable responses to loss and damage	['SDG16']

10.1017/9781316875582	The politics of bureaucratic corruption in posttransitional eastern Europe	Using a mix of ethnographic, survey, and comparative historical methodologies, this book offers an unprecedented insight into the corruption economies of Ukrainian and Belarusian universities, hospitals, and secondary schools. Its detailed analysis suggests that political turnover in hybrid political regimes has a strong impact on petty economic crime in service-provision bureaucracies. Theoretically, the book rejects the dominant paradigm that attributes corruption to the allegedly ongoing political transition. Instead, it develops a more nuanced approach that appreciates the complexity of corruption economies in non-Western societies, embraces the local meanings and functions of corruption, and recognizes the stability of new post-transitional regimes in Eastern Europe and beyond. This book offers a critical look at the social costs of transparency, develops a blueprint for a &amp;apos;sociology of corruption&amp;apos;, and offers concrete and feasible policy recommendations. It will appeal to scholars across the social sciences, policymakers and a variety of anti-corruption and social justice activists.</jats:p	['SDG16']

It is a social change movement that promotes local production, recognizes the importance of community, and rejects notions of individual entitlement to more than a fair share. It seeks to create ecologically and socially sustainable systems, thus combatting environmental degradation and addressing climate change. In this chapter we report on interviews with permaculturalists and explore the lived experience of permaculture and its relevance to ecosocial transition. Drawing from our experience as social workers, we pose that a partnership approach between social work and permaculture is needed to advance ecosocial transition.Griffith Health, School of Human Services and Social WorkNo Full Tex	['SDG16']

The author’s aim is to analy-ze some of the potential risks these young people face on their journey. The study is based on documentary sources and interviews with male and female teens between the ages of 14 and 17 from Southern and Central Mexico, who were housed at a Tamaulipas Center for the Care of Border Minors. Specifically, the study deals with risks such as being the possible victims of the region’s organized crime, contacting coyotes (human smugglers), being taken by them to “safe houses,” crossing the Rio Grande, and, finally, being detained by Border Patrol agents.Este trabajo reporta parte de los resultados de un estudio antropológico realizado con menores migrantes mexicanos repatriados de Estados Unidos por la frontera entre Tamaulipas y Texas.

This paper highlights the difficulties confronting journalists in Kyrgyzstan, who face a number of problems, including poor rates of pay, little or no ethical training, and a situation in which they, and the media organizations they work for, are prepared to receive payment for covering or declining to cover a story. The result: envelopes containing cash are seen as an acceptable way of supplementing journalistic incomes. The study involves in-depth qualitative interviews with 27 journalists in Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan, from 4 to 23 January 2016. The author concludes that while it would be almost impossible to remove the practices identified above, universities could play an important role in helping new generations of reporters overcome such temptations by including more ethics in the journalism curriculum. </jats:p	['SDG16']
10.1017/s0260210514000175	The politics of inclusion: Changing patterns in the governance of international security	AbstractThe debate on the reform of the Security Council can be conceptualised as the most recent episode in the evolution of World Governing Councils (WGCs), that is, the highest-level intergovernmental bodies charged with regulating the international use of violence. Building on a historical comparison of key formative and transformative moments – 1815, 1919, 1945, and post-Cold War – we argue that the modern evolution of WGCs is characterised by increasing inclusiveness. More specifically, we show that the number of participants involved in deliberations has constantly risen; that legitimating principles have gradually tilted in favour of ‘input legitimacy’; that the constitutive rules and procedures have steadily gained in transparency; and that the WGCs themselves have comprised an expanding membership with a decreasing number of veto points. At the theoretical level, these converging trends can be explained by the existence of a ‘ratchet effect’ whereby new norms and practices of inclusion accumulate over time. However concrete and long lasting, the democratic gains registered in the process must be cast in terms of historically specific politics and struggles rather than in terms of lofty ideals promoted by altruistic norm entrepreneurs.</jats:p	['SDG16']

Rather than point to the lack of oversight of individuals in bank compliance roles, as many commentators do, in this paper I examine in depth the organizational context that surrounded people in such roles. I focus on those compliance personnel who did speak out about risky practices in their banks, who were forced to escalate the problem and 'whistle-blow' to external parties, and who were punished for doing so. Drawing on recent empirical data from a wider study, I argue that the concept of dependence corruption is useful in this setting, and that it can be extended to encompass interpersonal attachments. This, in turn, problematises the concept of dependence corruption because interpersonal attachments in organisational settings are inevitable. The paper engages with recent debates on whether institutional corruption is an appropriate lens for studying private-sector organisations by arguing for a focus on roles, rather than remaining at the level of institutional fields or individual organisations. Finally, the paper contributes to studies on banking compliance in the context of the recent crisis; without a deeper understanding of those who were forced to extremes to simply do their jobs, reform of the banking sector will prove difficult.With thanks to NUI Galway Ireland’s Millennium Fund, and to all participants in this  researchpeer-reviewe	['SDG16']

This essay situates both versions in relation to contemporary sociological and popular discourses of state violence and racial liberalism. A pervasive midcentury ideology posited that rationalizing state violence could resolve both social disorder and racial injustice. I argue that Yesterday’s representation of the excessiveness of prison violence undermines the state’s claims to rationality and moderation and that the book’s exploration of queer, criminalized, and racialized subjectivity resists the pathologizing discourses that legitimized state violence. The novel’s transformation did not merely excise its sexual content, then, but greatly diminished its political disruptiveness. Cast the First Stone labors to contain the “extreme sense of protest” that Yesterday dramatizes so powerfully.</jats:p	['SDG16']

In contrast, little is known about the controllee-centric factors that may influence the effectiveness of control activities. Drawing on institutional theory, the purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of control legitimacy to the ISD literature – a concept that past organizational research has linked to outcomes such as employee commitment and performance. Specifically, the authors explore how different dimensions of control activities (mode, degree, style) relate to controllee perceptions of control legitimacy in terms of justice, autonomy, group identification, and competence development.   Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with 20 practitioners across three companies. A structured data coding approach was employed and analysis was conducted within and across each case study.   Findings The authors find that the control degree and control style can help explain control legitimacy perceptions better than control modes alone. For example, the results suggest that formal controls enacted in a bilateral style correspond with higher perceptions of justice and autonomy, when compared to formal controls enacted in a unilateral style.   Originality/value The study results imply that ISD managers should be increasingly mindful of enacting controls in a way that is perceived to be legitimate by subordinates, thereby potentially enhancing both staff well-being and ISD performance. </jats:sec	['SDG16']

Justice, reconciliation and democracy in post-genocide Rwanda - Challenges to Public Theology	Abstract How can a public theology advance the task of democracy in order to bring forth justice for all? This article focuses on post-genocide Rwanda as a current example of a country’s quest for justice, reconciliation and democratization after severe violent conflict. The first part traces the historical background of the Rwandan genocide with specific attention on the lack of just and democratic structures in pre-genocide Rwanda and the roles of the Christian churches therein. The second part explores the Christian churches’ involvement in the country’s current reconciliation process. Here, the Presbyterian Church of Rwanda (EPR) serves as a case study. The third part critically assesses the churches’ contribution to reconciliation with regards to how it serves to enhance—or hinder—the implementation of just and democratic structures.</jats:p	['SDG16']

Reflections on Black geographies and the limits of dialogue	This commentary uses the Black Geographies Symposium, held at UC Berkeley from October 11-12, 2017, as a point of departure to discuss the political and intellectual limits of calls for dialogue. We focus specifically on the historical exclusion of Black scholars and Black thought from human geography and understand the academy as a site for the reproduction of epistemic violence against women and people of color. Calls for dialogue within the academy that neglect to consider historically sedimented power relations—including human geography’s own entanglement with colonialism and racism—therefore commit the grave error of substituting equity for true justice. We argue instead for nonhierarchical and nonlinear modes of study that can attend to the complex geographical itineraries and interconnected struggles that continue to shape our understandings of the relations of capitalism, racism, and sexism structuring the modern world. Specifically, an intellectual praxis that begins from a place of Black humanness can enable us to tap into a wider epistemological network, one that refutes cursory lip service to Black scholarship and engages deeply with its consequences for our political and intellectual interactions. </jats:p	['SDG16']
10.4000/sdt.1727	Classifying populations in health services: Practical reasons and discretion	Comment le travail de santé fabrique-t-il de l’inégalité ? L’article vise à expliciter les pratiques de classement des agents de santé publique et à dévoiler les formes de travail discrétionnaire à l’œuvre dans leur travail. Sur le terrain du dépistage du sida, les individus consultent tous pour le même motif, dans un cadre de consultation anonyme et gratuit. Celui-ci permet d’observer comment des soignants classent les usagers des services de santé dans des catégories de classe, de genre, sexuelles, « raciales », et différencient leur offre de biens de santé face à une demande identique. L’enquête, qui combine analyse d’archives associatives, analyse quantitative, entretiens avec des agents du dépistage et observation de leur travail dans des centres de dépistage publics et associatifs, met en évidence une faible prise en compte des appartenances de genre et de classe, et une racialisation des catégories sexuelles : seuls les hommes blancs sont interrogés sur leur (homo)sexualité et reçoivent des informations plus personnalisées, quand les femmes et les hommes non-blancs sont supposés hétérosexuels, et reçoivent dès lors des conseils plus standardisés, sauf lorsque les agents recueillent des informations biographiques plus précises au cours de consultations plus longues.How can providing health services generate inequality? This paper seeks to clarify the classifications practised by public health workers and to reveal the forms of discretionary practice implicit in their work. In a free and anonymous AIDS screening setting, everyone is present for the same reason. This makes it possible to observe how health service providers divide their clients into social categories such as class, gender, sexuality and race and offer different service responses to an essentially identical demand. The research analyses NGO archives, quantitative data and interviews with health workers, as well as observation of their work in public and at NGO screening centres. It shows that gender and class affiliations receive little attention, whereas racial and sexual categories are of prime importance. Only white men are asked about their (homo)sexuality and receive more personalised information. Women and non-white men are presumed to be heterosexual, and therefore receive more standardised advice, unless health workers obtain more accurate biographical information during longer consultations	['SDG16']
10.1177/1741659016676864	Cultural confessions: Law and the racial scrutiny of the Indo-Canadian home in Metro Vancouver	In Metro Vancouver, the recurrence of gang violence involving young South Asian men has spawned a series of public explanations about a new threat to public safety: the ‘Indo-Canadian gangster’. This article explicates the racial force of a specific exposé on the putatively ‘cultural’ origins of the Indo-Canadian gangster which identifies the domestic realm of the city’s South Asian populations as the principal cause of this gang violence. By tracking the trajectories of this exposé and other texts that take similar confessional forms, this article provides important insight into the differential capacity of texts to attract public attention and to persuade, by virtue of the narrative forms they assume as well as the semantic content of the knowledges they mobilize. On the one hand, this article documents the tropes of cultural inertia that characterize public knowledges of the ‘Indo-Canadian home’, which is configured as a domestic space that is culturally insulated from putatively Western norms of civility and legality. On the other hand, it explains how this exposé acquires its epistemic force from the confessional form of the knowledges it circulates, which acts as a mechanism of cultural interpellation for South Asian actors who are positioned to renounce and disavow the pathologies of Indo-Canadian culture. </jats:p	['SDG16']

Despite recent efforts to rejuvenate subregional cooperation on hydroelectric projects, interviews with policymakers in India, Bangladesh and Nepal have revealed that significant obstacles exist towards the realization of these projects, key among which are environmental issues which are often related to political challenges. Using data collected from fieldwork in three South Asian countries, this article argues that an environmental peacebuilding approach can adequately resolve some of the impediments to the realization of the proposed hydroelectric projects in the GBM basin. Such an approach can also reduce regional conflicts and incentivize integration. To this effect, the article attempts to invigorate innovative policies by outlining a framework for cooperation on hydroelectric projects which is underpinned by environmental peacebuilding mechanisms. The article also contributes to existing literature on environmental peacebuilding by analysing how hegemonic dominance can be a significant obstruction to the wider conceptualization of peace and how such obstacles can be overcome	['SDG16']

This newfound focus on informal urbanism in the North is a welcome development, but, taken as a whole, Northern literature concerning informality is characterized by conceptual imprecision and an indeterminate analysis of the politics of informal actions and actors. As such, it fails to provide meaningful guidance to planners concerned with urban poverty, social justice, equity, and inclusion. This article attempts to resolve some of these problems by focusing on one key area of conceptual slippage in the literature: the failure to differentiate between informality born of desire and that born of need. This results in a flattened analysis of the political ramifications of informal actions and the political subjectivity of informal actors. In this article, I review the existing literature in order to point out some of these shortcomings. I then suggest that planners in the North have much to learn about informal urbanism from their counterparts working in and on Southern cities. I attempt to reconcile these two bodies of literature, arguing that Southern theory can help Northern planners develop a more nuanced, politically sophisticated approach to informal urbanism.</jats:p	['SDG16']

10.18042/cepc/redc114.04	Right to education: Normative lacks and problematic definitions at the argentine legislation	La Ley de Educación Nacional (2006) regula el ejercicio del derecho a la educación en Argentina. Constituye el piso federal sobre el cual la legislación de las provincias debe establecer sus regulaciones específicas en el marco del Estado federal argentino. En este trabajo se problematiza el alcance del derecho a la educación a luz de la teoría de los derechos fundamentales a efectos de precisar sus implicancias para la definición de las políticas educativas. En primer lugar, se cuestiona qué supone este derecho en términos de contenidos, alcance y exigibilidad. En segundo lugar, se describe cómo es reglamentado por la legislación de Argentina y se discute su contenido a la luz de la extensión diferenciada (por la propia ley) de la obligatoriedad escolar, lo cual repercute en el plano de los estados provinciales. Finalmente, se presentan algunas reflexiones en relación con el rol del Estado nacional y las definiciones de políticas educativas.The National Education Act (2006) regulates the right of education in Argentina. It is the federal base on which each province should pass their specific legislation according to the Argentine federalism. This article traces and analyzes basic definitions regarding the meaning of the right to education from the human rights based approach in order to figure out its implications for public policies. Consequently, we start asking about what is meant by education as a right. Then, we describe the way in which Argentine national legislation regulates it. We focus on the differentiated extension of compulsory education designed by this legislation. Finally, we examine the uses of these categories to analyze the relationships between the National State and the educational policies.Fil: Ruiz, Guillermo Ramón.

Yet there is limited discussion of the impact of socially just dispositions. The present study critically examines the relationship between justice-oriented mind-sets in preservice teachers and their perceptions of teaching in urban schools. Using critical interpretive case study, we analyze a series of journal reflections from a diverse group of prospective teachers to determine whether exposure to service-learning opportunities within an urban school influenced their views about urban schools and students. As a result of the findings from the study, recommendations for teacher education are addressed. </jats:p	['SDG16']

10.1093/oso/9780190699994.001.0001	Inside the enemy’s computer: Identifying cyber attackers	Attribution — tracing those responsible for a cyber attack — is of primary importance when classifying it as a criminal act, an act of war, or an act of terrorism. Three assumptions dominate current thinking: attribution is a technical problem; it is unsolvable; and it is unique. Approaching attribution as a problem forces us to consider it either as solved or unsolved. Yet attribution is far more nuanced, and is best approached as a process in constant flux, driven by judicial and political pressures. In the criminal context, courts must assess the guilt of criminals, mainly based on technical evidence. In the national security context, decision-makers must analyze unreliable and mainly non-technical information in order to identify an enemy of the state. Attribution in both contexts is political: in criminal cases, laws reflect society’s prevailing norms and powers; in national security cases, attribution reflects a state’s will to maintain, increase or assert its power. However, both processes differ on many levels. The constraints, which reflect common aspects of many other political issues, constitute the structure of the book: the need for judgment calls, the role of private companies, the standards of evidence, the role of time, and the plausible deniability of attacks.</p	['SDG16']
10.1525/hsns.2018.48.5.637	An episode in the history of precrime	This article traces the rise of “predictive” attitudes to crime prevention. After a brief summary of the current spread of predictive policing based on person-centered and place-centered mathematical models, an episode in the scientific study of future crime is examined. At UCLA between 1969 and 1973, a well-funded “violence center” occasioned great hopes that the quotient of human “dangerousness”—potential violence against other humans—could be quantified and thereby controlled. At the core of the center, under the direction of interrogation expert and psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West, was a project to gather unprecedented amounts of behavioral data and centrally store it to identify emergent crime. Protesters correctly seized on the violence center as a potential site of racially targeted experimentation in psychosurgery and an example of iatrogenic science. Yet the eventual spectacular failure of the center belies an ultimate success: its data-driven vision itself predicted the Philip K. Dick–style PreCrime policing now emerging. The UCLA violence center thus offers an alternative genealogy to predictive policing.

The HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council conducted four phase III and one phase IIb trials of women-initiated HIV prevention options in KwaZulu-Natal between 2003 and 2009. A total of 7046 women participated, with HIV prevalence between 25% and 45% and HIV incidence ranging from 4.5-9.1% per year. Unfortunately none of the interventions tested had any impact on reducing the risk of HIV acquisition; however, extremely valuable experience was gained, lessons learned and capacity built, while the communities gained associated benefits. Experience Our experience in conducting these trials ranged from setting up community partnerships to developing clinical research sites and dissemination of trial results. Community engagement included setting up community-based research sites with approval from both political and traditional leaders, and developing community advisory groups to assist with the research process. Community-wide education on HIV/sexually transmitted infection prevention, treatment and care was provided to over 90 000 individuals. Myths and misconceptions were addressed through methods such as anonymous suggestion boxes in clinic waiting areas and intensive education and counselling. Attempts were made to involve male partners to foster support and facilitate recruitment of women. Peer educator programmes were initiated to provide ongoing education and also to facilitate recruitment of women to the trials. Recruitment strategies such as door-to-door recruitment and community group meetings were initiated. Over 90% of women enrolled were retained. Community benefits from the trial included education on HIV prevention, treatment and care and provision of ancillary care (such as Pap smears, reproductive health care and referral for chronic illnesses). Social benefits included training of home-based caregivers and sustainable ongoing HIV prevention education through peer educator programmes. Challenges Several challenges were encountered, including manipulation by participants of their eligibility criteria in order to enroll in the trial. Women attempted to co-enroll in multiple trials to benefit from financial reimbursements and individualised care. The trials became ethically challenging when participants refused to take up referrals for care due to stigma, denial of their HIV status and inadequate health infrastructure. Lack of disclosure of HIV status to partners and family members was particularly challenging. Some of the ethical dilemmas put to the test our responsibility as researchers and our obligation to provide health care to research participants. Conclusion Conducting these five trials in a period of six years provided us with invaluable insights into trial implementation, community participation, recruitment and retention, provision of care and dissemination of trial results. The critical mass of scientists trained as clinical trialists will continue to address the relentless HIV epidemic in our setting and ensure our commitment to finding a biomedical HIV prevention option for women in the future.</p	['SDG17']

The Serviço Especial de Saúde Pública (SESP) built hundreds of small water supplies across Brazil from 1942 to 1991 with an extremely low failure rate. When it was evaluated in 1960, by a team of specialists from the International Cooperation Association (USAID's predecessor), they found a failure rate of less than 1%. The sustainability of SESP's water supply program can be attributed to five principles described here that can give guidance in future efforts to develop sustainable community water projects in low-income countries.</jats:p	['SDG17']

The 2008 reaeuthorization of PEPFAR embraced this challenge and committed to supporting the education and training of thousands of new health workers. In 2010 the program, with financial support from the US National Institutes of Health and administrative support from the Health Resources and Services Administration, launched the Medical Education Partnership Initiative to fund thirteen African medical schools and a US university. The US university would serve as a coordinating center to improve the quantity, quality, and retention of the schools\u27 graduates. The program was not limited to training in the delivery of services for patients with HIV/AIDS. Rather, it was based on the principle that investment in medical education and retention would lead to health system strengthening overall. Although results are limited at this stage, this article reviews the opportunities and challenges of the first year of this major transnational medical education initiative and considers directions for future efforts and reforms, national governmental roles, and the sustainability of the program over time. © 2012 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc	['SDG17']
10.1016/j.hcmf.2012.07.019	Adhering to the medical technology industry's code of conduct	Understanding and adhering to codes of conduct is important in healthcare. Collaboration is required to drive innovation and transform the healthcare system. Little is known about the industry—health system leaders/executives relationship. In Canada, the medical technology industry consults health system leaders to align business models with the health systems' needs, and understanding the implications of these fairly new relationships as related to ethics and codes of conduct. This research reflects agreement that ethical conduct and adherence to one's code of conduct or ethics is paramount. Any conflicts of interests can compromise public trust and inhibit much-needed public—private synergy. There is a high level of interest on the part of health system leaders to develop a more robust approach to reciprocally sharing and discussing codes of conduct. Opportunities are identified to improve both discussion and education. Instead of restricting industry, the focus should be on transparency and actively managing these relationships. Ethical and transparent partnerships are critical to the advancement of high-quality and cost-effective patient care. As health leaders are faced with the challenges of financial sustainability, efficiency, and quality, the medical technology industry can be instrumental in translating global best practices and supporting system innovations. </jats:p	['SDG17']

This article identifies the contributions that local government partnerships with cultural institutions—specifically public gardens—make to community development through their services, presence, and location in urban America. Using data from a national survey and 96 expert interviews of public garden and government officials, we explain why these alliances are forming, document their potential to improve communities, and suggest steps that local governments might take to benefit from this vital partner. Results expand our understanding of how nontraditional community development partners can provide resources to local governments to address urban challenges. </jats:p	['SDG17']

More specifically, the paper intends to examine partnering behaviour and management from a socio-political standpoint.                                           Design/methodology/approach                 – The case study approach used in the study utilised data from eight in-depth, semi-structured interviews, with managers from the business and NGO sectors engaged in a large-scale partnership between a Palestinian Cellular Corporation and an NGO. Interview transcripts were analysed using content and narrative analyses. Findings to be presented include reciprocity, corporate constitutionalism and utilitarianism.                                           Findings                 – The results found in this paper show that partnership has social, political, and ethical dimensions in support of the theoretical framework developed for this paper. More specifically, the results show that the studied partnership is an emergent process, fundamentally concerned with self-efficacy over community welfare, as well as being driven by individual organisational goals.                                           Originality/value                 – This paper sheds light on certain aspects of partnership that are often overlooked in mainstream research. It does not only highlight the multifaceted dimensions of partnering but also discusses how partnership can be envisioned and practised as inter-organisational relationships. It stimulates a pragmatic understanding of partnership nature and management showing that partnership emergence, direction and sustainability are conditioned by the stakeholders’ socio-political and ethical practices.             </jats:sec	['SDG17']

Findings                 – In the past decades, China's expanding engagement with Africa in the field of international development assistance has attracted great attention and given rise to mixed reactions and arguments at the international level. China's cooperation with Africa has a long and notable history, dating back to the 1950s. China's cooperation with other developing countries is known as South-South development cooperation, based on principles of equality, mutual benefit, solidarity and no conditionality. With a thorough and critical analysis of the decision-making mechanism and the practices of China's educational cooperation with Africa, this paper puts forward some important issues regarding the perspective of sustainability and effectiveness in Chinese cooperative arrangements.                                           Research limitations/implications                 – The paper tries to explain the dynamic and the practices of China's education engagement with Africa and puts forward key challenges regarding its effectiveness toward new strategic partnerships.

Despite increasing ""citizen participation"" in the discourse, there is very little debate on their socio-political implications. While some argue that ICT will enhance democratic debate and empower citizens [45, 18, 8], others concern about the development of Smart Cities ""without critical discussions and 'politics'"" [55, 5, 53] and notice the lack of attention for the politics of technical choices. This applies in particular to Smart Cities, since they require citizens to change behaviour according to quantitative targets and technological features. Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched its Smart City project in 2010. The government set specific criteria in order to ensure the ""participation of all the stakeholders"" (among which the citizens) and the ""lifestyle innovation"" [22]. The paper analyses information provided by semi-structured interviews to stakeholders of Japanese Smart Cities; the tools of citizen involvement proved effective in promoting cooperation and achieving significant outcomes in terms of energy consumption reductions, this involvement has not allowed any political debate about core issues such as Smart City, sustainability, and policies. METI and Japanese Smart Cities risk the potential for social innovation [7]. Research on behaviour change and sustainability also suggests that such situation is likely to hinder more significant shift towards sustainable lifestyles [56, 50]. Drawing on analysis of official documents as well as on interviews with each of the four Smart Communities' stakeholders, the paper explains that very little input is expected from Japanese citizens. Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of Smart Communities would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather to make them participate in the co-production of public services, mainly energy production and distribution"	['SDG17']

10.1186/s12913-016-1476-5	Unit cost analysis of training and deploying paid community health workers in three rural districts of Tanzania	"Tanzania, like other African countries, faces significant health workforce shortages. With advisory and partnership from Columbia University, the Ifakara Health Institute and the Tanzanian Training Centre for International Health (TTCIH) developed and implemented the Connect Project as a randomized cluster experimental trial of the childhood survival impact of recruiting, training, and deploying of a new cadre of paid community health workers (CHW), named ""Wawazesha wa afya ya Jamii"" (WAJA). This paper presents an estimation of the cost of training and deploying WAJA in three rural districts of Tanzania. Costing data were collected by tracking project activity expenditure records and conducting in-depth interviews of TTCIH staff who have led the training and deployment of WAJA, as well as their counterparts at Public Clinical Training Centres who have responsibility for scaling up the WAJA training program. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Register number ( ISRCTN96819844 ). The Connect training cost was US$ 2,489.3 per WAJA, of which 40.1 % was for meals, 20.2 % for accommodation 10.2 % for tuition fees and the remaining 29.5 % for other costs including instruction and training facilities and field allowance. A comparable training program estimated unit cost for scaling-up this training via regional/district clinical training centres would be US$ 833.5 per WAJA. Of this unit cost, 50.3 % would involve the cost of meals, 27.4 % training fees, 13.7 % for field allowances, 9 % for accommodation and medical insurance. The annual running cost of WAJA in a village will cost US$ 1.16 per capita. Costs estimated by this study are likely to be sustainable on a large scale, particularly if existing regional/district institutions are utilized for this program"	['SDG17']

10.1108/ijdrbe-07-2014-0056	An international comparative analysis of local hazard mitigation plan evaluation for flood: The USA, Japan and Korea	Purpose This research aims to identify the qualitative differences between local hazard mitigation plan (LHMP) of the developing country when compared to those of developed countries. It also seeks to demonstrate the relative importance of public private partnership and the need for PPs to be integrated into LHMP because they help to create strong LHMP, thereby making communities will become more resilient to not only floods but also other natural disasters. It focuses on the components of hazard mitigation from a developed country perspective and how these influence the contents/focus of the LHMP especially when compared to those of a developing country.   Design/methodology/approach Based on official information such as population, climate and major threat that has faced, research sites were selected. Each LHMP can be downloaded from the official city websites, except Korea. Through plan evacuation protocols the LHMP for each city – USA (Baltimore), Japan (Kumamoto) and Korea (Pohang) – were assessed three times by the research team. Plans were evaluated using a plan coding evacuation process.   Findings The LHMP of the developing country did not contain maps illustrating to the people who are exposed to flood and evacuation routes and who are vulnerable (both economically and physically), when compared with the developed countries plan. However, quicker response because of simple political hierarchy can be possible in Japan and Korea when compared to the USA, which has three different tiers of political governments – federal, State and Local government – though Korea is a developing country.   Originality/value In recent times, pre-disaster response, which is a proactive approach to natural disasters, is an emerging issue rather than post disaster response because of sustainable and resilient ideas of the locals that have repeatedly suffered from natural hazards. This study compares LHMPs of each country to better understand strengths and weakness, as well as to identify strategies that will enhance the quality of mitigation plan for the developed country and developing country. It is hoped that this study will inform and augment existing literature by assisting underdeveloped and developing countries suffering from floods with the preparation of their LHMPs based on the suggestion of this research. </jats:sec	['SDG17']

While now thoroughly urbanized, Europe today exhibits a very varied pattern of urban trajectories. After the destructions of World War II crucial decisions were made, both East and West, to maintain or restore the historical urban forms of Europe. Extensive urban planning and public control of land have made those intentions and a manageable growth a reality. The Cold War divide of Europe meant an urban iconographic division, not only in ideological content but also in symbolic form. In terms of living standards and vital demography, as well as legally and administratively, the distinctive European demarcation between town and country has largely disappeared, and governance issues are primarily local and regional, rather than urban or rural. Nevertheless, we find four new aspects of urban salience in the changing social configuration of Europe. The EU has stimulated urban networking and city acting, and the union has belatedly given an institutional recognition to cities. Urban renovation and information gathering are benefiting from EU support. While facing new challenges, of inter-cultural migration, economic inequality, and climate change in particular, European cities have rather successfully maintained their particular urbanity, and under current globalization they still constitute models to parts of the extra-European world	['SDG17']

AbstractPrivate sustainability standards for palm oil – RSPO certification and especially the POIG/No Deforestation standards – show more promise than ASEAN in addressing the political-economic drivers of the fires/haze in Indonesia. ‘Sovereignty-free’ private actors – global NGOs, philanthropic foundations, and social investors – harnessed transnational markets and used consumer product multinationals and Asian palm oil traders/processers as intermediaries to reach oil palm growers previously shielded from private regulation. Exclusion of state actors gave regulatory entrepreneurs a freer hand to institute more stringent standards. This contrasts with ASEAN regional governance where state control of regional governance deflects global and local pressure for change. There are limitations, however, to the reach of voluntary private standards, which cannot address irresponsible cultivation practices in illegal supply chains and those catering to the domestic market, despite NGOs and other private regulatory entrepreneurs acting as ‘functional equivalents’ of state authorities in driving change. Nevertheless, palm oil's economic importance to Indonesia and the global market transformations underway mean that global private standards have a first-mover advantage. However, central state actors have denounced private standards as intrusions on national sovereignty. While private standards have sparked national conversations on sustainability, the political bargaining between state authority, private regulators, and their proponents is only just beginning.</jats:p	['SDG17']
10.1108/jbs-12-2015-0124	Can profit and sustainability goals co-exist? New business models for hybrid firms	Purpose This paper aims to discuss hybrid organizations whose business models blur the boundary between for-profit and nonprofit worlds. With the aim of understanding how hybrid organizations have developed commercially viable business models to create positive social and environmental change, the authors contend that hybrids are altering long-held business norms and conceptions of the role of the corporation in society. Building on an analysis of the most updated literature on hybrid organizations and with the use of case study approach, the purpose of this paper is to derive managerial lessons that traditional businesses may apply to innovate their business models.   Design/methodology/approach This paper has a practical focus to help organizations to develop successful business strategies and design innovative business models. It applies emerging thinking on hybrid business models to provide new insights and ideas on the use of business models as tools for innovating and delivering value. To comply with this, first, the authors discuss the distinctive characteristics of hybrids and the hybrid business model through a concise but comprehensive review of all the literature on hybrid organization, which is still very recent. Second, we relied on a short case study that introduces information technology and digital innovation as the premises of the emergence of a new hybrid business model that adds additional elements to traditional business managers on how to learn from hybrid organizations’ avenues to innovate their business models.   Findings In this paper, the authors aimed to shed light on the management of any organization or initiative that aims to embrace multiple and competing yet potentially synergistic goals, as is increasingly the case in modern corporations. Spotting hidden complementarities of antagonistic assets can be arduous, time-consuming, costly and risky, but businesses driven by innovation may want to keep a close eye on the expanding hybrid sector as a source of future entrepreneurial opportunities. To this regard, hybrid social ventures have the potential to shed light on ways to innovate traditional business models. The essence of studying hybrids is that firms may learn how to innovate their business models in ways that go beyond current conceptualizations, making their mission profitable, rather than making profit their only mission! The research design (literature analysis and case study) allowed the authors to disentangle different innovative business models that hybrids suggest highlight strengths and weaknesses of such business models, understand strategies and capabilities associated with hybrids and transpose all these lessons learned to traditional business managers who constantly struggle for innovation.   Research limitations/implications The main implication is that hybrid organizations may serve as incubators for new practices that can gain scale and impact by infusion into existing corporations. The authors can assist to a process of “hybridization” of incumbent firms, pushing the boundaries of corporate sustainability efforts toward strategies in which profit and social purpose share more equal footing.   Practical implications Firms interested in benefiting from antagonistic assets that can have a dramatic impact on their business model innovation may want to consider some lessons: firms can attempt to build antagonistic assets into their mission, asking themselves what activities they can undertake with the potential to create (or erode) social, environmental and economic value and how these activities might be mediated by the context/environment in which they operate; they can partner with hybrids to benefit from them and absorb competencies from them, so to increase their likelihood to generate value-creating activities and to impact on wider range of stakeholders, including funders, partners, beneficiaries and communities; they can mimic hybrids on how to innovate their business model through the use of the “deliberate resource misfit” dynamic capability, mitigating negative impacts and trade-offs and maximizing positive value spillovers, both for the firms themselves and for the community.   Social implications Sharing know-how with hybrids opens up to ways to innovate business models, and hybrids are much more open to sharing lessons and encouraging others to copy their approaches in a genuine open innovation approach.   Originality/value The main lesson businesses can take away from studying hybrids is that antagonistic assets – and not only profitable complementary ones, as the resource-based view would suggest – do not have to be a burden on profits. Hybrids ground their strategy first and foremost on their beneficiaries, thus dealing with a bundle of antagonistic assets. The primary objective of hybrids is thus to find imaginative ways of generating profits from their given resources rather than acquiring the resources that generate the highest profit. Profit is the ultimate goal of traditional businesses’ mission, but by making profit their only mission, firms risk missing out on the hidden opportunities latent in antagonistic assets. Learning from hybrids about how to align profits and societal impact may be a driver of long-term competitive advantage. </jats:sec	['SDG17']

10.2166/washdev.2017.053	Revealing causal pathways to sustainable water service delivery using FsQCA	This study aimed to build on theory and practice regarding the combinations of conditions that influence water service sustainability when external partners are involved. The study investigates 26 well projects that have been implemented in developing countries with the assistance of Engineers Without Borders-USA (EWB-USA). Using past literature on sustainable water service delivery in developing communities, emergent coding techniques with project documents, and surveys with EWB-USA team members, this study identifies a set of project conditions to conduct fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Findings show that the presence of a water committee cannot alone account for project sustainability. Additional conditions, such as technology and construction processes, project governance, and community engagement practices must also be considered for project sustainability. The relationship between construction quality and financial sustainability is also discussed. Overall, the findings from this research contribute to sector theory and reveal distinct pathways towards sustainable water services. These findings informed recommendations for EWB-USA well project implementation and management, and demonstrate the utility of fsQCA as a tool to navigate the complexities of water service delivery by external partners and improve understanding to increase water service sustainability	['SDG17']
10.1016/j.pld.2016.04.001	History and conservation of wild and cultivated plant diversity in Uganda: Forest species and banana varieties as case studies	AbstractThe history of wild and cultivated plant diversity in Uganda is reviewed, taking forest species and bananas as examples. Palynological research into past human influences on forests is reassessed. The evidence suggests that crops were first introduced into the country at about 1000 BCE, farming communities practicing slash and burn agriculture started to significantly influence the floristic composition of forests during the 1st millennium BCE and there was a major episode of forest reduction at about 1000 CE related to socio-economic change. Bananas were probably introduced in the early centuries CE. The colonial era from 1894 saw the introduction of new concepts of land ownership and the establishment of forest reserves and agricultural stations. Forests and banana diversity are currently under threat, Uganda having a very high rate of deforestation and endemic banana varieties proving susceptible to introduced pests and diseases. It is suggested that, under these circumstances, conservationists take an opportunistic approach to field engagement, making use of favourable local conditions as they arise. Partnerships should be sought with elements of society concerned with sustainable use, provision of ecosystem services and cultural survival to widen the social base of plant conservation. International organisations involved in conservation of plant genetic resources and wild plant species should collaborate with one another to develop the conceptual basis of plant conservation, to make it more relevant to countries like Uganda	['SDG17']

It traces the marginalization of a rights-based approach to migration and the streamlining of migration governance into business-friendly migration management and a geopolitical securitization agenda. It also reviews the trajectory towards factoring migration into a global development policy discourse as formulated in the UN 2030 Development Agenda. Specifically, it indicates that the inclusion of migration into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) may promote migrant workers rights because several of these invoke universal human rights instruments, social protection and the observance of the ILO decent work agenda. However, this will only be possible if civil society critically engages powerful state and non-state actors in the process of monitoring the SDGs implementation, and resists their streamlining into investment and free trade neoliberal development regimes.</p	['SDG17']

10.29024/aogh.14	The medical education partnership initiative effect on increasing health professions education and research capacity in Mozambique	Background: Mozambique is an emerging lower income country (LIC) on the southeast coast of Africa. There are significant workforce shortages in medical and health professions in the country. Mozambique was one of 12 countries in Africa that was awarded a grant through the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) in 2010. The overarching goal of MEPI Mozambique was to enhance the capacity of medical schools to train the medical and scientific leadership corps that the country required to facilitate the training of doctors and other health professionals, and thus to strengthen the national health system. Objective: The aim of this article is to provide an overview of MEPI Mozambique activities, its outcomes and successes, lessons learned, and how these have sustainably strengthened the health sector in the country. What Was Done: The Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM) formed a partnership with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) to implement MEPI Mozambique. A range of activities in medical education, research capacity development, electronic connectivity and information technology, and developing relationships among medical education stakeholders, were performed. Outcomes and Effects: The activities and innovations introduced under MEPI became part of the daily routine in medical education in Mozambique, dramatically influencing attitudes and perceptions. Joint research with partners leveraged research capabilities. The creation of a research support center offered a mechanism to sustainably build on MEPI achievements. Scientific knowledge generated through research has been translated into practice and policy, and has improved the working environment for health professionals. The use of interactive communication technologies enabled the scaling up of training and research in sustainable ways, and created communities of practice. Conclusion: MEPI Mozambique developed transformational long-term partnerships between UEM, UCSD and other partners. These are changing the trajectory of medical and health professions education in Mozambique and creating sustainable capacity for research	['SDG17']

10.1051/matecconf/201818102007	Travel mode choice preferences of urban commuters in Kuching City, Malaysia based on stated preference data	One aspect of Kuching City that has not progressed in tandem with the rest of the city is the public transport system, which is relatively old and almost non-existent. Transport and City planners seem to be at their wit’s end in coming up with satisfactory solutions to Kuching’s public transportation woes. In current situation, many proposals, but none have proven workable. As a result, representative buses remain a rare sight on Kuching city’s roads. To achieve a sustainable public transport industry, the old buses need to be regenerated and replaced with modern buses. The objectives of the intended study are to explore the consumer’s travel behaviour by employing mode choice modelling. Consequently, a study was conducted in Kuching City Area by using stated preference technique, analysed and compiled by using SPSS.17 multiple linear regressions analysis. In this context, discrete choice analysis was used to examine the relationship between independent variables (travel time, waiting time, fares and comfort) and dependent variables (choice of respondent whether to consume old bus or choose new bus services). A total of 2000 respondents were interviewed. The findings showed that for the trips purpose, fares and comfortability were the primary factors that reflected the decision or behaviour of the respondents asked. It was discovered that there is a significant relationship between the choice of the respondents and comfortability. It also appeared that longer travel time did not affect for the traveler’s choice at this stage. Hence, the study suggests that the local authority and the bus operators should establish a “quality partnership” and working together in order to come out with a much better and appropriate transport policy and schemes for the existing public transportation systems, especially bus services	['SDG17']

10.3390/su10124636	Planning &amp; open-air demonstrating smart city sustainable districts	The article is focused on the &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; activities carried out by the University of Genoa at Savona Campus facilities in order to implement the &ldquo;Living Lab Smart City&rdquo;. The idea is to transform the Savona Campus in a Living Lab of the City of the Future: smart technologies in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and energy sectors were installed in order to show a real application of the Smart City concept to population and external stakeholders. Moreover, special attention was given to the environment, personal wellbeing, and social equalities. The sustainable energy Research Infrastructures (RIs) of Savona Campus allowed enhancement of the applied research in degree programs and the collaboration with several companies. In particular, an important partnership with the Italian electric Distribution System Operator (DSO), ENEL S.p.A., started in 2017 to test the capability of these RIs to operate disconnected from the National Grid, relying only on the supply of renewables and storage systems. The &ldquo;Living Lab Smart City&rdquo; is an important action to reduce the carbon footprint of the Savona Campus and to increase the awareness of students, teachers and researchers towards Sustainable Development in Higher Education Institutes	['SDG17']
